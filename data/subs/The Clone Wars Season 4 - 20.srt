1
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,960
<i>Abandoned!</i>

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,000
<i>After an assassination attempt by
his forsaken apprentice, Asajj Ventress,</i>

3
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,460
<i>Count Dooku launches
a brutal counterattack</i>

4
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,500
<i>against the Nightsisters,
massacring the entire clan.</i>

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,340
<i>Forced into exile, Ventress wanders
far into the Outer Rim,</i>

6
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:37,310
<i>among the castaways
and vagabonds of the galaxy,</i>

7
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,970
<i>seeking her new life that
was foretold by Mother Talzin.</i>

8
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,350
Prow. Straight up.

9
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:36,110
Another.

10
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,370
Hey, there.

11
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,330
What's a pretty bald babe like you
doing in a desert like this?

12
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,540
Get lost.

13
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,080
Hey! I'm talkin' to you, lady.

14
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,430
I'm not much of a talker.

15
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,240
Uh, compliments of the lizard in the back.

16
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,420
What do you want?

17
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,090
I'm Bossk and this is Latts Razzi.

18
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,130
- We're bounty hunters, and...
- We have a problem.

19
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,550
Hmm.

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,610
What kind of problem?

21
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,760
You just killed one of our team.

22
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,140
Sorry about that.

23
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:56,360
So where did you get the lightsabers?

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,820
Stole them.

25
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,610
Bounty hunter, then?

26
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,660
No.

27
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,290
Ever considered it?
You certainly have the right.

28
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,220
Disposition.

29
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,880
Never thought about it. Does it pay well?

30
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,920
Very well.

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,220
We have a job to do and you owe us a man.

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,970
Join our merry band of bounty hunters,
or we turn you over to the authorities.

33
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,060
What do I have to do?

34
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,820
Hey, Bossk, who's your girlfriend?

35
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,130
Shut up, Dengar.

36
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,620
Hey, boss.

37
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
"Boss." This is your boss?

38
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,960
You got a problem with that?
My name's Boba, and this is Highsinger.

39
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,510
I see you've already met Bossk and Latts.

40
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,970
What's your name?

41
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,510
I don't have a name.

42
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,830
So it's going to be like that, huh?

43
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,690
Look, kid, I don't take orders very well.

44
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,310
Especially from someone of your stature,

45
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,980
and obvious lack of experience.

46
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,910
She killed Oked. So she agreed
to fill in for him on this particular job.

47
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,950
Or, like I said,

48
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,130
we can always find another way
to settle your debt.

49
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:45,670
That won't be necessary, I'm a
little short of work right now anyway.

50
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,930
She's a little rough around the edges,
but we need six hunters.

51
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,470
Without her, we got no job.

52
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,190
Fine. Let's get going.

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,230
Don't we settle first?

54
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,650
What? You don't trust us?

55
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,570
When the job's done, you'll get your cut.
Just like the rest of us.

56
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:42,230
Welcome. Welcome. I am Major Rigosso.

57
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,320
We are thrilled to have you here.

58
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,110
Please allow me the pleasure
of explaining the mission.

59
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,740
These elevators will take us beneath
the surface of the planet below.

60
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,410
Waiting there is a sub tram
which is carrying very precious cargo.

61
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,000
Your mission is to protect the tram as
it makes its way to the final destination.

62
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,460
And what is this precious cargo?

63
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,380
That's none of your concern.

64
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,800
Just make sure it gets where it's going.

65
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,260
And where exactly is it going?

66
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,440
To my lord, Otua Blank. He rules
over this planet with an iron fist.

67
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,150
If you fail to protect his cargo,

68
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,320
losing your bounty
will be the least of your concerns.

69
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,740
This way, please.

70
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,580
Why do we have to travel by sub tram?

71
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,200
Wouldn't it be easier
just to land at our destination?

72
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,910
You'd think so.

73
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,460
The atmosphere of our planet
is completely pressurized,

74
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,390
leaving all aerial travel impossible.

75
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,340
If we attempted to land
on the planet's surface,

76
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,760
our ship would immediately implode.

77
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,300
Sub tram it is then.

78
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,860
So why hire six expensive
bounty hunters to move cargo?

79
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,990
There's a group of marauders

80
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,620
that would like nothing more
than to hijack my master's cargo.

81
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,370
So far, my men have been
ineffective against them.

82
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,880
They've arrived.

83
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,730
No matter what happens,
do not open this box.

84
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,230
You make the rules, I follow them.

85
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,620
So that's it? That is
what we're protecting?

86
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,960
Who cares? As long as we get paid.

87
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:21,720
My lord, Otua Blank, will meet us
on the other side. Good luck.

88
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,950
After them!

89
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,880
<i>Okay, Boba, the cargo is secure.</i>

90
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,420
<i>Latss, you and Highsinger stay there.</i>

91
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,380
<i>I'll be in the engine room with Bossk.</i>

92
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,800
<i>I sent the new girl and Dengar to the back.</i>

93
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,850
Hello, darling, looks like we're securing
the back platform together.

94
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,270
Wonderful.

95
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,490
So what do you think is in that box?

96
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,990
Whatever it is,
it better be worth all this effort.

97
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:56,320
Heads up, people, we got company.

98
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,700
Latts, Highsinger, get ready!

99
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,950
They're here!

100
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,870
Protect the cargo at all costs.

101
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,900
Goodbye.

102
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,750
Oh, no, you don't.

103
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,590
Poodoo.

104
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,090
I'll check the cargo, stay here.

105
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,870
Oh, hey, boss, you'd better get down.

106
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:42,570
They're boarding from the rear,
I could use a hand back here!

107
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,700
Hold your position!
Bossk, get to the back and help the rookie!

108
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,590
I'm on it.

109
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,330
Stop him, he's the leader!

110
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,410
You!

111
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,620
I want what's mine!

112
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,380
Over my dead body.

113
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,760
What?

114
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,290
Don't worry, I'll protect you.

115
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:09,520
Hey!

116
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,260
Pluma, are you okay?

117
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,060
Brother, you came for me!

118
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,480
Of course I did.

119
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,030
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

120
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,280
Stay back!

121
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,820
That little girl
is worth a lot of money to me.

122
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,700
Now step aside!

123
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,400
Stop it!

124
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,710
Krismo!

125
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,590
That girl's crazy! We're protecting her?

126
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,350
Try not to be such a novice.

127
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,430
Open your eyes, she's on their side.

128
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,190
It doesn't matter,
tie them down and let's finish this job.

129
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,610
Is this really necessary?
None of this was my choice.

130
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,790
I never asked to be ripped away
from my home, from my family.

131
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,120
You'll never know what it's like.

132
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,920
I wish I didn't, but I do.

133
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,430
You're just doing this for the money.
It's just another job to you.

134
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:23,560
You don't even care what's going
to happen to us once it's over.

135
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,640
Hey, rookie! I need you in the back.

136
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,820
You're right, you are just another job
that I couldn't care less about.

137
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,570
Don't move.

138
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,550
We're almost to the drop-off point.

139
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,040
Soon, I'll be delivering
that brat to the warlord

140
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,250
and collecting a handsome bounty
which you will get your share of.

141
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,300
Share of? There's only two of us left.

142
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,880
I get half.

143
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,890
Half? Please. You just got to the game.

144
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,900
Boy, don't test me.

145
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,350
I will be delivering the cargo
and collecting the bounty.

146
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,480
No one of true importance
would lower themselves

147
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:17,240
to trade with a mere boy.

148
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,400
Boy? You have no idea
who you're talking to.

149
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,530
I have been in charge
of this whole operation...

150
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,340
No, you have no idea

151
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,160
who you are talking to.

152
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,570
Welcome!

153
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,940
Ah! Finally,

154
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,280
my bride.

155
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,740
Uh, bride?

156
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,080
Uh-uh-uh.

157
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,290
Bounty first.

158
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:15,850
Your unmarked credits as promised.

159
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,430
Enjoy!

160
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,890
My bride! At last!

161
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:36,230
Ugh!

162
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,300
You pay my price first
then you get the girl.

163
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,400
How do I know you won't take the
credits and then hand us over?

164
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,320
You don't.

165
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,510
Run along now.

166
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,540
Thank you.

167
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,530
You made it? I don't believe it!

168
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,410
Here's the payment,
I already subtracted my share.

169
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,750
Boba's is in there too,
make sure he gets it.

170
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,590
Where is he?

171
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,920
He'll turn up.

172
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,260
Well, you certainly turned out to
be quite the member of the team,

173
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,730
didn't you?

174
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,310
I'm not part of any team.

175
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,850
You're too good for us now, is that it?

176
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,950
No. Once I was just like you,

177
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,480
