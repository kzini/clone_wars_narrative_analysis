1
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,545
Watch it.

2
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,580
You actually captured him. I'm impressed.

3
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,207
That is what the council wanted.

4
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:26,127
Still. You succeeded
where many have failed.

5
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,422
I've learned from the best, including you.

6
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,677
I wish I was good at something
other than war.

7
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,850
Your people need a new kind of leader.

8
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,815
My sister tried that.
I never understood her idealism.

9
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,031
Commander. I have the council waiting.

10
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,785
And Master Skywalker?
Were you able to contact him?

11
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,871
He was at the meeting
when I left to get you.

12
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,624
Go on. I can handle this.

13
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,562
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

14
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,815
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the Chancellor.

15
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,485
If he does not give up
his emergency powers

16
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,154
after the destruction of Grievous,

17
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,531
then he should be removed from office.

18
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,827
The Jedi Council
would have to take control of the Senate

19
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,079
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

20
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:48,626
To a dark place,
this line of thought will carry us.

21
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,545
Hmm.

22
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,673
Great care, we must take.

23
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,598
I understand your mission was a success.

24
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,018
Yes. I have Maul in custody.

25
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,355
I will escort Commander Rex
when he delivers him to Coruscant.

26
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,067
A great service to the Republic,
you have done.

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,361
I did my duty as a citizen.

28
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,905
Not as a Jedi.

29
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,159
No. Not yet.

30
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,291
Actually, I was hoping
to speak with General Skywalker.

31
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,002
I sent him to inform the Chancellor

32
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,422
that General Grievous
has indeed been located on Utapau.

33
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,132
Master Kenobi?

34
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,177
Engaged the enemy, he has.

35
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,846
Then the war could be over soon.

36
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,016
That depends on the Chancellor.

37
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,769
What do you mean?

38
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:54,317
I'm sorry, citizen. These matters
are for the council to discuss.

39
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,237
I understand.

40
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:13,503
Ahsoka. More to say, have you?
A message for Skywalker, perhaps?

41
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:24,472
No, Master. Thank you.
I'll tell him myself when I see him.

42
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,436
May the Force be with you, Padawan.

43
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,109
You didn't tell them
what Maul said about General Skywalker.

44
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,612
No, I didn't.

45
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,167
Impressive. I suspect even Maul
couldn't get out of there.

46
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,920
A relic of a bygone era

47
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,757
when Mandalorians had reason
to imprison you Force-wielding maniacs.

48
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,010
I thought your sister
outlawed such devices.

49
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,598
She did. This is the last one.

50
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,444
Goodbye, Ahsoka Tano.

51
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,921
Something on your mind?

52
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:33,513
As a Jedi, we were trained to be
keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

53
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,684
But all I've been since I was a Padawan
is a soldier.

54
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,439
Well, I've known no other way.

55
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,526
Gives us clones all a mixed feeling
about the war.

56
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,738
Many people wish it never happened.

57
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,410
But without it, we clones wouldn't exist.

58
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,956
Well, then perhaps some good has come
from all of it.

59
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,170
The Republic couldn't have asked for
better soldiers, nor I a better friend.

60
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,765
Commander Rex,
the latest briefing has come in.

61
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,808
Want to have a look?

62
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,644
It might have an update
on General Kenobi's efforts.

63
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,148
You go. I'm sure it's more good news.

64
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,593
You must choose.

65
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,388
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

66
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,307
It's not the Jedi way.
He must live.

67
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,743
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

68
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,435
- Please don't.
- I need him.

69
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,523
Unlimited power!

70
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,278
What have I done?

71
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,781
Anakin?

72
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,747
Execute Order 66.

73
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,749
Yes, Lord Sidious.

74
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:33,258
Rex. It's Anakin. I feel like
something terrible has happened.

75
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,807
Rex?

76
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:43,309
No!

77
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,270
I'll do it.

78
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:47,439
Rex, what's happening?

79
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,024
Stay back!

80
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,112
Find him. Find him.

81
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,322
Fives. Find him! Fives!

82
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,291
Rex!

83
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,841
- She's down. She's down.
- Hold your fire! We got her!

84
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,752
Sir, are you all right?

85
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,547
Fine, just tired is all.

86
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:57,842
I want you to go to the detention level.
Execute Maul.

87
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,302
Yes, sir.

88
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,720
All right, men.

89
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,643
All right.
We know Ahsoka Tano is on board.

90
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,063
She's been marked for termination
by Order 66.

91
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:13,066
Under this directive,
any and all Jedi leadership

92
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,319
must be executed for treason
against the Republic.

93
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:21,408
Any soldier that does not comply with the
order will also be executed for treason.

94
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,493
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

95
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:26,329
There are only so many places
to hide on this ship.

96
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,500
Gather up search parties. We'll fan out
and move section by section.

97
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,420
Come on. Let's get moving.

98
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,958
Look out!

99
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,218
Don't make me regret this.

100
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:33,021
You... You survived.

101
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,400
Is this your doing?
Choose your words carefully.

102
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:40,737
No, no. It was not my doing.

103
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,575
I do not know what has occurred,
but, surely, you have felt it.

104
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,579
The voices crying out. The death.

105
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,583
The clones turned against me. Even Rex.

106
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,504
I don't know why,
they just suddenly weren't themselves.

107
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,176
Brilliant. Brilliant.

108
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,851
I was not privy to my master's plan,
but now, now I see it.

109
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:16,356
He turned the Jedi's own army
against them.

110
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,362
Well, you've done the right thing
by coming to me.

111
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:26,366
Only together can we survive this.
Now, if you will follow my lead...

112
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,036
You don't understand.
I'm not here to team up with you.

113
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,206
I need a diversion, and you're it.

114
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,710
Now go cause some chaos.
It's what you're good at.

115
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:47,637
Uh,
care to give me a fighting chance?

116
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,434
I'm not rooting for you. Now get going.

117
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,454
Sir, we finished our sweep
of the detention level.

118
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:15,915
The prisoner has escaped.
There's no sign of Tano or Maul.

119
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,669
Destroy the escape pods
and increase security on the hangar decks.

120
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:20,754
Right away, sir.

121
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,537
Shh.

122
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,539
R7, I need your help.

123
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,877
I know. I know.

124
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,295
Shh. Quiet.

125
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,556
I don't know. I don't know
why the clones are doing this.

126
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,518
But we might be able
to do something about it.

127
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,146
Are you sure you wanna help?

128
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,606
It could be dangerous.

129
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,238
Okay, let's get started.
R7, patch into the central computer.

130
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,909
Bring up every secure file
on Clone Trooper CT-5555.

131
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,376
Okay, Rex. What am I looking for?

132
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:53,430
An independent investigation confirmed
that the Clone Trooper CT-5555

133
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,100
experienced a malfunction
with his inhibitor chip.

134
00:16:57,183 --> 00:17:01,980
Both the Senate committee and the
Jedi Council have accepted these findings.

135
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:08,194
However, a grievance report
was filed by CT-7567.

136
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:09,988
R7, bring up that report.

137
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,699
It's sealed?

138
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,536
Try Anakin's pass code. 8-1-0-8.

139
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,292
I already know this report is gonna fall
on deaf ears,

140
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,879
but I owe it to Fives
to record what I saw.

141
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:32,761
I'm not sure I believe it myself,
but there's a possibility

142
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,889
that the inhibitor chips
the Kaminoans put inside of us

143
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:40,643
have a purpose
that we don't yet fully understand.

144
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,024
Fall back! Fall back!

145
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:14,219
Ridge is down!
Maul's advancing toward the main hangar!

146
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,554
You must seal
the blast doors. Stop his advance!

147
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:20,809
Seal the blast door! Now!

148
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:35,824
Trooper, did you seal the doors?
Trooper? If you read this, seal the door.

149
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,034
We want to redirect his approach. Over.

150
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,254
Hey, hey. Out of the way!

151
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,057
Are you cross-wired?

152
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:09,649
Rex. I think I know what's happening.
I saw your report on Fives.

153
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,028
It isn't your fault. You were programmed.

154
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,782
Your mind was altered to do this
when you were very young. I can help you.

155
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,118
Where is she?

156
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,120
I'm right here.

157
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,877
Careful. We're trying not to hurt him.

158
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,547
They've got the commander.
Bring the charges.

159
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,425
Cheep, are all the doors sealed,
so the way is clear?

160
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:40,096
Okay. Let's get him to the medical bay.

161
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,735
Move it! Move it!

162
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:59,032
Start working on these doors.

163
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,216
R7, run a scan.

164
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,885
See if you can find the inhibitor chip
the report talked about.

165
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:44,953
But the chip has to be there. Check again.

166
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:58,383
How close are they?

167
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,015
G-G, if they override the door controls,
you have to reseal it fast.

168
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:09,561
R7, anything?

169
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:28,204
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

170
00:21:28,288 --> 00:21:31,041
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

171
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:34,044
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

172
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:37,589
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

173
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,301
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

174
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:45,972
You found it?

175
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,065
R7, get him under and remove that thing.

176
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,652
I don't know if it will work,
but if it doesn't, we're dead anyway.

177
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:08,703
Go! Go!

178
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,335
Get ready on the door.

179
00:22:42,195 --> 00:22:43,947
The door. G-G, the door!

180
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:55,333
Rex? Are you okay?

181
00:22:56,459 --> 00:23:00,380
Yeah. Yeah, kid. I'm okay.

182
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:02,799
I'm sorry for what happened earlier.

183
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,593
I almost killed you.

184
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,721
How widespread is this?

185
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,808
Ahsoka, it's all of us.

186
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:14,227
The entire Grand Army of the Republic

187
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:19,315
has been ordered to hunt down
and destroy the Jedi Knights.
