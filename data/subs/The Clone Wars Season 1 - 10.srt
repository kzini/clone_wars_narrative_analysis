1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,970
<i>Viceroy Gunray escapes!</i>

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,270
<i>En route to Coruscant
to stand trial for war crimes,</i>

3
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:26,150
<i>evil Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has broken free of his Jedi escort.</i>

4
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,710
<i>With the help of
Count Dooku's sinister agents,</i>

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,450
<i>the villainous viceroy has
made a daring getaway.</i>

6
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,710
<i>Alerted to the bold prison break,</i>

7
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,530
<i>Jedi Master Kit Fisto has traced
the stolen ship to a remote system,</i>

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,050
<i>hoping to recapture Gunray
and return him to justice.</i>

9
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:50,230
I know we're in the middle
of nowhere, R6,

10
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,530
but that's the Republic beacon
we're looking for.

11
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,290
Contact the Outer Rim command.

12
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,750
Master Luminara,

13
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,310
I have tracked the location of
our stolen ship to the Vassek system.

14
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,890
<i>So has your old Padawan,
Nahdar Vebb.</i>

15
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,690
<i>He's already on the surface.</i>

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,890
It'll be great to see Nahdar again.

17
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,470
<i>I'll transmit the coordinates
for the rendezvous point.</i>

18
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,890
<i>And, Master Fisto...</i>

19
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:18,730
<i>sorry we lost that slimy double-dealer.</i>

20
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,130
Don't worry, Ahsoka,

21
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,690
we'll catch Gunray yet.

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,930
<i>Good hunting.</i>

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,250
Well, I can't see anything either.

24
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,150
You'll be fine, R6.

25
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,770
Just keep a lookout for me, okay?

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,690
Nahdar.

27
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,750
Congratulations on passing the trials.

28
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,650
I'm sorry the war prevented me from
seeing your training through to the end.

29
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,670
You were missed, Master,

30
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,070
but it is an honor to finally serve
beside you as a Knight.

31
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,890
General,

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,170
we've pinpointed the tracking beacon's
location to the south end of the gorge.

33
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,050
Then let's have a look.

34
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,970
Allow me to show the way.

35
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,570
Charming.

36
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,650
Let's not keep the Viceroy waiting.

37
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,370
Niner, Bel,
look after the ships.

38
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,450
Yes, sir.

39
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,250
No guards?

40
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,430
That's odd.

41
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,830
The entrance looks sealed.

42
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,530
We specialize in making entrances.

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,170
This will make less noise.

44
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,810
Patience, the both of you.

45
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,450
A second look usually pays off.

46
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,450
What's this?

47
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,010
I sense there's something here.

48
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,450
Scanners are negative, General.

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,810
Well, that was something.

50
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,490
<i>All droids stay on guard.</i>

51
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,610
<i>Be ready for anything.</i>

52
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,610
Roger, roger.

53
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,450
<i>Double shifts for everyone.</i>

54
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,430
Uh, Viceroy?

55
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,930
<i>You must protect me at all costs.</i>

56
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,610
Uh, Viceroy,
the Jedi are here.

57
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,250
<i>I know they're near.</i>

58
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,710
<i>Once those Jedi pick up my trail,</i>

59
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,970
<i>they never leave me alone.</i>

60
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,010
They're right behind you.

61
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,330
<i>What? Where?</i>

62
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,570
<i>Do something.</i>

63
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,090
<i>You, blast them!</i>

64
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,310
I didn't forget to teach you restraint,

65
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:11,690
did I, my old Padawan?

66
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,490
I am sorry, Master.

67
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,990
I got carried away.

68
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,330
Those who have power
should restrain themselves from using it.

69
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,390
<i>Lieutenant,
did you get them?</i>

70
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,110
No, but we have you, Viceroy.

71
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,830
<i>You have nothing, Jedi fools.</i>

72
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,570
<i>I welcome you to your doom.</i>

73
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,430
The tracking beacon.

74
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,830
They knew we were coming.

75
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,050
I should have known
Gunray wasn't here.

76
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,150
At the first sight of us,

77
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,610
he would have run off screaming
like the coward he is.

78
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,930
<i>I apologize for the deception, Master Jedi.</i>

79
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:47,250
Count Dooku.

80
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:50,650
You have a great talent
for unexpected appearances.

81
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,650
<i>It's a shame you came so far
to be frustrated.</i>

82
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,170
<i>While the Viceroy is
unavailable for capture,</i>

83
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,370
<i>allow me to offer you
an alternative prize.</i>

84
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,430
This has got to be a trap.

85
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,650
It looks like Dooku is trying to
catch someone,

86
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,230
and we are the bait.

87
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,010
But who has the trap been set to catch?

88
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,970
Shall we find out?

89
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,370
This place looks like a shrine
to that strange warrior.

90
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:00,170
This is the lair of General Grievous.

91
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,130
Yes, my lord?

92
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,850
<i>General, the ongoing stalemate
in the war has become unacceptable.</i>

93
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:16,070
<i>There is concern
you have lost your focus.</i>

94
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,690
<i>Lord Sidious demands
more dramatic results,</i>

95
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,170
<i>more dead Jedi.</i>

96
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,950
You expect victory over Jedi,

97
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,290
but all you give me to fight them
is battle droids.

98
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,810
These must be trophies
taken from the Jedi he's murdered.

99
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,890
There are so many.

100
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,130
Why would Dooku want to
set a trap for his best general?

101
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,130
It doesn't make sense.

102
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,390
Are we the bait,
or is Grievous the bait?

103
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,670
We must consider who this trap is for.

104
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:56,370
<i>General, your droid is tracking
an incoming ship.</i>

105
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,310
It matches a description
of General Grievous' fighter.

106
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,330
It's headed our way.

107
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,410
Keep out of sight
and stand by for further orders.

108
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,650
Capturing Grievous
could turn the tide of the war.

109
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,770
And if he doesn't know we're here,

110
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,850
we could take him down easy.

111
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,970
Don't underestimate him.

112
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:14,330
We'll need a plan.

113
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,570
Guards?

114
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,050
Gore?

115
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,850
Gore, where are you?

116
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,530
Welcome home, General.

117
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,050
I'm afraid
I must request your surrender.

118
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,890
Cooperate, Grievous,

119
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,130
and perhaps the Senate will be merciful.

120
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,010
It is you who shall get no mercy.

121
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,370
Cables!

122
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,030
Don't let him go!

123
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,910
We got him.

124
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,150
Don't let him cut the lines!

125
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,870
Hold him.

126
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,710
Don't make me destroy you.

127
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,870
Come and get me.

128
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,830
Cut him off!

129
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,730
- Where'd he go?
- The clones got in the way.

130
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,030
I could have taken him.

131
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,510
Let's take care of our wounded.

132
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,390
Doctor, where are you?

133
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,990
Don't be upset with me, master.

134
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,410
If you were a better fighter,

135
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,590
we would not be having
this conversation.

136
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,730
Look what you let those Jedi do to you.

137
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,430
You're a walking scrap pile.

138
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,730
What a mess.

139
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,470
It's going to take me forever
to get you back into decent shape.

140
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,710
I'll go fetch your spare parts.

141
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,990
What happened to my bodyguards?

142
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,510
They were remotely deactivated
for recharge.

143
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,830
I thought you did it.

144
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,630
Lock down the perimeter.

145
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,210
Let me go after Grievous myself,
Master.

146
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,510
Patience, Nahdar.

147
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,670
You may no longer be a Padawan,

148
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,230
<i>but you are not ready
to take on Grievous.</i>

149
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,790
<i>It's time we retreated.</i>

150
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:54,310
You are not going anywhere.

151
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,510
It looks like we're going to
have to fight after all.

152
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,710
- Green scout to watcher base.
- <i>Copy.</i>

153
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,110
<i>This is watcher base, over.</i>

154
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,830
<i>Contact the fleet at Besteene.</i>

155
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,770
Inform them we've engaged Grievous
and require reinforcements.

156
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:11,670
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

157
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,910
Better warm up the shuttle's
long-range transmitter.

158
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,390
Get out of there, R6, now!

159
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,870
R6? R6?

160
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,270
<i>You've run out of time.</i>

161
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,930
Why don't you come out, General?

162
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,590
Show us some of that Separatist hospitality.

163
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,850
<i>Patience.</i>

164
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:04,130
<i>In the meantime,</i>

165
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,710
<i>please experience
all my home has to offer.</i>

166
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,430
<i>It has been prepared
for uninvited guests like you.</i>

167
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,470
General, I know you're watching.

168
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,990
We've seen the lower levels of your home.

169
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,070
We're not impressed.

170
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,890
Good, Jedi, good.

171
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,270
You will provide some sport for me yet.

172
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,750
Gore, time to entertain our guests.

173
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,630
Stand firm.

174
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,430
There might be worse things here
than Grievous.

175
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,230
Looks like you're right about that, sir.

176
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,750
Good-bye, Jedi.

177
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,290
Master, the armor patches
are getting cold,

178
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,590
and contrary to your belief,
I do have other things to do.

179
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:27,310
Proceed with my repair.

180
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,950
Sometimes I wonder
why you submitted to the changes.

181
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,330
Improvements!
I submit to no one.

182
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,750
I chose them.
Now get on with it.

183
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,590
There may be some discomfort.

184
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,520
Shoot him, Commander!

185
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,160
Grievous is going to pay for this.

186
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,440
I will destroy him.

187
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,840
I understand your pain,

188
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,840
but you forget your teachings, Nahdar.

189
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,240
Revenge is not the Jedi way.

190
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,720
But in this war, strength prevails.

191
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,960
The rules have changed.

192
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,040
Perhaps you are the one
who has changed.

193
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,880
Come now, we need to keep moving.

194
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's see if Gore is finished
playing with the Jedi.

195
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:20,880
Huh?

196
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,480
Where are they?

197
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,360
Gore?

198
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,560
Master, you have an incoming
transmission from Count Dooku.

199
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,880
<i>General, I understand
the Jedi have infiltrated your lair.</i>

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,980
<i>Your recent defeats at their hands</i>

201
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,760
<i>have shaken my faith in your ability
to lead the droid army.</i>

202
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,440
<i>I'm sure you can understand my need
to reassess your effectiveness.</i>

203
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,280
You!

204
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,740
You deactivated my guards.

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,800
You let the Jedi in here
so you would test me.

206
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,680
<i>I do hope you emerge victorious.</i>

207
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,840
Ha!

208
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,800
- <i>It's time for you to prove--</i>
- Oops.

209
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,380
All right, Count.

210
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,760
I'll play your little game.

211
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,440
In your condition, you need to rest.

212
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,760
I will rest when the Jedi are dead.

213
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,400
You were right, Master.

214
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,360
That exit must lead to the control room.

215
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,120
Oh, what have we here?

216
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,320
The uninvited guests.

217
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,520
Let's go.

218
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,580
Master,

219
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,880
<i>the Jedi are about
to enter the control room.</i>

220
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,580
Nahdar, inside.
Hurry!

221
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,280
No, you go.
I will hold him off.

222
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,860
There's no time to argue.

223
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,980
<i>We can't just run.</i>

224
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,160
<i>We must finish him.</i>

225
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,480
Nahdar, hurry!

226
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,840
I have been waiting for this.

227
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,720
Nahdar!

228
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,160
Greetings, young Jedi.

229
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,180
<i>Where is your Master?</i>

230
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,340
How exciting.

231
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,280
<i>You will find out soon enough.</i>

232
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,980
You can't defeat us all.

233
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,880
Of course I can.

234
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,620
Get him, Master.

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,800
Kill him.

236
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
Wait.
Where's the other Jedi?

237
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,280
Oh, no.

238
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,800
No.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,940
<i>I will kill you all.</i>

240
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,000
<i>Do you hear me, Jedi?</i>

241
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:03,960
R6?

242
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,960
Is that you?

243
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,460
Meet me at the south landing platform.

244
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,680
I'll be right there.

245
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm coming for you next, Fisto.

246
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,040
I'll be gone by the time you get here.

247
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,720
R6, I'm at the platform.

248
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,880
Where are you?

249
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,760
Going somewhere?

250
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,960
Huh?

251
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,100
You might have been
a proud warrior once,

252
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,940
but now you're just a pawn
in Dooku's game.

253
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,160
I wield great power, Jedi fool.

254
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,440
That power will only consume you.

255
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,880
How quickly power can change hands.

256
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,120
Surrender, and I promise
you will die quickly.

257
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,480
Stop him!

258
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,480
Let's go home, R6.

259
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,440
Count Dooku,
the Jedi have been defeated.

260
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,360
<i>Victory over the clones
and the young Jedi was expected,</i>

261
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,200
<i>but to best a Jedi Master...</i>

262
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,480
<i>This is truly an accomplishment
worthy of recognition.</i>

263
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,560
The Jedi Fisto escaped.

264
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,640
<i>So there is room for improvement.</i>

265
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,680
What about your former Padawan?

266
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,040
His heart was in the right place,

267
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,960
but he tried to answer
Grievous' power with his own.

268
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,440
To answer power with power,
the Jedi way, this is not.

269
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:59,560
In this war, a danger there is,
of losing who we are.
