1
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,660
<i>Neutral star systems in peril.</i>

2
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,440
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress
command the planet Mandalore</i>

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,640
<i>through the puppet Prime Minister Almec</i>

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,630
<i>while they expand
their criminal enterprise.</i>

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,070
<i>With the Death Watch removed from power</i>

6
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,540
<i>and the Jedi unaware
of the villainous plot,</i>

7
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,280
<i>nothing stands in the way
of Darth Maul's vision</i>

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,610
<i>for a vast criminal empire.</i>

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,080
<i>We now find Duchess Satine imprisoned</i>

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,090
<i>as her few remaining loyal subjects</i>

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,120
<i>make a desperate attempt to rescue her.</i>

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,820
What do you want, you traitor?

13
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,990
We'll never betray you, Auntie Satine.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,170
I'm here to rescue you.

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,920
Korkie.

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,660
Freeze!

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:03,760
Hold it there.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,430
Death Watch.

19
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
Bo.

20
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,380
It's been a long time.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,510
It's okay, Auntie.

22
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,320
She's on our side now.

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,610
Why are you helping now?

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,550
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,350
There was a time
when we weren't enemies.

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,820
Perhaps that time has come again.

27
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,120
Come on.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,290
Let's go.

29
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,130
It's all clear. Come on.

30
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,950
We need to contact the Jedi Council.

31
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,740
Korkie, give me your comlink.

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,010
It won't be any good
unless we get outside the city.

33
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,780
All of the frequencies are jammed.

34
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,050
You are all taking
a terrible risk by helping me.

35
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,820
Nothing we haven't done before.

36
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,990
Right, Auntie?

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,720
Let's get going.

38
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,490
Take 'em out.

39
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,470
Get the duchess clear.

40
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,410
The transmission is still blocked.

41
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,390
You're clear.

42
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,760
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

43
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,230
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,530
<i>My people have been massacred.</i>

45
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,840
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,580
<i>You summoned me, Masters?</i>

47
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,820
<i>This is a message
for Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

48
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,360
<i>I've lost Mandalore.</i>

49
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,960
<i>My people have been massacred,</i>

50
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,660
<i>and Almec is now the prime minister.</i>

51
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,230
<i>I can't explain everything now</i>

52
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>but Almec has the support
of the crime families.</i>

53
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,530
<i>Obi-Wan, I need your help.</i>

54
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,270
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi.

55
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,040
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years.

56
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,280
And according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

57
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,950
they're no longer in league
with the Separatists.

58
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,790
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

59
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,790
it was most likely an independent act

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,220
caused by the Death Watch alone.

61
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,630
Without involvement
from the Separatists,

62
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,740
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

63
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,570
I'm afraid we cannot help.

64
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,540
We cannot just hand Mandalore
over to these crime families

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,200
and let Satine become a martyr.

66
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

67
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,640
makes this situation difficult.

68
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:00,810
Understand your feelings I do,
Obi-Wan.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,310
But to take action,

70
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,750
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

71
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,190
You know what the Senate will decide.

72
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,330
They will not send aid
to a neutral system.

73
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,690
At this time, nothing more can we do.

74
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,970
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

75
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,640
including the renegade
Death Watch soldiers.

76
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,280
But we will find them.

77
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,670
The duchess appears
to have contacted the Jedi

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,110
just as anticipated.

79
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,480
Good.

80
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,580
You have done well.

81
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,610
What of the people?

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,150
You are the legitimate prime minister.

83
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,820
Mandalore is a sovereign planet

84
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:43,120
and you will maintain its neutrality.

85
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,490
And what of the Jedi?

86
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,710
Because of Mandalore's neutrality,

87
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,300
the Jedi have no jurisdiction here.

88
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,970
If Kenobi comes to rescue his friend,

89
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,410
he will have to come alone.

90
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,230
Ah.

91
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,700
Ah!

92
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,140
Anakin, that's the last time
I borrow a ship from you.

93
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,590
You better get your ship looked at.

94
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,650
Oh, it's my friend's ship.

95
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,140
He told me it was perfectly fine.

96
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,490
Terribly sorry about that.

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,490
Do you have a landing permit?

98
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,160
Um, I think I left it in the ship.

99
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,170
Come with me, and I'll get it.

100
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,330
Here to do more
of your master's bidding?

101
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,000
I do my own bidding.

102
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,640
Obi-Wan.

103
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,410
Are you alone?

104
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Yes.

105
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,990
The Jedi Council and Galactic Senate

106
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,250
will be of no help to us here.

107
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,190
I trust you have an escape plan then?

108
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,990
As always, my dear.

109
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,300
There's no record
of a prisoner transfer here.

110
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,600
The orders came from upstairs.

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,210
What's the authorization code?

112
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,110
Oh, um...

113
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Hey, you!

114
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,390
Stop!

115
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
It's the duchess.

116
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,890
She's getting away.

117
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,940
We have to contact my sister for help.

118
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,630
She'll send reinforcements.

119
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,170
Who's your sister?

120
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,120
Brace yourself!

121
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,470
Let's get out of here.

122
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,170
Obi-Wan!

123
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,300
No. It can't be.

124
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,410
We meet again, Kenobi.

125
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Welcome to my world.

126
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,480
Take them back to the palace.

127
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:07,040
Your noble flaw is a weakness
shared by you...

128
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,940
and your duchess.

129
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,010
You should have chosen the dark side,

130
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,550
Master Jedi.

131
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:18,620
Your emotions betray you.

132
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,650
Your fear,

133
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,850
and yes, your anger.

134
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,990
Let your anger deepen your hatred.

135
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,890
Don't listen to him, Obi...

136
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,430
Quiet.

137
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,560
You can kill me,
but you will never destroy me.

138
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,070
It takes strength
to resist the dark side.

139
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,170
Only the weak embrace it.

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,350
It is more powerful than you know.

141
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,540
And those who oppose it
are more powerful

142
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,770
than you'll ever be.

143
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,480
I know where you're from.

144
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,380
I've been to your village.

145
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,020
I know the decision to join
the dark side wasn't yours.

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,720
The Nightsisters made it for you.

147
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,766
Silence!

148
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,990
You think you know me?

149
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,590
It was I who languished for years

150
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,620
thinking of nothing but you.

151
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,560
Nothing but this moment.

152
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,100
And now the perfect tool
for my vengeance

153
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,130
is in front of us.

154
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,270
I never planned on killing you.

155
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,670
But I will make you share
my pain, Kenobi.

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Satine.

157
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,410
Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...

158
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,440
I've loved you always.

159
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,480
I always will.

160
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,730
Do we kill him now, brother?

161
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,400
No.

162
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,800
Imprison him below.

163
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,600
Let him drown in his misery.

164
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:22,240
Take him to his cell to rot.

165
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,860
You summoned me, Chancellor?

166
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,060
Prepare my ship.

167
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,720
- Ah!
- It's the rebels!

168
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,550
Sorry, I don't believe we've met.

169
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,596
You are?

170
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,720
Bo-Katan.

171
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,880
I'm here to rescue you.

172
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,420
That's all you need to know.

173
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,520
Sounds good to me.

174
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,790
You ever used one of these before?

175
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,130
No, but in this case,
I'm a fast learner.

176
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,190
Let's go.

177
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,250
Halt!

178
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,150
Maul must really want you dead.

179
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,450
You have no idea.

180
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,100
Hmm, I sense a presence.

181
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,260
A presence
I haven't felt since...

182
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,130
Master.

183
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,730
Master.

184
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:20,020
I am most impressed to see
you have survived your injuries.

185
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,490
I used your training, Master.

186
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,790
And I have built all this

187
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,060
in hopes of returning to your side.

188
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,800
Hmm.

189
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,870
How unfortunate

190
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,880
that are attempting to deceive me.

191
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,670
Master?

192
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,850
You have become a rival!

193
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:46,150
Go back to your Republic
and tell them what has happened.

194
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,350
That would likely lead
to a Republic invasion

195
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,397
of Mandalore.

196
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,280
Yes, and Maul will die.

197
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,320
But Mandalore will survive.

198
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,550
We always survive.

199
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,320
Now go.

200
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,730
Your Satine's sister, aren't you?

201
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,930
I'm so sorry.

202
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,650
Oof.

203
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,050
Ugh!

204
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,410
Uh!

205
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,030
Brother.

206
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,820
Brother, I am an unworthy apprentice.

207
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:32,860
I'm not like you.

208
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,590
I never was.

209
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,730
Remember, the first
and only reality of the Sith:

210
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,200
There can only be two.

211
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:50,040
And you are no longer my apprentice.

212
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:54,320
You have been replaced.

213
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
Ugh!

214
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,390
Have mercy.

215
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,830
Please.

216
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,990
Please!

217
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,720
There is no mercy.

218
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,100
Do not worry.

219
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:49,780
I'm not going to kill you.

220
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:53,400
I have other uses for you.
