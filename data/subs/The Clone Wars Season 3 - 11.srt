1
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,330
Peace shattered.

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,040
Once promising negotiations
between the Republic and the Separatists

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,830
are now in shambles,

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,790
following a droid suicide bombing
on the capital city-planet of Coruscant.

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,960
As fear and anger prevail,

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,230
the Senate overwhelmingly passes a bill
to deregulate the banks,

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,900
opening the gateway to additional troops
and an increase in fighting.

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,150
Members of the Senate, please. Please!

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,900
How dare they!

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,650
They attack, and now they want peace?

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,280
Chancellor Palpatine,

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,570
may I remind the senators that the peace
proposal was made prior to their assault.

13
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,450
That only highlights its insincerity.

14
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:08,960
Chancellor Palpatine, in light of
this unprovoked attack on Coruscant,

15
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,720
and the vulnerabilities it raises,

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,050
I propose the Republic purchase
an additional five million clone troopers.

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,260
The Republic is already operating
in deep debt.

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,180
How do you propose
we pay for these additional troops?

19
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,690
My people are drafting an emergency
appropriations bill that would raise funds.

20
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,270
From the Banking Clan?

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,270
Yes, of course.

22
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,120
Do you have an alternate means of paying?

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,700
One alternative might be
to stop the war, not escalate it.

24
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,030
Traitor!

25
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,660
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

26
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,410
Whoever attacked the power grid
wants us to continue the fight.

27
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,880
It's a calculated attempt
to destroy the peace process.

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,130
Not everyone
in the Confederacy wants this.

29
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,760
I know this for a fact.

30
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,170
You have Separatist friends, Senator?

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,640
- Whose side are you on?
- Where's your loyalty?

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,930
We will not stand for this!

33
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,360
Please. The young senator from Naboo
makes a point.

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,980
There is no need to...

35
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,370
We have just received a message
from our opponent, Count Dooku.

36
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,670
Your Republic forces have carried
out a barbaric attack on our people,

37
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,340
and among the deaths
was the very sponsor of the peace accord,

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,420
Senator Mina Bonteri.

39
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,880
What? No!

40
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,220
With her needless death,

41
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,730
I must formally withdraw the proposal
for peace offered by our Senate.

42
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,060
We must not show weakness.

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,290
Thank you, Teckla.

44
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,620
Yes, my lady.

45
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,450
I can't believe it.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,950
I just can't believe the Republic
would target Senator Bonteri.

47
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,250
She was the only one
willing to stand up for peace.

48
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,930
You shouldn't believe it.

49
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,300
The Republic's spies are reporting
that Senator Bonteri

50
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,170
was murdered by Dooku's thugs.

51
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,470
That message to the Senate was a ploy
to disguise his true actions.

52
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,140
I am so sorry, Padmé.

53
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,470
If your friend met with a violent end
because of her politics,

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,270
let's make sure
her courageous effort wasn't in vain.

55
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,560
What can we do?

56
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,940
For one, defeat this bill.

57
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,190
Can we really win this war
with the troops that we have?

58
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,070
Let's hope we don't have to.

59
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,490
I'll start lining up support,
but I'll need ammunition.

60
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,370
We can't afford ammunition, remember?

61
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,000
I joke.

62
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,370
Go to the Banking Clan

63
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,210
and see how much interest
they're going to charge for the loan.

64
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,380
The more I know about what
the exact costs of this bill will be,

65
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,800
the better I can make my case to defeat it.

66
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,970
All right. Let's go, Uncle.

67
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,190
You know these Banking Clan people.

68
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,350
Plus, you owe me
for telling such a bad joke.

69
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,020
We will lend the Republic
at our standard interest rate

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,230
of 25%.

71
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,650
What?

72
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,200
25%?

73
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,910
That's outright theft.

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Your previous arrangement with
the Republic was 10%.

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
Please, please.

76
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,370
That was before deregulation.

77
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,870
The same rules don't apply, my dear.

78
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,920
The Separatists don't seem to mind
a rate hike.

79
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,260
In fact, they just secured a loan
to fund an additional

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,310
three million battle droids.

81
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,220
They will wipe us out.

82
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,220
You would let Dooku do that?

83
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,730
You live on Coruscant, too.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,600
We have no stake in this war, Senator.
You know that.

85
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,940
War is distasteful to all of us.

86
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,210
25% interest?

87
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,620
That's a lot of credits.

88
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,760
The interest alone
could completely bankrupt the Republic.

89
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,380
As it is, social services have suffered
because of this war.

90
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,500
Education, infrastructure, healthcare.

91
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:29,430
If we go deeper into debt, the basic
needs of our people will evaporate.

92
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,840
This is good.

93
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,050
It is?

94
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,770
Clearly, taking out a loan
on such obscene terms

95
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,610
would essentially destroy the Republic,
regardless of the outcome of the war.

96
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,440
We only need to sway
another handful of senators,

97
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,700
as long as they don't
buckle to the threats.

98
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,860
What threats?

99
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,700
Some members have received messages
warning them not to vote against the bill.

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,120
Considering what's happened
to your friend Bonteri,

101
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,500
they're frightened.

102
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,290
A mandatory
blackout is in progress.

103
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,500
All citizens report
to the designated safe area.

104
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,130
A mandatory blackout is in progress.

105
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,260
All citizens report
to the designated safe area.

106
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,890
No! No!

107
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,730
Can't you all see this
bill is shortsighted?

108
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,560
Millions of clones won't win this war.

109
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,150
The only winner will be the Banking Clan.

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,990
They want to pass this bill so badly,
they're using scare tactics to sway votes.

111
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,670
I am not intimidated, Senator Amidala.

112
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,160
Then why are you voting
for additional troops?

113
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,300
I happen to believe more clones
are precisely what we need.

114
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,430
And my caucus agrees with me.

115
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,750
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,100
Uncle Ono, what happened?

117
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,060
Two thugs jumped me, but I am fine.

118
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,850
This is outrageous.

119
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,690
Something has to be done.

120
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,190
Padmé, this will not change my mind.

121
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,700
No matter what,
I will vote against the bill.

122
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,720
I see Senator Amidala hasn't given up
her crusade.

123
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,350
She doesn't have the votes, my Lord.

124
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,520
We've taken care of 20 senators.

125
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,570
It may be time to send her a message
as well.

126
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,820
You want us to have a talk with her?

127
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,910
No.

128
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,450
I think something special
is called for in Senator Amidala's case.

129
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:02,120
We're all ears, boss.

130
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,920
Take her out of the game.

131
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,680
As long as senators are being threatened
and attacked,

132
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,100
I'm afraid we don't stand a chance.

133
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,810
Intimidation won't work on everyone.

134
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,810
Senator Farr is proof of that.

135
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,310
Even so, we're still at least
six votes short of a majority.

136
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,940
And you saw how effective
my plea was today.

137
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,940
Some minds can't be altered
no matter what they hear.

138
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,200
From my experience,

139
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,410
it depends a great deal
on who's sending the message.

140
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,950
And what are you thinking?

141
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,450
Bail, you're the finest public speaker
I know.

142
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,330
If anyone can convince the Senate

143
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,516
that voting for this bill
will bankrupt the Republic,

144
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,920
both financially and spiritually, it's you.

145
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,300
It will be dangerous.

146
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,470
I urge you to speak before the full Senate.

147
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,730
I'll need some time to prepare.

148
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,970
Good.

149
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,560
In the meantime, I'll pay another visit
to those still undecided.

150
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,330
I'll be parked just over there, my lady.

151
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,660
Thank you. This way, Uncle.

152
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,330
What does ideology matter at this point?

153
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,040
Is it worth being beaten to death?

154
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,670
Look at what they did to you.

155
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,550
These wounds will heal.

156
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,550
But what about the millions
who are dying in this war?

157
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,840
Who, the clones?

158
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,680
We created them for just that purpose.

159
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,850
They are people.

160
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,310
The people I care about
are my constituents,

161
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,730
the ones who put me in office.

162
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,690
And when was the last time
you ever spoke to your people?

163
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:58,860
Probably the same time you did.

164
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,780
Or you, Senator.

165
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,950
Senator Christo, please.

166
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:09,870
Is there anything we can do to get you
to change your mind?

167
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,710
Where does Senator Organa stand
on all this?

168
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,550
Why isn't he here?

169
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:20,260
Senator Organa is preparing
to speak before the full Senate.

170
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,220
Senator Organa?

171
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,300
Hmm.

172
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,890
I'll listen to what he has to say.

173
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,480
So you are open to voting with us?

174
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,810
I said I'll listen to what he has to say.

175
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,000
Well, it's better than a no.

176
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm sure when Christo and the others hear
what Bail has to say,

177
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,770
they will vote our way.

178
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,760
Can I give you a ride?

179
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,600
My driver's only a block away.

180
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,470
I think I'd like to walk.

181
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,020
But Padmé.

182
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,810
Don't worry, Uncle Ono.

183
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,240
I can take care of myself.

184
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,410
Plus, I can use the fresh air.

185
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,940
Just be careful.

186
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,810
Oh, you're gonna love it!

187
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,210
Put your hands up.

188
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,040
Arrest these bounty hunters.

189
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,420
We'll take care of this, miss.

190
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,380
Drop your weapons
and come with us quietly.

191
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,260
Quietly?

192
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,860
Where's my driver? Where's my...

193
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,400
Hey, my ride!

194
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,600
My eye!

195
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,060
Land the vehicle!

196
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,310
That is a stolen vehicle.

197
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,350
Ugh!

198
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,770
Those bounty hunters
were trying to kill me!

199
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,160
I am a senator!
I demand that you arrest them.

200
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,490
Get your hands in the air.

201
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,460
Ouch!

202
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,670
Don't you think you should
report this to the Jedi Council?

203
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,790
There's nothing they can do.

204
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,630
I know who did it.

205
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,010
They were bounty hunters

206
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,300
paid to stop me from
voting against the troop increase.

207
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,010
What has happened to democracy?

208
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,180
And why doesn't anyone seem to care?

209
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,020
Well, you do.

210
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,560
Forgive me, my lady.

211
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,910
You're not like most politicians.

212
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,150
If only that were enough, Teckla.

213
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,500
Well, you actually talk to the people.

214
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,160
People like me.

215
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,410
Goodnight, my lady.

216
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,710
Teckla.

217
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,210
Tell me. How is your family?

218
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,170
They are fine.

219
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,560
How is the war affecting them?

220
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,840
It hasn't been easy.

221
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,050
And it's only getting worse.

222
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,140
How?

223
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,280
Please, tell me.
Tell me how it's getting worse.

224
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:29,800
You're not gonna get away
like your lady friend, Senator.

225
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,960
Senator!

226
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,130
Medic!

227
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,670
Oh! Padmé!

228
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,800
What is it?

229
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,170
You must come quickly.

230
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
You need to see something.

231
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,890
Bail! What happened?

232
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:25,850
Padmé.

233
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,640
Senator, you need to lie down.

234
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,520
My speech, my speech.

235
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,650
The Senate is expecting me.

236
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,980
- Is there any way...
- I'm sorry.

237
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,240
He's in no condition to even stand.

238
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,716
We need to take him to the hospital.

239
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,660
Of course. Take him at once.

240
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,820
The speech.

241
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,740
Padmé, you must address the Senate.

242
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,410
Only you can do this.

243
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,210
Perhaps we should
get the vote started.

244
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,050
I told Senator Organa
I'd allow him to speak.

245
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:00,180
We have waited long enough.

246
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,680
I agree with Senator Orn Free Taa.

247
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
Let's vote.

248
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,640
You must give the speech in his place.

249
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,530
But they're expecting to hear
from the great Bail Organa.

250
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,520
He carries a certain weight.

251
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,610
He's seen as a voice of reason.

252
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,860
You are very respected.

253
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,740
As a partisan.
I've been against this bill from day one.

254
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,370
If they didn't listen to me before,
why would they listen now?

255
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,870
Because you do listen.

256
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:31,220
You understand
what the people are going through.

257
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,750
Please.

258
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,630
Your people are waiting for you.

259
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:47,560
Let us now vote on Senator Burtoni's bill
to fund five million additional clones.

260
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,060
The opposition to this bill
must be allowed to speak first.

261
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,730
Unfortunately,
Senator Organa is nowhere to be found.

262
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,150
I will speak on his behalf.

263
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,160
Senator Amidala will be permitted
to speak.

264
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,910
Teckla Minnau...

265
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,170
Teckla is one of my aides.

266
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:22,090
Like so many of the people
that we tell ourselves we're here to serve,

267
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,430
Teckla lives in a district

268
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,810
that rarely has electricity and running
water as a result of the war.

269
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,940
Her children can now only bathe
every two weeks,

270
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,480
and they have no light
in which to read or study at night.

271
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,990
The Republic has always funded
these basic services,

272
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,030
but now, there are those who would divert
the money to the war,

273
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,830
with no thought for what
the people need to survive.

274
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:55,670
If not for people like
Teckla and her children,

275
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
who are we fighting for?

276
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,880
My people, your people, all of our people.

277
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:08,720
This war is meant to save them from
suffering, not increase it.

278
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,470
I support our brave soldiers,

279
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,060
whether they come from
the clone factories,

280
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,900
or from any of the thousands of systems
loyal to the Republic.

281
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,480
But if we continue
to impoverish our people,

282
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,150
it is not on the battlefield
where Dooku will defeat us,

283
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,870
but in our own homes.

284
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,740
Therefore, it is our duty

285
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,040
and our responsibility

286
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,050
to preserve the lives of those around us

287
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,840
by defeating this bill!

288
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,190
Well done, Padmé!

289
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,210
Isn't it remarkable that one can have
all the power in the galaxy,

290
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,050
and yet the words of a single senator

291
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,900
can sway the thoughts of millions?

292
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,810
What do you plan to do about this?

293
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,440
For now, we must adhere to the
principles of our democracy.

294
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,440
We must let the wheels of the Senate turn.
