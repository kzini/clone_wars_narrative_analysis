1
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,380
<i>Planet Ryloth invaded!</i>

2
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,984
<i>Subjected to a brutal
droid occupation,</i>

3
00:00:21,107 --> 00:00:22,693
<i>the people of Ryloth are starving</i>

4
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,686
<i>under the blockade
of a Separatist fleet.</i>

5
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,046
<i>Evil Separatist leader
Wat Tambor</i>

6
00:00:27,168 --> 00:00:29,203
<i>now rules with an iron fist.</i>

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,825
<i>Answering a plea from the Senate,
the Grand Army of the Republic</i>

8
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:35,348
<i>mounts a bold offensive
to liberate the system.</i>

9
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,033
<i>It is up to Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan Ahsoka</i>

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,555
<i>to make way
for Obi-Wan's ground assault.</i>

11
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:46,415
<i>Captain, are you prepared?</i>

12
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,496
Our blockade is impenetrable.

13
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,841
When the Republic attacks,

14
00:00:51,337 --> 00:00:54,436
they will get quite a surprise.

15
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,030
<i>I'm counting on you, Captain.</i>

16
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:01,636
<i>We cannot allow the Republic
to invade this planet.</i>

17
00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,852
Sir, we're coming out of Hyperspace.

18
00:01:13,852 --> 00:01:15,852
Prepare for battle, Raise the shields.

19
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:18,360
<i>All ships prepare for launch.</i>

20
00:01:20,505 --> 00:01:22,188
<i>All ships prepare for launch.</i>

21
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,742
This is my first time
commanding a squadron, R7.

22
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:30,406
Let's make a good impression.

23
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:32,431
Of course I'm not nervous

24
00:01:32,456 --> 00:01:35,956
Hey,Snips this is it, First command.
Dont be nervous

25
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,381
I wish everyone would stop saying that

26
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:41,206
Now you're commanding people are
depending on you with their lives.

27
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,731
Thanks, that takes the pressure off.
If I wasnt nervous before I sure am now.

28
00:01:46,956 --> 00:01:51,056
Hey, I have faith in you, I wouldn't send you out there
iIf I didn't think you could handle it.

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,810
May the Force be with you

30
00:01:54,835 --> 00:01:57,956
I won't let you down. I hope.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,121
OK, are you boys ready?

32
00:02:07,743 --> 00:02:09,810
This is Two Ax.
Ready when you are, skipper.

33
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:12,303
Ready on three.
This is Slava. Over.

34
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:15,133
Ready on four.
Kicked back, checking in.

35
00:02:15,228 --> 00:02:17,936
Soup to Blue leader.
Group Two is standing by. Over.

36
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:21,719
Taco on five.
Waiting for mother bird. Over.

37
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:40,456
Commander!  Yes Captain.
Launch all fighters.

38
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,179
Roger, roger.

39
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,663
- Tell Ahsoka the fleet is ready.
- Commander, you're all clear.

40
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:01,326
Thank you, Admiral.

41
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:14,304
Here we go.

42
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:33,237
<i>- Clear!
- I'm on it.</i>

43
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:38,394
<i>- Nice work!
- Two new targets closing!</i>

44
00:03:41,772 --> 00:03:45,706
That is General Skywalker's
flagship.

45
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:48,880
He is leading this attack.

46
00:03:49,448 --> 00:03:52,955
- Sir, their fighters are closing fast.
- Patience.

47
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,547
Let's see what trickery
the Jedi have planned for us.

48
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,986
We've got their fighters occupied.

49
00:04:02,886 --> 00:04:06,732
Ax, time for us to make a run
for the battleship.

50
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,969
Come on, you whiners.
Let's get dirty!

51
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:19,026
Sir, a squadron of fighters
are attacking.

52
00:04:25,446 --> 00:04:28,331
Battlecruiser 17, Battlecruiser 19,

53
00:04:28,576 --> 00:04:29,836
attack position!

54
00:04:34,142 --> 00:04:36,925
Admiral, four more enemy cruisers
have joined the blockade.

55
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,743
We've got to warn those fighters.

56
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,792
<i>Commander,
we've been caught in a trap!</i>

57
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,808
You're overreacting, Admiral.
I can get us through.

58
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:45,797
Blue Squadron, stay the course.

59
00:04:45,964 --> 00:04:47,422
We're all set, Blue Leader.

60
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:51,212
I'm ordering you to return to the ship.
We're going to need your help.

61
00:04:51,336 --> 00:04:53,002
Ahsoka, it's too risky.

62
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:55,209
<i>Get your pilots out of there.</i>

63
00:04:55,376 --> 00:04:57,583
Sir, we've got their fighters
surrounded.

64
00:04:57,751 --> 00:04:58,967
Good.

65
00:04:59,574 --> 00:05:01,609
She's not turning around.

66
00:05:05,552 --> 00:05:07,503
Ax, are you still there?

67
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:10,428
Got two on my tail.
I can't shake 'em!

68
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,560
I can't help you, Ax,
I've got my own problem.

69
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,515
- They're breaking our lines!
- Ahsoka, we are in trouble.

70
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,312
I order you back here.

71
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:28,818
All right, all right.

72
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:31,462
Let's go, squad.
Pull back to the command ship.

73
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:35,124
- Why are we retreating?
- We're not retreating. We're following orders.

74
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,865
Intensify deflector shields.

75
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:53,225
They're too many.
We can't shoot them all down!

76
00:05:53,388 --> 00:05:55,300
Fighter squadron, where are you?

77
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:57,333
- We're almost there.
- It's too late!

78
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,758
Run for it!

79
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,607
Admiral, come in.
Admiral!

80
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:09,455
- Hang on, Admiral.
- Get us out of here.

81
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:12,750
Get those fighters onboard
and prepare for lightspeed.

82
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:23,693
<i>All fighters return!
We're preparing for lightspeed.</i>

83
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,174
Right.
Ax, stand on it!

84
00:06:26,296 --> 00:06:28,858
We only have a few seconds
to get onboard.

85
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:30,729
Don't worry about me, skipper.

86
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:34,472
Captain, the Republic space forces
are in retreat.

87
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:35,855
Shall we pursue?

88
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,540
No.
Do not break our formation.

89
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,776
Let those cowards run.

90
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:44,356
My power converters,
they're failing!

91
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,065
Just stay with me, Ax.

92
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,176
Overload!

93
00:06:58,635 --> 00:06:59,449
Ax!

94
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:05,876
Close up the hangar doors.
We're home.

95
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,088
Jump to lightspeed.

96
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:27,005
Get your squad together.
I need a head count.

97
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:29,514
I need to know
how many we lost today.

98
00:07:34,171 --> 00:07:36,678
Ahsoka,
I am very disappointed in you.

99
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:40,062
You not only disobeyed the Admiral,
you disobeyed me.

100
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:41,873
I thought I could
knock out those battleships

101
00:07:41,972 --> 00:07:44,719
so when Master Obi-Wan arrived,
he could get through.

102
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:46,908
I know you meant well, Snips,

103
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,854
but there's a bigger picture
that you're not aware of.

104
00:07:49,973 --> 00:07:53,197
First rule of war,
listen and obey your superiors.

105
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,466
But sometimes <i>you</i> get carried away.

106
00:07:55,904 --> 00:07:58,929
All that means is that I understand
what you're going through.

107
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,437
- But I failed.
- It was a trap, Snips.

108
00:08:01,874 --> 00:08:03,148
It wasn't your fault.

109
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:05,696
I lost so many of my pilots.

110
00:08:06,412 --> 00:08:07,964
Take heart, little one.

111
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:10,074
That's the reality of command.

112
00:08:11,707 --> 00:08:13,657
General, we're approaching
our staging area.

113
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:14,930
Very good, Captain.

114
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,438
Master Windu is requesting
a report on our progress.

115
00:08:17,557 --> 00:08:18,632
Our progress, huh?

116
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:21,499
- We haven't made any progress yet.
- I'll tell him, sir.

117
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,767
No, Rex.
I'll tell him myself, thank you.

118
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:26,594
As soon as we tend to our wounded,
get me a damage report.

119
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:27,788
Right away, sir.

120
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,978
Snips, I'm gonna need you to...

121
00:08:34,673 --> 00:08:37,540
<i>Captain, what is the status
of the enemy attack?</i>

122
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,530
The Jedi were crushed, of course.

123
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,431
They fled the system,
their ships in flames.

124
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:47,372
I assure you, Admiral,
our blockade is very much intact.

125
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,555
<i>Congratulations
are in order, Captain.</i>

126
00:08:50,835 --> 00:08:52,904
<i>But do not underestimate the Jedi.</i>

127
00:08:54,298 --> 00:08:55,332
Commander,

128
00:08:55,492 --> 00:08:58,358
bring me the archive data
on General Skywalker.

129
00:08:58,477 --> 00:09:00,667
I need to learn more
about our opponent.

130
00:09:00,786 --> 00:09:01,781
Roger, roger.

131
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,119
They caught us by surprise, Master.

132
00:09:06,398 --> 00:09:09,384
- We were outnumbered.
- <i>How many men did you lose?</i>

133
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:11,692
We lost a cruiser, the Redeemer,

134
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,319
plus an entire squadron of fighters.

135
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:16,430
<i>And your Padawan?</i>

136
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:20,172
No, Ahsoka is fine.
She's just recovering from the battle.

137
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,077
Losing her squadron
was hard to take.

138
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:25,386
<i>Give her time.
But, Anakin,</i>

139
00:09:25,504 --> 00:09:28,092
<i>you will need her help
if you're going to get through this.</i>

140
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,166
I know.

141
00:09:29,286 --> 00:09:31,675
<i>Your forces have been
cut in half, Skywalker.</i>

142
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:35,495
<i>If you can't break that blockade
before the next planetary rotation,</i>

143
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,287
<i>we will have to postpone the invasion.</i>

144
00:09:37,446 --> 00:09:39,636
The Twi'leks on that planet can't
wait forever, Master.

145
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:42,462
The longer the Techno Union
keeps control of Ryloth,

146
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,730
the more difficult it'll be
to free them.

147
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,517
<i>I agree.
We don't have much time.</i>

148
00:09:50,463 --> 00:09:52,497
Rex, see if you can find Ahsoka.

149
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,195
He is stable for now.

150
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:05,725
Admiral, I am so sorry.

151
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,347
They're all gone.

152
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:14,353
Commander Ahsoka,
General Skywalker is looking for you.

153
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:21,760
No, R2, the other one.

154
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,364
Yeah, that's it.

155
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:26,522
This'll do it.

156
00:10:27,865 --> 00:10:29,858
You wanted to see me, Master?

157
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:31,201
Ahsoka.

158
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:33,236
Hand me that socket plug.

159
00:10:34,823 --> 00:10:35,801
Here.

160
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:38,365
Thanks, Snips.

161
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,034
How are you feeling?

162
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:43,208
Oh, I'm fine, Master.
Just fine.

163
00:10:43,574 --> 00:10:45,162
That's good to hear.

164
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:48,010
I'm gonna need you level-headed
if we're gonna pull this thing off.

165
00:10:48,173 --> 00:10:49,965
"Pull this off"?
Pull what off?

166
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:51,713
I talked to Master Windu.

167
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:54,359
We're to proceed
with our attack on the blockade.

168
00:10:54,522 --> 00:10:55,499
What?!

169
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:57,493
We can't!

170
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,993
Ahsoka,
we have to break that blockade.

171
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:03,639
The Twi'leks on Ryloth
are depending on us.

172
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:07,708
I understand that, Master,
but we've lost so many men.

173
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:10,028
- Did we get more support?
- No.

174
00:11:10,151 --> 00:11:12,633
We have to make do
with the forces we have.

175
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,377
- And I need to come up with a plan.
- You don't even have a plan?!

176
00:11:16,825 --> 00:11:18,370
Don't worry, Ahsoka.

177
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:19,593
No!

178
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:23,092
That's what you said last time,
and now everyone's gone!

179
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:25,025
- My whole squadron!
- Ahsoka!

180
00:11:25,046 --> 00:11:27,448
We can't just smash through
that blockade.

181
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:34,406
Skywalker here.

182
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:36,319
<i>General,
the Defender is contacting us.</i>

183
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:37,987
<i>There seems to be a problem.</i>

184
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,267
All right, Rex,
I'll be right there.

185
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:44,174
Go back to your quarters and cool off!
We'll finish this talk later.

186
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,930
Not a conventional Jedi,

187
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,901
to say the least,
it would seem.

188
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,953
- Commander!
- Yes, Captain?

189
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:08,594
Prepare all cannons and send
the droids to their battle stations.

190
00:12:08,674 --> 00:12:09,774
Yes, sir.

191
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,151
Captain, are we under attack?

192
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,994
No, but if Skywalker's record
indicates anything,

193
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,233
he'll be back.

194
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:28,739
Trooper, what's going on?

195
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,628
The starship Defender
is being evacuated, sir.

196
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,663
Evacuated?
Why?

197
00:12:33,826 --> 00:12:34,966
I'm not sure.

198
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,304
We're on our way
to help General Skywalker in the hangar.

199
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,843
All right, men, this way.
Come on, move it.

200
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,530
Move it! Let's go!
No time to waste!

201
00:12:51,692 --> 00:12:54,582
Master, I'm almost afraid to ask.

202
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,797
- I ordered the Defender evacuated.
- I can see that.

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,018
Why?

204
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:01,663
Well, actually,
I got the idea from you.

205
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,902
Oh, great.

206
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,612
Rex, take over, will you?

207
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:08,176
You said we couldn't
just smash through the blockade.

208
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:10,373
I decided that's partly true.

209
00:13:10,496 --> 00:13:13,426
You also implied that my plans
put a lot of people at risk

210
00:13:13,548 --> 00:13:16,640
- and I agree with you on that one.
- That's a first.

211
00:13:16,682 --> 00:13:18,798
I decided the only way
we can break the blockade

212
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:22,786
is if I pilot the Defender right into their
battleship and take out the commander.

213
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:26,287
- What?!
- This way I'm the only one at risk.

214
00:13:26,408 --> 00:13:28,891
Besides, the Defender
is damaged already.

215
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,619
You can't be serious, Master.

216
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,774
- You'll die!
- No, I won't.

217
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,078
That's where you come in.

218
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:38,008
The enemy can't stop that ship
from taking them out.

219
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:41,263
R2 and I will get in an escape pod
and jettison right before impact.

220
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,235
But the enemy fleet is right there!

221
00:13:44,398 --> 00:13:48,508
I know, and I'll pretty much be
defenseless in an escape pod,

222
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,947
so I'm depending on you
to engage the remaining fleet

223
00:13:52,048 --> 00:13:53,636
with the combined forces
we have here.

224
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,060
Master, I...

225
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,380
I can't.

226
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:00,982
If something goes wrong,
I can't be responsible for--

227
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:03,363
You <i>are</i> responsible, Ahsoka.

228
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:07,392
These men are depending on you,
and this time so am I.

229
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,712
But, Master, last time I--

230
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,463
Attention! Everyone!

231
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:12,846
Attention!

232
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,124
All right, men,
listen up.

233
00:14:15,248 --> 00:14:18,828
I'm taking over the Defender, and I'm
leaving Commander Ahsoka in charge.

234
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,599
She'll lead the second half
of the mission

235
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,142
when we engage
what's remaining of the blockade.

236
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,991
Commander Ahsoka will fill you in
on the full plan.

237
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,056
- Master, wait!
- Good luck.

238
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:29,188
Master!

239
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:31,533
Awaiting orders, Commander.

240
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:35,012
I'll be on the bridge.

241
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:38,894
Well, you heard her, boys.
Back to work!

242
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:40,754
Come on!
Move it! Move it!

243
00:14:50,884 --> 00:14:53,028
- Commander on deck.
- At ease.

244
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,720
General Skywalker is contacting you.

245
00:14:58,326 --> 00:15:00,873
<i>All right, Ahsoka,
we're ready to get under way.</i>

246
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:01,925
Master,

247
00:15:02,087 --> 00:15:04,270
are you sure
you won't reconsider this?

248
00:15:04,432 --> 00:15:06,535
<i>This is the only way,
trust me.</i>

249
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,429
Better fill us in, Commander.

250
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:13,248
Right.

251
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,274
<i>Count Dooku has assured me</i>

252
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:22,510
<i>the Republic forces
are stretched thin in our sector.</i>

253
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:25,988
<i>They should be unable
to mount a counterattack.</i>

254
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,940
<i>Any attempt to do so
would be suicide.</i>

255
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:33,429
Still, I am certain
this Skywalker will return.

256
00:15:34,035 --> 00:15:35,815
His ultimate defeat

257
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,807
shall be my greatest victory.

258
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,638
<i>You admire Skywalker?</i>

259
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:43,661
As a general, yes.

260
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:46,937
His record shows
he is a great warrior.

261
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:50,212
And I want him to know
it is I...

262
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,315
...who has beaten him.

263
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,885
I have to say
this plan is questionable.

264
00:15:57,047 --> 00:16:00,200
Yeah, but with their general destroyed
along with their battleship,

265
00:16:00,323 --> 00:16:02,506
the droid commanders
will be in chaos.

266
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,921
Only temporarily.

267
00:16:04,084 --> 00:16:06,794
And there's still General Skywalker
to find in all that mess.

268
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:08,027
I know, but--

269
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:11,404
In our first attack we had three
fully armed cruisers, and we failed.

270
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:14,679
I wish General Skywalker
had discussed this plan with us.

271
00:16:15,165 --> 00:16:17,267
The odds are very much against us.

272
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,805
They always are.

273
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:22,242
Yes, but normally we have
General Skywalker to lead us and...

274
00:16:24,466 --> 00:16:26,326
I meant no offense, Commander.

275
00:16:26,812 --> 00:16:27,823
None taken.

276
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:40,602
Sir, an enemy ship
is emerging from hyperspace.

277
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:43,231
I knew he'd return.

278
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,859
There is
an incoming transmission, sir.

279
00:16:46,992 --> 00:16:48,205
Put it through.

280
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:51,885
<i>Greetings, Captain.</i>

281
00:16:52,006 --> 00:16:54,636
<i>I'm Anakin Skywalker,
general of the Grand Army...</i>

282
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,709
I know who you are, Skywalker.

283
00:16:58,357 --> 00:17:00,459
<i>Well, my reputation precedes me, then.</i>

284
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,319
<i>I've been ordered
to surrender myself,</i>

285
00:17:02,441 --> 00:17:04,625
<i>the entire crew of this vessel
and my ship</i>

286
00:17:04,746 --> 00:17:07,092
<i>in exchange for safe passage of food</i>

287
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:09,761
<i>and medical supplies
to the people of Ryloth.</i>

288
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:11,928
A noble gesture, Jedi.

289
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,012
And your capture

290
00:17:14,131 --> 00:17:17,159
would make me
the envy of the Separatist fleet.

291
00:17:18,379 --> 00:17:22,311
Sir, even if Skywalker is successful
and destroys the battleship,

292
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:26,481
how will we stand up to the combined
firepower of the remaining frigates?

293
00:17:27,384 --> 00:17:31,553
I thought about that
and, well, I have an idea.

294
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:33,087
Go ahead, Commander.

295
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:37,335
If we took the Resolute and angled
her hull against the incoming frigates,

296
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:41,268
the bridge and hangar deck would be
relatively safe from their attack.

297
00:17:41,386 --> 00:17:44,925
We could draw them in and then
use the bombers to outflank them.

298
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:48,111
The bombers would be too fast,
and they would be trapped.

299
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:49,763
I'm not sure about this, Commander.

300
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,864
I think...

301
00:17:51,022 --> 00:17:53,420
If we were certain
the shields would hold...

302
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,882
Perhaps a different strategy.
We need to take more time and plan.

303
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:00,343
No!
We don't have any more time!

304
00:18:00,697 --> 00:18:03,017
Master Skywalker needs me now!

305
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,377
He needs us now.

306
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,619
The Commander is right.

307
00:18:08,642 --> 00:18:10,725
I know this strategy is very bold,

308
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,029
but these circumstances
call for drastic measures.

309
00:18:14,108 --> 00:18:16,231
Then, the strategy will work, sir?

310
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:18,277
Well, will it?

311
00:18:19,535 --> 00:18:21,266
Yes, it will.

312
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,756
We have completed the scan
of the enemy ship.

313
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:28,818
And?

314
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,862
The ship is heavily damaged.

315
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,419
All power is diverted
to the forward shields.

316
00:18:33,536 --> 00:18:35,463
There is only one life-form onboard.

317
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,784
- What?!
- The ship is heavily damaged.

318
00:18:37,902 --> 00:18:40,419
- All power is--
- No, you insolent scrub!

319
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,251
Skywalker, what treachery is this?

320
00:18:43,605 --> 00:18:45,650
You have nothing to bargain with.

321
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,010
<i>In that case, I'll be going.</i>

322
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:50,489
<i>You can still have my ship.</i>

323
00:18:51,597 --> 00:18:52,704
Uh, sir...

324
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,764
there's a second Republic ship
entering the system.

325
00:18:56,326 --> 00:18:57,212
She made it!

326
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,950
Boost the engines
and let's get outta here.

327
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,169
When those two ships collide,
there'll be chaos.

328
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:10,377
We need that time

329
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,275
to get General Skywalker's pod
into the tractor beam.

330
00:19:13,637 --> 00:19:14,966
Right, Commander.

331
00:19:16,173 --> 00:19:17,664
I'll man the fighter squadron.

332
00:19:17,785 --> 00:19:19,797
Wait for my signal
to begin our attack.

333
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,924
Yes, sir.

334
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,198
All cannons, fire!
Fire!

335
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,691
We can't stop it!

336
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:44,595
- What should we do?
- You stay here. I'll be back.

337
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,126
That's great.

338
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,224
See, I told you
it would work.

339
00:19:55,385 --> 00:19:58,123
<i>We're approaching your position.
Stand by for retrieval.</i>

340
00:19:58,244 --> 00:19:59,492
Right on time, Ahsoka.

341
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:10,401
I don't think
they're going to attack, Commander.

342
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:12,978
- <i>We'll have to retreat.</i>
- No! Wait!

343
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:15,515
Remember, they are droids.

344
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,285
They're just a little slow.

345
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,016
They'll figure it out.

346
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:21,594
I think the Captain left.

347
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:24,693
<i>- Who's in charge?
- Not me.</i>

348
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:28,357
- <i>What should we do?</i>
- Begin attack.

349
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:39,066
The droids are attacking, sir.

350
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,044
Commander, on your order,
commence flanking manoeuvre.

351
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,262
OK, boys, here we go.

352
00:20:44,382 --> 00:20:45,633
Follow my lead.

353
00:21:01,922 --> 00:21:04,342
<i>- We've been outflanked!
- Affirmative!</i>

354
00:21:06,318 --> 00:21:07,608
That-a girl, Ahsoka.

355
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,253
<i>Where is the Captain?
What is going on?</i>

356
00:21:18,495 --> 00:21:20,390
He's in an escape pod.

357
00:21:20,631 --> 00:21:23,132
<i>Idiots!
The blockade has been broken!</i>

358
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:26,599
Where are those escape pods?

359
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:31,599
<i>Commander, the invasion fleet
is coming out of hyperspace.</i>

360
00:21:33,816 --> 00:21:35,471
Ahsoka, this is Obi-Wan.

361
00:21:35,631 --> 00:21:37,124
May we begin our landing?

362
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,107
Yes, Master.
You're cleared for ground assault.

363
00:21:40,308 --> 00:21:42,930
I won't even ask
where the rest of Anakin's fleet is,

364
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,550
or why he's in an escape pod.

365
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:48,211
That's probably for the best.

366
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:50,106
Rex, that reminds me,

367
00:21:50,228 --> 00:21:52,606
send a shuttle
to pick up Master Skywalker.

368
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:07,606
<i>General, are you still there?</i>

369
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,791
Yep. I'm just sitting here
watching the show.
