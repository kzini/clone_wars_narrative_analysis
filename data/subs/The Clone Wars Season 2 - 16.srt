1
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,200
An impenetrable defense.

2
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,679
Separatist ships blockade
the resource-rich planet of Christophsis,

3
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,879
trapping Senator Bail Organa
and his relief effort.

4
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,959
Desperate to aid the esteemed Senator,

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,918
a Republic task force under the command
of Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker

6
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,797
must break the impasse.

7
00:00:32,918 --> 00:00:37,477
But time runs short for the Senator
and the good citizens of Christophsis.

8
00:00:41,197 --> 00:00:43,156
Separatist forces
have overrun our position

9
00:00:45,436 --> 00:00:47,795
and we are out of food,
water and munitions.

10
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,554
Our situation is desperate.

11
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:50,835
Senator Organa?

12
00:00:50,915 --> 00:00:52,434
Senator Organa!

13
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,753
General, another cruiser's been hit.

14
00:00:54,835 --> 00:00:56,673
Master Kenobi better get here soon

15
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:59,193
or this is gonna be
one short rescue mission.

16
00:01:04,353 --> 00:01:06,391
The command ship is bearing down on us!

17
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:16,310
Full forward shields! Incoming fire!

18
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,749
This isn't gonna be easy.

19
00:01:26,388 --> 00:01:32,747
Fire all forward cannons,
cut off those Republic supply ships,

20
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,107
separate them from their escort cruisers.

21
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,425
I smell fear

22
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:42,585
and it smells good.

23
00:01:49,864 --> 00:01:52,183
General, one of the supply ships
has been hit.

24
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:54,023
Over-fire all reactors.

25
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,142
We're gonna blow right past this guy,
whoever he is.

26
00:01:59,423 --> 00:02:02,061
General, a Republic cruiser is
coming out of hyperspace behind us.

27
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:04,261
Obi-Wan.

28
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:12,219
Looks like General Skywalker's
already engaged the enemy.

29
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:13,979
That's nothing out of the ordinary.

30
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:16,539
Especially since I gave him
a direct order not to.

31
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:24,498
The Republic ship
is not breaking off its attack.

32
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:29,056
Hold the line. Intensify forward deflectors.

33
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:40,135
- Anakin, I want you to withdraw.
- Withdraw?

34
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,694
I brought a new toy
that might give us an advantage.

35
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,174
With respect, General,
now might not be a bad time to regroup.

36
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:52,092
Tell the transports
to fall back to Obi-Wan's position,

37
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,972
we'll cover their retreat
as they escape behind the moon.

38
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:57,772
I don't like this.
I hope Obi-Wan knows what he's doing.

39
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:18,768
They are escaping.
Should we go after them?

40
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:23,766
No! Our orders are to blockade, not chase.

41
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:26,607
I have won this round.

42
00:03:34,966 --> 00:03:38,965
And the enemy will soon return.
And when they do,

43
00:03:40,125 --> 00:03:41,364
we shall be ready.

44
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,599
Well, here I am.
Tell me about this new weapon.

45
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,318
- You're looking at it.
- I'm looking at what?

46
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,597
Two steps forward
and you'd actually be kissing it.

47
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:25,356
It's a stealth ship.

48
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:33,634
- Hmm. That's some trick.
- Let's hope the Separatists think so.

49
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:35,914
So I assume scanners can't detect it?

50
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:39,513
As far as we know,
but this is the first real field test.

51
00:04:39,594 --> 00:04:42,833
- That's encouraging.
- I figured you'd be up to the challenge.

52
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:47,951
So, I can move in undetected
and take them out from behind.

53
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:51,951
It's a pretty small ship
to destroy a whole fleet. Are there more?

54
00:04:52,072 --> 00:04:55,591
No, this is the prototype,
and you won't be on the offensive.

55
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,470
I need you to run a mercy mission
down to the planet's surface.

56
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,669
The ship can carry enough supplies
for Senator Organa's headquarters.

57
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,829
Oh, I'm still the delivery boy?

58
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,508
We don't need the whole fleet.
I can do this myself.

59
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,828
Anakin, slow down and do what I tell you.

60
00:05:09,869 --> 00:05:12,748
It's more important to save lives
than destroy ships.

61
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:14,627
I need you to continue the mercy mission.

62
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:34,303
Impossible, it can't be him.

63
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,583
Tell General Skywalker
to hold his departure.

64
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:37,943
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,141
Thank you for waiting, sir.
I'm sorry to hold you up.

66
00:05:51,262 --> 00:05:53,540
No apologies, Admiral. What have you got?

67
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:57,580
Something about this morning's
engagement struck me as familiar,

68
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,619
- so I did a bit of research.
- And?

69
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,538
I believe the opposing commander
is none other than Admiral Trench.

70
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:08,097
If I remember my military history,

71
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:10,977
wasn't he vaporized
at the Battle of Malastare Narrows?

72
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:12,617
That's what I thought, too.

73
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:16,056
But the tactics employed,
the efficiency of the droids' maneuvers,

74
00:06:16,857 --> 00:06:18,376
and then there's this.

75
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,735
The last time I saw that symbol,

76
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,575
well, let's just say
I lost a lot of good men that day.

77
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,934
What do I need to know?

78
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:29,214
I have seen his work firsthand.

79
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:33,972
A corporate fleet was blockading
Malastare, a fleet led by Trench.

80
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:37,212
That's why I recognized the tactics.

81
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:41,371
He tore our ships apart.
We barely escaped with our lives.

82
00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:45,851
In the end, a Jedi-led task force moved in
to settle the matter.

83
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:50,250
Trench's ship was destroyed
and we assumed he went down with it.

84
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,969
- Hmm. Are you sure it's him?
- It's possible.

85
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,529
Not every captain goes down with his ship.

86
00:06:56,609 --> 00:06:59,608
Well, we may be in luck then, Admiral,

87
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:04,807
my orders are not to engage Trench,
just to deliver supplies to Senator Organa.

88
00:07:04,888 --> 00:07:06,607
With all due respect, General,

89
00:07:06,688 --> 00:07:09,167
I do not believe
we will have a choice in the matter.

90
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:13,045
If it is indeed Trench, he will come for us.

91
00:07:13,846 --> 00:07:15,845
- Us?
- Yes.

92
00:07:15,926 --> 00:07:19,325
I'm volunteering my services
as consultant, General.

93
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,604
Welcome aboard.

94
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:24,244
Hurry up, rookie, we're leaving.

95
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:28,203
CT1284, Spark reporting for duty, sir.

96
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:32,203
We lost one of our starting lineup, kid.
You ready to step up and take his place?

97
00:07:32,283 --> 00:07:33,882
Yes, sir, just show me my station.

98
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:37,841
You'll be sitting right across from me,

99
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:41,680
where I can keep an eye on you
until you're up to speed.

100
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,080
Everyone's onboard, we are go.

101
00:07:44,161 --> 00:07:46,680
Dispatch, we are powering up
and ready to go.

102
00:08:00,198 --> 00:08:02,877
- Going silent in 10.
Systems green.

103
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:05,276
Power core steady, pick up
your scanning five targets...

104
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:08,555
- Engage cloaking device.
- ... and 12-1-5.

105
00:08:40,471 --> 00:08:42,390
Doesn't look like they can detect us.

106
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,429
Yes, but if you get any closer they may
not need scanners to know we're here.

107
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:49,588
Relax, Admiral.
Hey, you wanted to come on this ride.

108
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:57,786
I cannot calculate why the Republic fleet
has not launched another attack?

109
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:02,946
What is the status
of the assault on Christophsis?

110
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,986
Resistance is crumbling, sir,

111
00:09:05,106 --> 00:09:07,825
I would estimate a half rotation
before it is over.

112
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:11,264
We need to add some pressure

113
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:16,824
on those who were sent to rescue
our enemies on Christophsis.

114
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,423
Hmm.

115
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:26,262
Send the Hyena bombers
to hit Senator Organa on the surface.

116
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:31,901
That should draw those cowards out
from behind the moon.

117
00:09:50,539 --> 00:09:53,297
General, we have incoming bombers
with fighter escort.

118
00:09:58,577 --> 00:10:02,855
Enemy ships closing,
15,000, 14,000, 13,000...

119
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,974
What's our defensive capability?

120
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:07,255
We've got torpedoes
and anti-aircraft cannons, sir,

121
00:10:07,375 --> 00:10:09,134
but we'd have to de-cloak to use either.

122
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:10,814
Yeah, and if they don't know we're here

123
00:10:10,894 --> 00:10:12,853
that would give our position away
pretty quickly.

124
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:19,213
...9,000, 8,000...

125
00:10:19,253 --> 00:10:21,772
- Have they detected us?
- Can't tell, sir.

126
00:10:21,852 --> 00:10:24,731
If we are going on the offensive
we must do it soon!

127
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,691
...5,000, 4,000...

128
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:32,010
Stay cloaked, power everything else down,
let her drift.

129
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,009
...2,000,

130
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,528
1,000...

131
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,128
- They're going to hit us!
- Five hundred!

132
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,525
They missed us.
They don't know we're here.

133
00:10:56,607 --> 00:10:58,645
They're heading for Bail Organa
and the command center.

134
00:10:58,726 --> 00:10:59,765
They're going to bomb it!

135
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:03,925
Sir, we have incoming bombers!

136
00:11:09,604 --> 00:11:11,083
Get me General Kenobi!

137
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:14,002
We are under attack
by the Separatist fleet.

138
00:11:14,083 --> 00:11:16,322
They're coming by air and by ground.

139
00:11:16,403 --> 00:11:19,522
We can't hold out any longer.
There's little chance for survival.

140
00:11:19,602 --> 00:11:22,121
Help us, General Kenobi,
you're our only hope.

141
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,761
Get me Anakin.

142
00:11:25,921 --> 00:11:28,120
Anakin, I've just spoken to the Senator,

143
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,080
they're in dire need of our help.

144
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,279
Continue with your mission
to the planet's surface.

145
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,279
I will engage Trench's fleet
with the ships I already have.

146
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,918
General Kenobi, with all due respect,

147
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,918
you do not have the resources
to engage Trench openly.

148
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:42,558
He wants you to attack,
you'll be walking into a trap.

149
00:11:42,638 --> 00:11:45,797
He's right, Master,
you won't stand a chance.

150
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:49,276
Anakin, I've got enough problems
without you becoming one of them.

151
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:52,396
Get those supplies to the refugee camp.
I'll worry about Trench.

152
00:11:52,476 --> 00:11:55,995
- Just stay on course and...
- Your tactic won't work.

153
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:59,834
Prep torpedo tubes one through four.
Fix range on Trench's command ship.

154
00:11:59,915 --> 00:12:02,234
- Sir?
- You heard me, Admiral.

155
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:05,873
- What are you doing?
- We need to destroy Trench,

156
00:12:05,954 --> 00:12:08,112
and this ship
has the best chance of doing that.

157
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:12,832
- I want those supplies on the surface now.
- Don't worry, I'm on it.

158
00:12:13,673 --> 00:12:14,672
Anakin!

159
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,911
The Republic fleet is holding position.

160
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:21,750
This is unusual.

161
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,669
What can they be planning?

162
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:36,308
Prepare to de-cloak on my command.

163
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:39,667
Prep torpedo tubes one through four.
Fix range on Trench's command ship.

164
00:12:39,788 --> 00:12:41,706
I thought we were on a relief mission.

165
00:12:41,748 --> 00:12:44,386
You'll learn pretty quick that
when you serve under General Skywalker

166
00:12:44,467 --> 00:12:47,786
you're always on the offensive.
Now get ready to cycle those shields.

167
00:12:47,827 --> 00:12:50,265
You realize
our torpedoes may not be enough.

168
00:12:50,346 --> 00:12:54,265
All I want is for Trench to think about us
instead of the people on the planet below.

169
00:12:54,945 --> 00:12:57,104
It's time to introduce ourselves.

170
00:12:58,464 --> 00:13:01,263
Activate the turbo chargers.
Release torpedo safety!

171
00:13:02,384 --> 00:13:06,063
- Ready to divert power!
- Shield regeneration on standby.

172
00:13:08,743 --> 00:13:10,781
Hmm.

173
00:13:10,863 --> 00:13:15,421
Something odd is going on out there.

174
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,620
Ready torpedoes,
lock onto primary target.

175
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,099
Disengage cloaking device.

176
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,058
There! A cloaked ship!

177
00:13:34,418 --> 00:13:35,497
Fire!

178
00:13:38,937 --> 00:13:41,496
- Torpedoes locked and closing.
- Activate the shields.

179
00:13:48,816 --> 00:13:51,055
Foolish Republic scum.

180
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:55,974
Your puny torpedoes
are no match for my thermo-shields.

181
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:58,653
Prepare to fire all cannons!

182
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:02,052
Well, that did little good.

183
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,931
- Re-cloaking in nine, eight...
- Fire!

184
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:08,571
...six, five...

185
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,610
- Pilot, prep the flares.
- Too late, General!

186
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,010
Launch flares!

187
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:19,049
And cloak!

188
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,288
Fire a spread of lasers.

189
00:14:33,047 --> 00:14:34,846
- Incoming!
- I see it.

190
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:56,723
Scans are coming up negative. We missed.

191
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,042
Yes,

192
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:01,601
but we have learned something.

193
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:07,001
No clone could successfully fly
through that many lasers.

194
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:10,960
We are dealing with a Jedi.

195
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:16,119
Patch me into the com channel,
open frequency.

196
00:15:23,918 --> 00:15:25,037
What you got, Spark?

197
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:27,997
There's an open communication signal
coming from the enemy.

198
00:15:28,118 --> 00:15:29,477
Better tell the General.

199
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:32,796
Now that they know we are here,
what's your plan?

200
00:15:33,717 --> 00:15:35,636
I'll think of something, Admiral.
In the meantime,

201
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:38,835
I've got Trench right where I want him,
thinking about us.

202
00:15:38,956 --> 00:15:42,395
General, there's a transmission
on the open frequency, it's the enemy.

203
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:43,954
Put it through.

204
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,833
Hello, ugly.

205
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:51,632
I am Admiral Trench.

206
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:56,592
If you are listening, Jedi,
you've made a bold move

207
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,671
and a grave mistake.

208
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:05,510
I appreciate your decision to face me,
ship to ship, to play this little game.

209
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:10,349
It's been so long
since I had a worthy opponent.

210
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,548
You have an impressive new vessel,

211
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,907
but I warn you,
I have dealt with its kind before.

212
00:16:19,628 --> 00:16:22,387
Your technology will not save you.

213
00:16:22,508 --> 00:16:28,586
And your friends on the planet below
shall perish as a result of your failure.

214
00:16:29,707 --> 00:16:33,146
The people of Christophsis
and her resources

215
00:16:34,506 --> 00:16:37,904
shall join the Separatist Alliance.

216
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:41,584
Turn back now, retreat while you can,

217
00:16:41,704 --> 00:16:45,703
for I am your doom.

218
00:16:48,464 --> 00:16:51,142
He said he's dealt
with this kind of ship before.

219
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:53,022
How?

220
00:16:53,103 --> 00:16:57,261
I calculate the Jedi will not turn back
as you request, Admiral.

221
00:16:59,062 --> 00:17:02,260
Of course not. I do not expect him to.

222
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:08,859
He'll attack again. A stealth ship
could have passed our blockade easily,

223
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,898
this Jedi chose to attack.

224
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,737
You were right, Admiral,

225
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:17,777
there are records of Trench's battles and
a few against ships with cloaking devices.

226
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,657
- And?
- It seems, in each case,

227
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,057
he used tracking torpedoes
to hit the ship somehow

228
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:23,816
whether it was cloaked or not.

229
00:17:23,897 --> 00:17:25,896
Then he knows a way of detecting us.

230
00:17:25,976 --> 00:17:28,256
Tracking torpedoes? Hmm.

231
00:17:28,296 --> 00:17:29,815
What class ship was he fighting?

232
00:17:29,856 --> 00:17:32,814
Mostly cruiser to cruiser,
nothing as small as your ship.

233
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,134
Well, no ship this small
usually has a cloaking device.

234
00:17:36,215 --> 00:17:39,533
Maybe he's tracking
the magnetic signature...

235
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:43,213
Thanks, Obi-Wan. Hold off your attack
until we destroy Trench.

236
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:46,132
Might I remind you
that this was not your mission?

237
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:47,252
You might.

238
00:17:47,293 --> 00:17:50,332
Admiral, prepare to disengage
cloaking device and fire.

239
00:17:52,052 --> 00:17:53,171
Battle stations!

240
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:55,730
- Engineering, check.
- Navigation, check.

241
00:17:56,491 --> 00:17:58,330
- Guns, check.
- Torpedoes, check.

242
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,809
- Shields, check.
- Admiral, we are ready and waiting.

243
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,609
Your move, General.

244
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,689
Fire!

245
00:18:11,768 --> 00:18:13,007
There she is!

246
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,767
Re-cloaking in five, four...

247
00:18:16,287 --> 00:18:19,646
Sir, four more Republic torpedoes
armed and closing.

248
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:25,205
Lock us onto that ship's
magnetic signature.

249
00:18:30,405 --> 00:18:32,443
Magnetic signature locked.

250
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:36,603
Arm tracking torpedoes
and fire on my command.

251
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:41,122
But, sir, we cannot fire
unless we lower our shields.

252
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,682
Lower shields and fire!

253
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,401
Lowering shields.

254
00:18:50,082 --> 00:18:52,920
General, I really hope
you know what you're doing.

255
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,200
So do I, Admiral.

256
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,718
They are turning around.

257
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,998
General, the cloaking device is active,

258
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,557
but they're locked onto
our magnetic signature.

259
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:10,197
He took the bait.
Turn off the cloaking device,

260
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,116
divert all power to the engines.

261
00:19:18,637 --> 00:19:23,314
He is headed right for us.
- He can't! Raise the shields!

262
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:26,114
We cannot, the shields are still recharging.

263
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,790
- That's the way! Yes!
- We did it!

264
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:50,510
- We made it!
- Good job!

265
00:19:50,871 --> 00:19:54,069
I hate to admit it, but good job, Anakin.

266
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,629
We're beginning our attack
on the Separatist fleet.

267
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,708
Have fun. I'll be delivering the supplies
to the surface, Master.

268
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:16,105
General Skywalker,
I have no idea how you did it,

269
00:20:16,226 --> 00:20:18,145
but you saved a great many lives today.

270
00:20:18,865 --> 00:20:21,344
Good job, kid. Looks like you're now

271
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,744
- officially part of the crew.
- Thanks, Commander.

272
00:20:25,665 --> 00:20:28,023
Well, looks like we make
a pretty good team.

273
00:20:28,064 --> 00:20:32,902
I must admit, I am a bit surprised
at the reckless nature of your tactics,

274
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,422
though I cannot argue with their results.

275
00:20:35,462 --> 00:20:39,741
Well, you'll find
I like to do things, uh,

276
00:20:39,782 --> 00:20:41,940
differently from time to time.

277
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,860
Indeed, the Chancellor mentioned as much,

278
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,700
though he insisted
it was the highest compliment.
