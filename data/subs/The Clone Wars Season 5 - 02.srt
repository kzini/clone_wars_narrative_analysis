1
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,700
<i>Separatist takeover complete.</i>

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,260
<i>Another Republic planet has fallen.</i>

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,600
<i>Onderon has seceded</i>

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:27,200
<i>to the Confederacy
of Independent Systems</i>

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:29,470
<i>under the rule of a new king.</i>

6
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,310
<i>However, a small band of rebels
have taken refuge</i>

7
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,550
<i>deep within its vast
and savage wilderness.</i>

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,280
<i>From an abandoned outpost,
they plot to take back</i>

9
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>the heavily fortified
capital city of Iziz</i>

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:43,480
<i>and end the Separatist occupation.</i>

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,190
<i>Unfortunately,
the only way to reclaim Onderon</i>

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,030
<i>will be through armed struggle.</i>

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,600
<i>But we lack sufficient
hardware and supplies.</i>

14
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,600
Onderon is in your king's rule.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,940
And at the outbreak of the Clone War,

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,200
he chose to align it
with the Separatists.

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,240
<i>Our true king has been silenced.</i>

18
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,950
<i>The one you recognize is a traitor</i>

19
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,240
<i>and a Separatist minion.</i>

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,310
<i>We need your help to survive this.</i>

21
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,750
Find a way we shall.

22
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,790
<i>We await your answer.</i>

23
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,030
There are pockets of rebels
on many of these planets

24
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,520
that just need guidance.

25
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,290
With training and resources,

26
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,330
they could attack soft targets
while the Republic

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,560
continues to engage them
on the battlefield.

28
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,270
That sounds like terrorism, Anakin.

29
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,950
Well, I think of it as an insurgency

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,940
to help realign these planets
with the Republic.

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,940
We can divide the Separatist forces

32
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,540
and press them on two fronts.

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:44,980
A means to an end fear cannot be.

34
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,080
Stop those who spread terror
the Jedi must.

35
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,127
Indeed.

36
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,350
What you're suggesting

37
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,120
would open up dangerous possibilities.

38
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,290
And we must not train terrorists.

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,930
Eh, rebels.

40
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,136
How we conduct war

41
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,370
is what distinguishes us from others.

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,030
Funding rebels to overthrow
a legitimate government

43
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,930
puts innocent lives at risk.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,440
We can minimize collateral damage

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,970
by using arms
that mainly affect droids.

46
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,810
The least we can do
is help them defend themselves,

47
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,050
test the tactic while we're at it.

48
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,350
This could be
a great new weapon for us.

49
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,520
Hmm.

50
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,720
Train and observe.

51
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,960
Send advisors we will.

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,570
I'll assemble a team.

53
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,830
I'm going with you.

54
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,940
What, you don't trust me?

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,200
Too much.

56
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,270
That's what worries me.

57
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,810
This is Valkyrie 2929.

58
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,480
We're coming up on the drop zone.

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,470
Go, go, go, go!

60
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
We've spotted them, sir.

61
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,700
Stay where you are.

62
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,170
Identify yourselves.

63
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,720
It's all right. We're friends.

64
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,510
Jedi.

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,720
I'm Commander Tano.

66
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,080
We're here to help you
take back your planet.

67
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,220
My name is Steela.

68
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,960
I'll guide you to our secret base.

69
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,420
Hmm.

70
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,230
A bit rough around the edges,
wouldn't you say?

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,040
That's why I brought Rex here.

72
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,130
They're not exactly
what I would call shinies, sir,

73
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
but I could work with them.

74
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,850
General Skywalker.

75
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,550
At your service.

76
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,350
This is General Kenobi,

77
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,120
Commander Tano, and Captain Rex.

78
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,060
We're looking forward
to taking the fight

79
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,930
to those scrappin' droids.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,830
Yes. All in good time.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,170
Saw.

82
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,710
Saw Gerrera.

83
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,840
He fashions himself as our leader,

84
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:09,010
though no one elected him.

85
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,180
Well, for now, we're in charge,

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,220
and there is much to learn.

87
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,850
The Separatists
have strength in numbers.

88
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,990
We're gonna show you
how to target and destroy them.

89
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,060
Now, to be clear,

90
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,030
we are not here to fight your war;

91
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,830
Rather, to show you how to conduct it

92
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,870
in the most efficient
and successful way possible.

93
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,900
Captain Rex.

94
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,670
I'll show you
how the 501st destroy clankers.

95
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,740
First, I need volunteers
to carry supplies

96
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,510
from our entry point
a half-klick west.

97
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,380
Shouldn't be a problem.

98
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,780
Excellent.

99
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,290
Lux, it's good to see you again.

100
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,490
It's good to see you too, Ahsoka.

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,600
I didn't realize you had
such strong ties to Onderon.

102
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,360
Onderon is my home.

103
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,830
My mother represented it
in the Senate.

104
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,500
Your voice is strong, like hers was.

105
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,540
Have you reconsidered
joining the Republic Senate?

106
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,810
Even if we do take back Onderon,

107
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,710
it won't change how I feel.

108
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm not fighting for the Republic.

109
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,150
Well, what matters now is,
we need each other's help,

110
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,350
just like we did on Carlac.

111
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,320
Carlac?

112
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:25,990
What happened on Carlac?

113
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,590
Ahsoka is the reason I'm here
and not with Death Watch.

114
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,090
Really?

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,660
What he means is...

116
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,430
She saved me from a huge mistake.

117
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,200
Hmm.

118
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,540
Lux obviously thinks highly of you.

119
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,750
I guess so.

120
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,840
Let's hope that respect
is well founded.

121
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,900
The pilot in the front hatch
controls the tank,

122
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,360
the shelves and the short range blasters.

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,256
The commander in the top hatch
controls the turret

124
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,010
and the main cannon.

125
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,880
You have to take out both chambers.

126
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,780
Otherwise, the tank
will remain operational.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone, divide up into teams of two,

128
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,240
and we'll practice an assault
on both hatches.

129
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,840
I'll take the top.

130
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,980
Let's see what you're
made of, Bonteri.

131
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,260
Ah!

132
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,630
Sorry about that.

133
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,660
You're a terrible soldier, Bonteri.

134
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,830
I'm not sure
if they're more interested

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
in fighting the droids or each other.

136
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,140
They'll learn.

137
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,480
We just need time
to train them properly.

138
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,440
Keep your eyes on the quick learners.

139
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:02,180
In this fight,
time is not on our side.

140
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,090
Go, go, go, go, go!

141
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,970
An unscheduled ship
entered the atmosphere

142
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,210
in sector S-11

143
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,310
and failed to register.

144
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,310
The rebels may be operating
in that area.

145
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,380
Check it out.

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,500
Come on!

147
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Move it like a soldier,
like a real soldier!

148
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,460
Come on, Dono.
Pick it up, Hutch.

149
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,990
You can do better than that.

150
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,430
Come on, hustle!

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,000
I said hustle!

152
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,700
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

153
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,900
Go, go, go!

154
00:09:58,970 --> 00:09:59,970
Good, good.

155
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,210
You sure you're up for this?

156
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:03,100
- Saw.
- It was an accident.

157
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:06,970
You would've had us both killed.

158
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,340
Just stop it.

159
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,810
Sit down, boy.

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,150
This isn't the Senate.

161
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,060
You've got no talent for this.

162
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,720
It's going to take
a lot more than muscle

163
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,690
to defeat the Separatists.

164
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,020
Politics have failed us.
We have no choice.

165
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,960
We always have a choice.

166
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,370
Then make yours.

167
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,260
Look, if we're going to succeed,

168
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,470
you'll need to be exceptional
with words and action.

169
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,500
There will be time for both.

170
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,520
Destroyers are quick,
pack twin blasters,

171
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,410
and come with their own
shield generators.

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,380
Nothing short of a cannon
will pierce it.

173
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,750
But they do have two weaknesses,

174
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,890
and you will need to work
together to exploit them.

175
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,190
Beep!

176
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,690
The shields deflect
high-velocity attacks.

177
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,400
What the shields don't stop
are slow or stationary objects.

178
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,676
They're designed to absorb them

179
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,440
so nothing hinders their movement.

180
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,880
Destroyers are blind from behind.

181
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,150
A distraction combined
with a rear assault

182
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,650
will give you a kill.

183
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
The trick is to get the right
speed on the droid popper.

184
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:28,790
Beep!

185
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,030
These are unarmed.

186
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,330
Just concentrate on getting it
past the shield.

187
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,430
Watch and learn.

188
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,480
Quite brilliant.

189
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,120
Hmm. Nice touch.

190
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,190
Thanks.

191
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,090
Not bad.

192
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,900
Ugh!

193
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,970
Be mindful of your frustration.

194
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,840
It'll only hold you back.

195
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,040
Here.

196
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,240
Use your shoulder, let your arm swing,

197
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,950
and keep your eyes on the target.

198
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,050
Great.

199
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,790
Okay, let's get back to work.

200
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,190
Everyone pair up.

201
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,230
We'll practice in groups.

202
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,030
Hey, Commander,
how about helping me practice?

203
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,490
Roger, roger. This is command.

204
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,190
Copy that.
I'll send a squad out now.

205
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,660
We've located the rebels.

206
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,030
Proceed to sector S-29.

207
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,070
Shoot to kill.

208
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,970
I can't get the distance
or the speed right.

209
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,440
Don't give up.

210
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,650
Learning this could save your
life and those around you.

211
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,410
A little backspin might help.

212
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,050
Just take it easy.

213
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
Don't get frustrated.

214
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,290
You got it.

215
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,490
You're a good teacher, Jedi.

216
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,130
Ugh, just forget it.

217
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,170
I'll never learn this.

218
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,500
Uh, keep practicing.

219
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,420
You made it look easy.

220
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,950
It wasn't always that way.

221
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,590
Right. The Force.

222
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,690
That your secret?

223
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,860
No. Perseverance.

224
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,730
Look, you'll get the hang of it.

225
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,460
I wouldn't let it get you down.

226
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm not feeling down.

227
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,870
I just know what I'm good at.

228
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,360
Impressive.

229
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,460
Most impressive.

230
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,230
Fixed targets are one thing.

231
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,290
How about this?

232
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,910
Nice job.

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,950
You have clearly mastered
your ability to focus.

234
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,030
Snips, are you losing focus?

235
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,420
- No, Master.
- Good.

236
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,620
A headshot

237
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,530
is the only decisive way
to disable a droid.

238
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,500
They don't need arms, legs,
or even bodies

239
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,960
to pass intel to central command.

240
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:40,030
All right, shoot at will.

241
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,470
Wait a minute. What is that?

242
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,780
Droids!

243
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
Take cover!

244
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,760
It appears the training is over.

245
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,170
I'll take the left flank
if you take the right.

246
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,210
No, Anakin.
We can only protect them.

247
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,510
We cannot fight this war for them.

248
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,920
There are too many.

249
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:34,220
But Anakin, Ahsoka, and I
can hold them off

250
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,950
while you get your people out of here.

251
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,140
You didn't teach us to run.

252
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:42,790
Saw, use your disruptors
to take out the droids.

253
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,060
I'm on it.

254
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,230
Ready disruptors.

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,900
On my mark.

256
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,540
Now!

257
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,870
What is that?

258
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,370
It looks like an explosive.

259
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,440
How can you te...

260
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Not bad.

261
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,050
That is only the first wave.

262
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,590
We'll handle this.

263
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,690
No, I will.

264
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,000
Duck!

265
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,030
Ah!

266
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,090
Hey, Bonteri, you ready to try again?

267
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
Hey, what are you doing?

268
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,030
What you taught us.

269
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,230
Clang!

270
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,230
Surrender, rebel. Uh...

271
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:59,070
You will answer for your crimes
against the Separatist Alliance.

272
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,420
We, uh, need to clean you up.

273
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:17,050
I like it.

274
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Now you look more like a soldier
than a politician.

275
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:23,830
Well, maybe a good politician
needs to get dirty now and then.

276
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,400
Take confidence from this victory.

277
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,740
But rest assured,
there will be more droids coming

278
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,840
now that they know your position.

279
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,240
It doesn't matter.
You're ready now.

280
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,880
We are going to take the fight
to the droids.

281
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,220
You don't have to hide
in the jungle any longer.

282
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,750
Droids were a bit dim,
more so than I imagined.

283
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,720
They make up for it in numbers.

284
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,460
They're designed to overwhelm.

285
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,660
But they're not designed
to deal with our approach.

286
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,760
We hit them
where they least expect it.

287
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,430
And before they realize
what happened...

288
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,700
We fade in
with the rest of the population.

289
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,330
Exactly.

290
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,170
We need a plan to get inside the city.

291
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,840
I have an idea.

292
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,230
Identification please.

293
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,040
Halt.

294
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,540
What were you doing
outside of the city gates?

295
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,587
Hunting.

296
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:50,280
We've been trekking for days.

297
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,220
Did you register
before your excursion?

298
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,620
No, but most of our time
is spent in the bush,

299
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,220
collecting our traps.

300
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:01,490
We come to the city to sell.

301
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,590
You can't get thrip larva
like this in Iziz.

302
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,330
Only the biggest trees
on the other side of Onderon.

303
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,700
Hey, listen,

304
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,470
we need to deliver all of this
in time for supper.

305
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,640
Hmm.

306
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,240
Are you scanning anything?

307
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,350
It's hard to tell
with so much organic matter.

308
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,440
Come on!

309
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,340
Our merchants are waiting inside.

310
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,850
Can you hurry it up?

311
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,580
Let them through.

312
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,650
Roger, roger.

313
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,130
Good plan.

314
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:39,290
Like Saw said,

315
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,000
those droids are dumber
than we thought.

316
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,540
Not a bad start.

317
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,340
But now the hard work begins.

318
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:57,480
You must find recruits
and choose your targets wisely.

319
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,420
They'll be looking for us.

320
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,920
We should split up.

321
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,190
Regroup after nightfall.

322
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,220
I'll alert our brothers.

323
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,670
We'll make sure you have
the supplies you need.

324
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,730
Rex and I will take care of that.

325
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,860
Good luck.

326
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,930
You too.

327
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,610
How do you think they'll do?

328
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,080
I have a feeling
we'll be pleasantly surprised.

329
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:37,920
So you admit our new strategy
will work?

330
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,760
I am hopeful, Anakin, hopeful.
