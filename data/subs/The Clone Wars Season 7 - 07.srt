1
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,726
<i>Prisoners of the Pykes!</i>

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:20,395
<i>Ahsoka Tano has teamed up</i>
<i>with the Martez Sisters</i>

3
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:23,398
<i>who live in the underworld</i>
<i>of the city planet Coruscant.</i>

4
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,651
<i>Struggling to make ends meet,</i>
<i>Rafa Martez scored a job</i>

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>running a spice shipment</i>
<i>from the planet Kessel.</i>

6
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Tempers flare when Ahsoka realized</i>
<i>the spice was being sold to the Pykes,</i>

7
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>a powerful crime syndicate.</i>

8
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,456
<i>As Ahsoka and Rafa argued,</i>
<i>Trace Martez dumped the spice,</i>

9
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,124
<i>hoping to end the dispute.</i>

10
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:46,838
<i>With no shipment to deliver, the three</i>
<i>attempted to deceive the Pykes and failed.</i>

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,340
<i>We now find them imprisoned</i>

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,801
<i>deep within a fortress</i>
<i>on the planet Oba Diah.</i>

13
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:03,480
I never figured
when I took my ship out for the first time

14
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,398
I'd wind up in a place like this.

15
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,984
Hey, you dumped the spice.

16
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:11,654
We wouldn't be here if you hadn't
taken the job with the Pykes.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,910
Fact, if she doesn't dump the spice,
we finish our job, and we're already gone.

18
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:21,790
Fact, the Pykes turned spice
into something that ruins lives.

19
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:24,751
-So, those lives would be on you!
-Says who?

20
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:29,005
That's just the way it is. You can't
profit from other people's suffering.

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,590
Or at least, I won't let you.

22
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:35,053
Will you listen to this?
We got a regular Jedi here.

23
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,180
What if I was?

24
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,182
Don't kid around.

25
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:43,061
-You didn't tell her, did you?
-Tell me what?

26
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,439
About why Trace and I
keep our distance from the Jedi,

27
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,149
or any Topsiders for that matter.

28
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,693
Oh, shut up, Rafa.

29
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,277
I don't think so,

30
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,864
not if Miss "High Ideals" here
is gonna lecture me about morality.

31
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,576
A couple of years ago,

32
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,205
there was a prison break on the surface
of Coruscant, where you live,

33
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,041
some gangster named Ziro.

34
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,003
Then came the Jedi.

35
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:13,049
We watched, like so many others, as they
chased Ziro and his gang down the portal,

36
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,094
leaping from speeder to speeder
as they went.

37
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,556
Finally, some red-eyed alien
protecting Ziro

38
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,351
blasted the engine
of an ascending cargo transport.

39
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,771
The ship went spiraling out of control.

40
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:30,358
The Jedi went into action,
tried to gain control of the ship.

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,738
There was a populated landing platform
right in the path of the ship,

42
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,825
but the Jedi steered it clear of that,
right into the portal wall.

43
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,454
And on the other side of that wall
was our home.

44
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,125
Mom and Dad saw it coming.
They got Rafa and I out.

45
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:49,461
But they weren't so lucky.

46
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,047
The Jedi didn't even capture Ziro.

47
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,175
The "distraction" of the ship
helped him get away.

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,639
Afterward, the Jedi came back,
and one of them came over to me.

49
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,351
I'll never forget it.

50
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,522
She was beautiful, dark robes
contrasting against her light green skin.

51
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,358
Penetrating eyes.

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,986
She looked at me,
and you know what she said?

53
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:24,162
She said, "I had to make a choice,
but not to worry,

54
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,873
the Force will be with you."

55
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,168
That's it. Then she was off.

56
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,172
And Trace and I were left without parents,
without a home,

57
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:37,550
just left there
to find our way in their system.

58
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:45,392
I've spent every day since
building a new life for me and Trace,

59
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:51,147
and it's about us not depending on Jedi
or these criminals or anyone else.

60
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,068
We make our own rules,
and we survive just fine!

61
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,904
That is, until Trace let you tag along.

62
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,074
I'm so sorry.

63
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,743
Martez.

64
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,208
Martez, come with us.

65
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,668
Which one?

66
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,211
Rafa.

67
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,421
You're not touching her.

68
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,257
Yeah, she's right. Take her instead.

69
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:24,889
Would you--

70
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,184
Trace, if I die,
you get the family business!

71
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,062
But I don't want the family business!

72
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,439
Well, it's yours anyway!

73
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:36,317
But you're not gonna die!
I'll figure something out!

74
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,527
Figure it out quickly!

75
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:52,584
Hey, uh, if you want to know the truth,
uh, pain really doesn't help me focus.

76
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,462
Talking?
Now, talking is always a good thing.

77
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,468
Look,
now that I think about it,

78
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,721
I think the people on Kessel scammed us.

79
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:23,782
You know, Rafa is telling the truth.

80
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:28,161
Since that day, it's really been
us versus everyone else,

81
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,454
until you showed up.

82
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,915
So, why'd you bother with me?

83
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,336
It's something my mother would've done.

84
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,048
She always believed in helping others.

85
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,511
This life I have,
it's not how I was raised.

86
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,762
It's how it is.

87
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,020
What did you do to her? Answer me!

88
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,980
Don't make them mad, Trace.

89
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,651
How about they don't make me mad
and tell me what they did to my sister!

90
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,072
Let her go!

91
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,534
Make sure Rafa's okay!

92
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,202
Trace!

93
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,430
Where is the spice?

94
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:31,891
Okay, look.
I'll tell you where the spice is.

95
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,227
I just didn't want my friends
to hear me tell you.

96
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,807
Okay, I'm gonna get one shot at this.

97
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:22,692
Rafa.

98
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,445
I don't know where the spice is!

99
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,323
Hey. Hey. It's all right.

100
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,116
Where's Trace?

101
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,495
They took her, but listen, we have to go.

102
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,579
Now!

103
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,082
How'd you do that?

104
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
It wasn't me.

105
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:41,670
I think there was a power outage,
and the energy field turned off.

106
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,296
About time we caught a break.

107
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,798
Let's go get Trace.

108
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:07,862
Hey, let us out!

109
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:11,991
Hey!

110
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:31,594
Ah!

111
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,142
Are you crazy? I could have shot you!

112
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,812
You gotta be kidding me.
We came to rescue you!

113
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,315
No, I was on my way to break you two out!

114
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,736
-This way!
-No, this way!

115
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,654
Tiebreaker, come on!

116
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,507
Trace, it's too late!

117
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,258
I'll take my chances.

118
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,182
Ah!

119
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,394
Uh, Trace! Careful!

120
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,773
You see that? Come on, Ahsoka!

121
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,985
If you can't make it, Ahsoka,
we'll be back for you!

122
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,154
Let's get outta here. She won't make it.

123
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,990
We can't just leave her!

124
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:19,869
Wait, where'd she go?

125
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,122
She didn't make it.
That's terrible.

126
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,581
Ahsoka!

127
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,333
I'm here.

128
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,503
-How'd you do that?
-I'm more athletic than I look.

129
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,714
-That's not normal.
-We don't have time to discuss this.

130
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,798
Let's go!

131
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,524
Finally. There's our way out.

132
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:17,427
All of this effort to kill us is crazy.

133
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,513
You'd think these Pykes
have never pulled a fast one

134
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,599
or had a fast one pulled on them.

135
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,769
This is what happens
when you get into business with criminals.

136
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,937
When you're trying to make a living,

137
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:32,150
you don't really think of the possible
torture or execution part of the deal.

138
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,861
The Pykes aren't gonna let us
get off this planet.

139
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,905
Their reputation is at stake.

140
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,824
Fine. Ahsoka, you seem resourceful.

141
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:43,036
You go disable the gates
while Trace and I distract the guards.

142
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,289
That must mean you think
disabling the gate is the difficult part.

143
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,045
Looks like you two
are getting along better.

144
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,674
Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving.
Come on.

145
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,701
Looks like they're in trouble again.

146
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,186
Nice shot.

147
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,021
Hey, come on.

148
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,706
I don't believe it. I think I see my ship!

149
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:57,671
You might be cut out for this life,
but I'm not sure about Trace.

150
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:02,342
If she doesn't wanna be involved
with the jobs I do, she can say so.

151
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,802
Do you think she'd say no to you?

152
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,894
You're her sister.

153
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,772
She'd never think you don't have
her best interests at heart.

154
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,567
What do you want?
What's in this for you?

155
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:24,698
Hey, got any credits?
I need something to eat.

156
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,533
Do I look like I have credits?

157
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,244
Well, if you didn't, I wouldn't be asking.

158
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,538
We're busy right now. Get out of here.

159
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,997
Come on. Let's go.

160
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,255
You never answered my question.

161
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,716
In my life,

162
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,387
when you find people who need your help,
you help them, no matter what.

163
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,848
I guess it's just who I am.

164
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,726
I knew someone who used to talk like you.

165
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:55,562
Yeah, Trace told me.

166
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:58,857
I'm just trying to do what's best.

167
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,824
Hey, you guys got any credits?

168
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,326
No, get out of here.

169
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:11,911
Wait.

170
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,497
Are you looking for them?

171
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,875
Have you seen them?

172
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,294
What's it worth to you?

173
00:15:27,302 --> 00:15:28,386
There she is.

174
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,264
The <i>Angel</i> is parked
on one of the landing platforms.

175
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,767
All we have to do is find a way up there.

176
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,852
Forget about your ship.

177
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,356
Let's take the first thing we can find
and get off this rock.

178
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,734
No! I just finished
putting the <i>Silver Angel</i> together.

179
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,111
And if you're smart,
you'd wanna live to build another

180
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:47,530
instead of dying
to get the one you've got.

181
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,700
If we leave my ship behind,
you're buying me a new one.

182
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,244
As long as I'm alive to fund one,
I'm good.

183
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,207
There they are.

184
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:00,877
Run.

185
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,647
Hey!

186
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,276
The speeder. There!

187
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:06,860
What do you think?

188
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,364
I'm not sure.
It could be the Jedi I met on Carlac.

189
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:14,451
But if it is her, what is she doing here?

190
00:17:15,118 --> 00:17:18,038
Her presence could compromise our mission.

191
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:22,334
Perhaps,
but don't forget we have a common enemy.

192
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,003
Let's keep track of her.
She could be of use to us.

193
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:41,519
<i>You cost me thousands of credits.</i>

194
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,522
<i>And then you tried to cheat me.</i>

195
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:49,194
<i>Did you honestly think</i>
<i>you'd get away with fooling a Pyke?</i>

196
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,531
Well, uh, I mean, we wouldn't have tried
if we didn't think--

197
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:57,243
-<i>Silence!</i>
-Kill them. And let's move on.

198
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,662
I thought you wanted to know
where the spice was?

199
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:04,334
<i>Your little friend is still in the city.</i>

200
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:09,798
<i>When we find her, I'll torture her</i>
<i>and find out everything we need to know.</i>

201
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:36,533
<i>Now, execute them and be done with it.</i>

202
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,452
This is not the way I saw this job ending.

203
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,333
Ahsoka!

204
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,069
We're clear. Let's go, Rafa.

205
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,487
I've had enough of this planet.

206
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:29,085
I knew keeping them in the open
would draw you out.

207
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:47,729
Listen. I think there's a way
we can work this out.

208
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:51,900
How about we do a job
for the great Marg Krim?

209
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:55,779
You didn't get it right the first time,
Martez.

210
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,531
Why would I waste any more time with you?

211
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,451
What? You planning on torturing us again?

212
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,287
Until you give me my spice.

213
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:15,215
Guys, I'm sorry.

214
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,842
I know,
I never should have taken this job.

215
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,265
We live and learn, Rafa.

216
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,186
Yeah, but for how much longer?
