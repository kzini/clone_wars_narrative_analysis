1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,470
<i>Invasion!</i>

2
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,740
<i>The planet Cato Neimoidia
is under Separatist attack.</i>

3
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,010
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ashoka Tano,</i>

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:28,750
<i>rush to the rescue as they lead
a squadron of starfighters</i>

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,100
<i>to the planet below.</i>

6
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,440
Ahsoka, punch a hole
for the gunships to get through.

7
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,340
I know the drill, Master.

8
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,750
Look out, incoming missiles.

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
No problem.

10
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,700
Uh... slight problem.

11
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,940
Ahsoka, I've got buzz droids.

12
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,070
How bad did you get hit?

13
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,440
I'm all clear.

14
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,640
What?

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
You always have it easy, Snips.

16
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,930
Good job, R2.

17
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,930
Someday these droids will learn
they keep messing

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
with the wrong Jedi.

19
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,100
Looks like you're clear.

20
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,740
Just keep watching
and learning, Padawan.

21
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,710
Uh-oh.

22
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,886
You're trailing smoke.

23
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,887
What's wrong?

24
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:52,650
Oh, nothing serious.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,550
Just a small malfunction.

26
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,820
Ugh!

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,030
Master?

28
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,400
Master, come in.

29
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,300
R2, what's going on over there?

30
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:06,810
Unconscious?

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,010
Fly back to the cruiser.

32
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,756
What do you mean there's something wrong

33
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,850
with the engines?

34
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,920
Tip your wing.
I'll see how bad it is.

35
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,830
Oh, that's not good.

36
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,830
Let's just say now would be
a good time to land.

37
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,080
R2, can you land the ship
on that cliff ledge?

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,720
I don't care if the landing zone
is too short.

39
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,490
Get that ship on the ground.

40
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,890
R7, take over the ship.

41
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,860
I'm going after Anakin.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,970
Somebody has to save his skin.

43
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,890
R2!

44
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,710
Ugh, very funny, R2.

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,180
Are you okay, Master?

46
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,780
Yeah, what'd I miss?

47
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,590
Oh, not much.

48
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,220
Wait a minute. Wasn't I flying?

49
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,237
Where's my fighter?

50
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,630
How did I get here?

51
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,760
Fighter crashed.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,777
I saved the day.

53
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,000
You're welcome.

54
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,110
Huh, all right.

55
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,550
Captain Rex,
Ahsoka and I need a little help.

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,930
Right away, sir.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,676
Master Yoda.

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,010
<i>Return to the Jedi Temple
quickly, you should,</i>

59
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,240
<i>you and your Padawan.</i>

60
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,950
We're kind of busy, Master Yoda.

61
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,650
<i>The reason we need you,
important it is, Skywalker.</i>

62
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,330
<i>Bombed the Temple hangar, someone has.</i>

63
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,200
<i>Your assistance to find
the terrorist, we need.</i>

64
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,200
Who could successfully bomb
the Jedi Temple?

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,240
We'll be right there, Master.

66
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,270
How could the Separatists
infiltrate the Temple?

67
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,730
Worse than that it is.

68
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,230
What could be worse, Master Yoda?

69
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,340
Everything is on the table.

70
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,950
We have to look at the possibility

71
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,350
that it could've been anyone
in the Temple, even a Jedi.

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,690
If a Jedi this is,

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,830
gone to the dark side they have.

74
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,630
I... I can't believe a Jedi

75
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,170
would attack a place this sacred.

76
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,180
We'd like for you two to lead
the investigation.

77
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,950
We can't trust anyone
who was here, even a Jedi.

78
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,096
You and Ahsoka will provide
an impartial point of view

79
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,290
free of assumptions.

80
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,090
We'll do everything we can.

81
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,130
Careful you must be, Skywalker.

82
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,000
If willing to destroy the Temple
the attacker is,

83
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,370
to great lengths they will go
to keep from being caught.

84
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,750
Then I guess we'll have to go
to even greater lengths

85
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,780
to catch him.

86
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,160
I can still hear the screams.

87
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,070
Do you believe what they said, Master,

88
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,110
that a Jedi could do this?

89
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,220
Not every Jedi agrees
with this war, Ahsoka.

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,890
There are many
political idealists among us.

91
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,520
But a traitor?

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm afraid one can eventually
become the other.

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,800
Remember Count Dooku and General Krell.

94
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,240
That's how they started, too.

95
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,370
Only analysis and investigation

96
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:14,040
will prove what is true or not.

97
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,380
Who are you?

98
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,680
I am Russo-ISC,

99
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,850
Crime Scene Analyzer for the Jedi.

100
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,860
I will be working with you
and your Padawan on this case.

101
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,430
I was assigned by Master Windu.

102
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,976
Okay, Russo,

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,840
you and Ahsoka should
begin the interviews.

104
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,740
I would rather interview
the witnesses alone.

105
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,750
Why?

106
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,780
Many of the wounded have heard rumors

107
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,920
a Jedi was behind this explosion.

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,036
There will be ill will toward you.

109
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,370
I think you're overexaggerating, Russo.

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,976
There were Jedi killed in that blast

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,270
along with maintenance crew and clones.

112
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,810
Take Ahsoka with you.

113
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,210
Let me know if you find anything.

114
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,780
I will, Master.

115
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
Did you notice anything unusual
about the hangar?

116
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,050
Not really.

117
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,450
Although, I left the
hangar five minutes before

118
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,780
the bomb exploded.

119
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,320
Did everything seem okay before that?

120
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,730
Everything seemed normal.

121
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,660
Is it true a Jedi might be
responsible for the attack?

122
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,070
We're not certain of anything
at this point.

123
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,450
This distrust is troubling.

124
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,420
Some of these people have worked
in the Temple for years.

125
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,990
Fear makes even the most
trusting individual irrational.

126
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,040
I think I know who did it,
who blew up the hangar.

127
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,410
Who?

128
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,710
I believe it was Jackar Bowmani.

129
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,620
Jackar Bowmani.

130
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,880
Who is Jackar?

131
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,450
One of the maintenance crew
in the hangar.

132
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,090
Why do you think it was him?

133
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:10,560
I passed him as I was going
on my shift change.

134
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,770
He...
he had been working all morning

135
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,940
in the section the blast came from.

136
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:17,170
It was the last place I saw him.

137
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,840
Is this him?

138
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,590
Yes.

139
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,850
I need to know, have you
seen him since the explosion?

140
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,360
No.

141
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,930
Truthfully, I didn't see much
of anything after the explosion.

142
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,270
Thank you.

143
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:42,650
Looks like we need to find
Jackar Bowmani, Russo.

144
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,300
Did you find anything?

145
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,240
No, but the rumor about it
being a Jedi is growing, Ahsoka.

146
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,980
I can feel the anger and confusion

147
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,150
throughout the Jedi Temple.

148
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,080
Russo and I have a lead.

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
We are looking for one of the
Temple workers, Jackar Bowmani.

150
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,220
One of the witnesses saw him in the area

151
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,030
where the bomb exploded
right before it happened,

152
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,846
and we have not been able
to find him anywhere.

153
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,610
Come on. Nobody just disappears.

154
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,380
Unless it was well planned out.

155
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,050
Well, it had to be well
planned out to get past Jedi.

156
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,030
I'll talk to security.

157
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,760
No more clones.

158
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,270
Stop the violence.

159
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,800
End the war.

160
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,370
Stop the violence.

161
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,580
They're all family and friends?

162
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,920
Yes, looking for answers.

163
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,590
So am I, Cin.

164
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,500
This is the guy who might be
behind all of this.

165
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,730
If you see him, alert me immediately.

166
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,740
That is Jackar.

167
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,170
You know this man?

168
00:09:58,210 --> 00:09:59,810
He is my husband.

169
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,656
I've been trying to reach him
since I heard of an explosion.

170
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Where is he?

171
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,550
I need you to come with me.

172
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,276
You have no idea where Jackar is?

173
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,470
No.

174
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,716
You are a Jedi, and you cannot find him?

175
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,980
I understand your frustration.

176
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,380
Don't. Just find Jackar.

177
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,260
Letta, do you think Jackar
could do something like this,

178
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,590
blow up the Temple?

179
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,030
Do you have any idea
what someone has to go through

180
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,330
to work in the Jedi Temple, hm?

181
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,500
Jackar dedicated his life
to serving the Jedi.

182
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,940
It had been his dream.

183
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,186
Not just anyone can walk into
your precious Temple.

184
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,650
He passed all the entry tests
that were needed.

185
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,050
Okay, I had to ask.

186
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,790
Unfortunately, everyone's a suspect.

187
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,370
Jackar would never do anything
like this.

188
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,500
Please, find him.

189
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,620
Hmm...

190
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,160
based on the trajectory of the debris,

191
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,100
it seems the blast came from there.

192
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,070
Why is there no bomb residue?

193
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,940
So you think whoever did this
triggered a ship to explode?

194
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,380
We think so.

195
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,950
Russo's trying to use the
shrapnel to determine that now.

196
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,720
The witness says he saw Jackar
in the area.

197
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,060
Maybe Jackar planned to do this
and just kept quiet.

198
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,190
Or...

199
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,800
It actually was a Jedi.

200
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,110
I found something, an anomaly,

201
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,550
something that should not be here.

202
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,500
These pieces came from the blast origin.

203
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,400
They are covered with microscopic droids

204
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
of a highly volatile nature.

205
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,940
Nano-droids.

206
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,320
Yes, nano-droids.

207
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,850
Great.

208
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,620
Now we're chasing nano-droids.

209
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,590
Russo, go through security footage.

210
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,430
Try to see if Jackar went
to other parts of the Temple.

211
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,870
Ahsoka, let's go find out
how Jackar got his hands

212
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,670
on these nano-droids.

213
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,720
Bowmani's file, Master Jedi.

214
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,220
He's a munitions expert.

215
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,036
Jackar was the foreman over
all of the gunships,

216
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,890
bombs, and weapons.

217
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,800
His specialty was nano-weaponry.

218
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,070
We've got to find this guy.

219
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,650
Isn't that going a little
too fast for you

220
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,850
to make sense out of it?

221
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,420
It is simple data.

222
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:18,560
At this pace, I am able to view
hundreds of hours of footage.

223
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,330
Have you found Jackar?

224
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,560
No.

225
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,500
I'll gather some Jedi
and search the Temple.

226
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,970
If he's still here, he might be
planning another attack.

227
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,210
Instead of Jedi,

228
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,980
I have droids
that can do the job much faster.

229
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,740
So you've found nothing so far?

230
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,410
We have a clue we're following.

231
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,280
But we still don't have answers.

232
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,490
It is imperative
that the truth be found soon.

233
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,590
There are whispers
the Senate will have a meeting

234
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,570
to decide whether the military police

235
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,270
will need to become involved
in the investigation.

236
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,900
They can't do that.

237
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,670
Clones died in that explosion,

238
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,440
maintenance clones working
on the gunships

239
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,850
as well as civilians.

240
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,910
The Senate tends to take notice
of these things

241
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,850
no matter where they happen.

242
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:24,830
Master Skywalker, we have found Jackar.

243
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,330
Lock down all exits so he can't escape.

244
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,580
Where is he?

245
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,260
Well, part of him is here.

246
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,160
I don't think now
is a good time to joke.

247
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,800
This is all that remains of Jackar.

248
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,246
His hand?

249
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:56,310
The rest of him exploded.

250
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,820
Because he was so close to the bomb?

251
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,990
Because he <i>was</i> the bomb.

252
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,150
What's this?

253
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,820
The connection we were looking for

254
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,290
to the explosion in the hangar.

255
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,360
The nano-droids.

256
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,700
How did they get in his bloodstream?

257
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,916
Oh, this just keeps getting
better and better.

258
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,510
We're going to have to search
Jackar's home for evidence.

259
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,250
This is not the nicest place.

260
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,920
I would've thought working
for the Jedi paid better.

261
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,340
Letta? Are you here?

262
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,280
You search for the droids,
but be careful,

263
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:10,680
and remember, he was a munitions expert.

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,690
I'd rather not set off
another explosion today.

265
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,890
I'll see if he left a note.

266
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
Letta?

267
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,650
Master.

268
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,750
The sensors are picking up
traces from the disposal.

269
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,330
The nano-droids
were in the food.

270
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,630
Well, I guess the question now is,

271
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,576
did he eat them willingly,
or did someone feed them to him?

272
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,340
Wh-what are you doing here?

273
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,810
We've learned Jackar
was involved in the bombing.

274
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,186
That can't be true.

275
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,580
See if she has any nano-droids
on her, Ahsoka.

276
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:02,190
Nanodroids?

277
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:03,300
She's clean.

278
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,000
What do you mean, "nano-droids"?

279
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,370
We believe someone set Jackar
up and made him the bomb.

280
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:15,310
I... I don't understand.

281
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:18,050
Letta, I want to bring you in
for more questioning.

282
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,090
Maybe you can help us make sense
out of all of this.

283
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,670
I'll answer any question I can.

284
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,130
Letta, stop.

285
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,870
Letta!

286
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,470
Letta.

287
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,980
Take the high road.

288
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,820
Right, Master.

289
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,240
Letta, stop!

290
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,480
Let me go.

291
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,620
Running means you know more
than you're telling us.

292
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,050
Jackar is dead,

293
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:45,560
and now you're trying to blame
his murder on me.

294
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,630
Nobody ever said he was dead.

295
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:54,340
But running proves you had
something to do with the bomb.

296
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,610
You don't know what
you're talking about.

297
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,080
People blamed Jedi because of you.

298
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,626
People were killed because of you!

299
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,650
You can't prove anything.

300
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,960
Did you feed the nano-droids
to Jackar?

301
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,006
You will answer me.

302
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,370
Now!

303
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:16,040
I did feed the nano-droids
to Jackar.

304
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,180
You set up your own husband to die?

305
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,320
You're dealing with things
you don't understand.

306
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,160
Oh, where you're going,

307
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,260
you'll have plenty of time
to explain everything.

308
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,176
We're holding Letta
in the cell below the temple

309
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,640
to await further questioning.

310
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:38,810
<i>I am pleased to report
there were no other nano-droids</i>

311
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,320
<i>found in the sweep of the Temple.</i>

312
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,950
<i>I am also pleased to report,
based on the security footage,</i>

313
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,330
<i>Jackar Bowmani acted alone,</i>

314
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,230
<i>which means no Jedi was involved.</i>

315
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,370
Thanks, Russo.

316
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,470
Good job.

317
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,870
Did this woman say what her
reasons were for attacking us?

318
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,350
Not yet, but we're working on that.

319
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,020
I think we can guess
her motives easily enough.

320
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,780
Public opinion is
swaying against the Jedi.

321
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,290
That is becoming clear.

322
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,130
This war is becoming less
and less popular

323
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,140
every day it persists.

324
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,340
Master, I'm relieved
we solved this case, but...

325
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,250
What if it had been a Jedi?

326
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Yes.

327
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,626
I don't know how I would have felt

328
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,550
if a Jedi was really behind this.

329
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,030
There are going to be Jedi
who disappoint us, Ahsoka.

330
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,330
But as long as we know
there are good Jedi

331
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,000
who fight for what's right,
it makes it all worthwhile.
