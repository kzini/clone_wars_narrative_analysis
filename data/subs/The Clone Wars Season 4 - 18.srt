1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,160
<i>Supreme Chancellor in peril!</i>

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,630
<i>After surviving the ordeals of "The Box,".</i>

3
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,750
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi, working undercover
as assassin Rako Hardeen,</i>

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,300
<i>is invited to join Count Dooku's plot
against Chancellor Palpatine.</i>

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,170
<i>Working with a team
of deadly bounty hunters,</i>

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,880
<i>Obi-Wan travels to the planet of Naboo</i>

7
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,800
<i>where the Chancellor
will preside over the Festival of Light.</i>

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,270
<i>Now, as the Jedi Council and Count Dooku
finalize their respective plans,</i>

9
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,310
<i>a deadly confrontation seems inevitable.</i>

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,796
As you can see,
we've mapped the Chancellor's route

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,490
to and from the festival stage.

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,820
We know where he'll be at every moment
from the time we land on Naboo.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,950
What security measures are in place?

14
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,420
The Naboo Royal Guard
will have armed sentries

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,160
at all entry points on the palace.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,620
And the stage itself
will be sealed off by a ray shield

17
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,160
for the duration of the event.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,170
I see nothing here to worry about.

19
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,170
With complacency comes vulnerability.

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,250
Yes.

21
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,520
It is what we do not see that concerns me.

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,590
A long time to plan his attack,
Count Dooku has.

23
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,220
Yes.

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,710
We thought we'd have an advantage
with Obi-Wan on the inside,

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,640
but we've had no communication from him
in days.

26
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,530
Obi-Wan will do his part.
Let's make sure we do ours.

27
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,580
Whoa!

28
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,860
Shh!

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,950
Well, hello there.

30
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,750
All clear!

31
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,060
This is it, my friends.
The day of reckoning for the Republic.

32
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,060
I have it from a very reliable source

33
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,310
that everything will happen
exactly as we planned.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,900
Execute your roles
as you've been instructed,

35
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,820
and you will all be
immortalized in history.

36
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,490
Not to mention,
rewarded with enough credits

37
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,160
that you will never have to work again.

38
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,240
I will let Cad Bane take it from here.

39
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,800
Listen up, I'm only saying it once.

40
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,040
Each device tells you your position

41
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,300
and essential details
about your part of the plot.

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,080
Aren't you gonna tell us
how all the pieces fit together?

43
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,720
Derrown here is going to breach the shield.

44
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,470
Moralo Eval is the getaway driver.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,100
Two of you will act as guards
protecting the Chancellor.

46
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,100
And you, Hardeen,

47
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,860
are a sniper.

48
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,610
That's all you need to know.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,490
Once we have the Chancellor,

50
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,700
the devices will lead you
to the rendezvous point.

51
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,660
Any questions?

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,410
Now for our disguises. Everyone step back.

53
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,100
This will get us into the inner circle.

54
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,840
Step into the shadow hologram
and you will receive your new identity.

55
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:09,996
When you leave here, you will have

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,860
no communication
with the rest of the team.

57
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,890
All right, then, get to your positions.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,860
Well handled.
I should have put you in charge long ago.

59
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,400
A word of advice, though,

60
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,320
keep an eye on Hardeen.

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,450
There's something about him I do not trust.

62
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,620
Don't worry.
I'm keeping my eye on all of them.

63
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,830
Greetings, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,080
Welcome home, Chancellor.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,620
I'm thankful to the Jedi
for bringing you here safely.

66
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,000
Yes, Senator, it is good to be back,

67
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,140
although I think the amount of security
that has accompanied me is overkill.

68
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,560
With all due respect, Chancellor,

69
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,550
where your safety is concerned
there is no such thing as overkill.

70
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,230
So you keep insisting, Master Jedi.

71
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,270
But I've grown tired of discussing it.

72
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,690
Anakin, Ahsoka, welcome to the festival.

73
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,070
I've never seen the Festival of Light.
Sounds like a big event.

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,110
They're expecting a large crowd,

75
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,700
which means it will be difficult for Dooku
to attack during the ceremony.

76
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,420
That leaves the palace
as the best opportunity for an ambush.

77
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,210
Are you that certain an attack is imminent?

78
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,750
I'm afraid so,

79
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,170
which is why I'm making Ahsoka
your personal bodyguard.

80
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,960
At your service, My Lady.

81
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,090
If there's trouble,
Ahsoka will get you, the Queen,

82
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,970
and the rest of your staff to safety.

83
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,220
What about you?

84
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,800
Hopefully, I'll be where I always am.

85
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,510
- He means saving the day.
- Of course he does.

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,630
Make sure you have two guards posted.

87
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,130
Excuse me.

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,730
- Obi-Wan, thank goodness you're alive.
<i>- Yes, I've seen better days.</i>

89
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,930
I'm here, in Theed.

90
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,490
<i>- So Dooku's plan is still on?</i>
- Yes.

91
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,020
<i>How are they planning
to attack the Chancellor?</i>

92
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:07,820
Three of the bounty hunters
are disguised as senate guards.

93
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,190
Eval is the getaway driver

94
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,860
and they have a Parwan
that can pass through the ray shield.

95
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,240
I have a sniper rifle.

96
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,200
Don't worry. It's loaded with stun blasts.

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,540
I'm supposed to immobilize the Chancellor,
not kill him.

98
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,620
<i>Where are you?</i>

99
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,330
In a tower overlooking the plaza.

100
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,590
So the attack
is going to take place outside.

101
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,130
<i>Yes. From here,
I can be your eye in the sky.</i>

102
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,960
I'll be able to tell you
everything that's going on.

103
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,340
They will try to infiltrate
the security area.

104
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,050
Make sure you have someone
double check the guards' identities.

105
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,060
<i>That's going to take time.</i>

106
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,020
<i>You'll have to do your best, my friend.</i>

107
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,260
The stage is set.

108
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,840
<i>Activate the ray shield.</i>

109
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,180
Copy that, General Skywalker.

110
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,490
It is an honor to be here
for this momentous occasion.

111
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,860
The pride I feel for this planet
cannot be put into words.

112
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,160
847 years ago, Naboo joined the Republic,

113
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,170
and tonight we celebrate that union!

114
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,180
What's
your identification number?

115
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,310
SG-1984.

116
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,650
All right, move along,
but stay sharp.

117
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,450
Take a moment and look
around this glorious city of yours.

118
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,570
It wasn't long ago
this was all plasma mines.

119
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,990
Naboo has indeed come a long way.

120
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,660
But as we chart
a bold course for the future,

121
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,120
let us never forget our past!

122
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,470
Mace, so far so good.

123
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,270
Gotcha!

124
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,190
East side! The security
guard on the stairs.

125
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,610
Skywalker! The shield generator!

126
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,740
All right, you two,

127
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,370
take the Chancellor to that speeder
and get him out of here.

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,870
This way, Your Majesty. Hurry!

129
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,400
Blast! It's only good for one shot.

130
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,240
Mace, Anakin's down
and I don't see Bane anywhere.

131
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,160
I'll find him.

132
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,200
Let's make the switch.

133
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,260
You're coming with me, Chancellor.

134
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,100
Those tentacles
pack quite a punch.

135
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,190
Come on.

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,070
The Chancellor! The guard escorting them
is a bounty hunter!

137
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,790
Chancellor, are you all right?

138
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,340
Where is the Chancellor?

139
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,800
Move it, move it!

140
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,390
So long, Jedi!

141
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm going after the Chancellor.

142
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,990
Copy that, Obi-Wan.

143
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,990
I'll send you the coordinates
and hold Bane there as long as I can.

144
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,710
This is the rendezvous point.
Dooku said he would meet us here.

145
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,510
What did I tell you, Bane?
My plan worked to perfection.

146
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,760
It wasn't your plan.

147
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,850
It was my execution of your plan.

148
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,180
Come on, get up.

149
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,060
How dare you disrespect Moralo Eval!

150
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,520
Pipe down. Where's Dooku?

151
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,690
I thought you said he'd meet us here?

152
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,440
That was the plan.

153
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,370
Hardeen, you're not supposed
to be here yet.

154
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,870
I don't want to be double-crossed
and left behind again.

155
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,210
I think we've all been double-crossed.
Dooku's a no-show.

156
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,050
What do you mean?
What do we do with the Chancellor now?

157
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,220
We'll ransom him ourselves.

158
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,590
If Dooku won't pay us, somebody else will.

159
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,760
I'm afraid the Chancellor's coming with me.

160
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,720
Please! Do not kill Moralo Eval!

161
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,180
Take him and Bane into custody.

162
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,600
And make sure the Chancellor
is returned safely to the palace.

163
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,650
You did a good job, Obi-Wan.

164
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:07,860
Kenobi! I should have known.

165
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,740
Something smelled wrong about you
from the start.

166
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,200
Yes, well, spending so much time with you
was no reward either.

167
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,290
Reward! I'll give you a reward,
when I plug you full of laser bolts!

168
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,710
Such a pleasant fellow.

169
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,590
I hope this was all worth it.

170
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,920
We saved the Chancellor.
That's the important thing.

171
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,530
Once again, you have all distinguished
yourselves in the eyes of the Republic.

172
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,940
The people of Naboo are in your debt.

173
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,320
It's all part of the job, My Lady.

174
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,830
I'm not sure I agree with your orders

175
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,880
to send the rest of the security detail
back to Coruscant.

176
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,340
Now that the threat has passed,
I think Anakin is all the security I need.

177
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,420
You look terrible.

178
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:14,550
Being a criminal's not easy work.

179
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,140
If I'd known what was going on,
I could've helped you.

180
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:19,470
Too bad the Council didn't trust me.

181
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,730
Anakin, it was my decision
to keep the truth from you.

182
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,230
I knew if you were convinced I was dead,
Dooku would believe it as well.

183
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,240
Your decision?

184
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,610
Look, I know
I did some questionable things,

185
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,030
but I did what I had to do.

186
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,880
I hope you can understand that.

187
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,370
You lied to me!

188
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,200
How many other lies
have I been told by the Council?

189
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:45,540
And how do you know
that you even have the whole truth?

190
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,010
We should get you
into the transformation chamber.

191
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,640
Everyone's a little tired
of looking at that ugly face of yours.

192
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,190
This is the face that saved the Republic.

193
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,060
But I think you're right.

194
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,980
It's time to go back
to being Obi-Wan Kenobi.

195
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,330
I can sense something
is still bothering you.

196
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,030
Yes, something Anakin said
has me worried.

197
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,040
Do we know the whole truth?

198
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,080
I think I'll stay.
I need to check one last thing.

199
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,040
Dooku was listening! He knew all along.

200
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:12,340
We will leave as soon
as Queen Neeyutnee's banquet is over.

201
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,090
I also want to say goodbye
to Senator Amidala.

202
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,260
She has been a very gracious host.

203
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,510
Hmm. Padmé didn't mention
a banquet to me.

204
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:23,350
Perhaps she meant it as a surprise.

205
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,980
I must say, the lengths the Jedi
will go to is nothing short of incredible.

206
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,030
I assume the brilliant plan
to disguise Obi-Wan Kenobi was yours.

207
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:37,860
No, it wasn't, sir.
I was in the dark as much as you were.

208
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,620
Really? Interesting.

209
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:44,160
I was under the impression
the Jedi always worked as a team.

210
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Welcome!

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,540
My gracious, it's a trap!

212
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:55,250
Chancellor, stay back!

213
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,850
You should've quit
while you were still alive, Dooku!

214
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:10,020
Fighting off the entire Jedi security force
would have been difficult.

215
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,490
But now that they are gone,

216
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,610
defeating you alone will be an easy task.

217
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,800
Chancellor, get out of here!

218
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,380
Good idea.

219
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Unhand me!

220
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,470
Are you all right?

221
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,010
Come on!

222
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,750
Well done, Master Kenobi.
You are a worthy adversary.

223
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,250
I cannot say the same
about your young apprentice.

224
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,050
Chancellor, are you all right?

225
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,850
Yes,
thanks again to the heroics of the Jedi.

226
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,430
That's the second time today.

227
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,140
We specialize in heroics, Chancellor.

228
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:00,730
As long as I live, no harm
will ever come to you, Your Excellency.

229
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,110
Hmm. Well, here's to your long
and prosperous life, Anakin.

230
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,530
One shudders to think
where the galaxy would be

231
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,370
without the Jedi.
