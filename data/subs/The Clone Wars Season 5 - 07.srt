1
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,150
<i>Ancient Jedi tradition!</i>

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,640
<i>Six younglings are sent
to the secret caverns of Ilum,</i>

3
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>where they are tested
by The Gathering,</i>

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,240
<i>an ancient Jedi ritual</i>

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,550
<i>where each youngling
must harvest a crystal,</i>

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,780
<i>around which they will construct
their own lightsaber.</i>

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,550
<i>Along the journey,
they underwent great perils,</i>

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,050
<i>hardest of which
was to face themselves.</i>

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,290
<i>Now, having passed the test,</i>

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,840
<i>they take their first step
into a larger world.</i>

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,610
I call that move
the "Whirlwind of Destiny".

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,080
Showoff.

13
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,800
Can everyone gather around, please?

14
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,820
You have all successfully passed
The Gathering

15
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,760
and harvested your crystals.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,606
So when do we start
to build our sabers?

17
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,500
Place your crystals on the table.

18
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,470
Your lesson begins now.

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,740
May I introduce you to architect
and lightsaber designer Huyang?

20
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,380
These are them.

21
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,720
I swear they get younger
every expedition.

22
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,320
All have passed The Gathering?

23
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,520
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,960
Are you sure?

25
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,360
But he's a droid.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,060
You expect us to learn from a droid?

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,000
Who said that?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,630
Many years I have been on this ship,

29
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,270
teaching many a Jedi before you,

30
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,840
and I will continue teaching
many a Jedi after you.

31
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,810
Call me what you want,
but inside my memory banks,

32
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,610
I contain a record
of every lightsaber ever made

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,140
and the Jedi who fashioned them.

34
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,210
Whoa! Look at that!

35
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,110
Which will you choose?
A simple grip?

36
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,850
The curved approach?

37
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,580
One inlaid with the bone
of the Cartusion whale,

38
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,420
pastillion ore, or black onk?

39
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,190
Well?

40
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,450
From Battles of Rashfond
to the Peacekeeping of Parliock

41
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,060
to our very own Clone Wars,

42
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,460
the lightsaber is a Jedi's
only true ally.

43
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,990
But how do they work, hmm?

44
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,500
Yes, you have brought me crystals,

45
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,930
but they're all useless
unless you give them life.

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,900
Do you know how to awaken
the Force within the crystal?

47
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,746
No?

48
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,570
Then I suggest you listen and learn

49
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,470
until you think of a question
this droid cannot answer.

50
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,380
A Wookiee.

51
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,950
Rare you are to the Jedi.

52
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,850
Proud your people must be.

53
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,750
Unique, just as
your lightsaber will be.

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,026
Hold out your hand, Wookiee.

55
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,920
Describe what you see
your saber to be.

56
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,460
No, no, no, not what you imagine

57
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,806
but what you feel in your hand.

58
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,200
Concentrate.

59
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,670
What will make you strong in battle

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,500
and humble in retreat?

61
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,670
What connects with your Force?

62
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,950
Ah, yes, wood.
Not a common choice.

63
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,780
And only wood from the brylark tree

64
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,090
is as strong as metal.

65
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,320
Let me see.

66
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:45,296
Where would we find that
all the way out here,

67
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,520
far from anywhere, deep in space?

68
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,536
Let's see what we have.

69
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,060
Let me see. Let me...

70
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,930
Yes, yes, yes.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

71
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,770
Ah, I wondered where I put that.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,640
Oh, that's not mine.

73
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,140
Ah, ah, what do we have here?

74
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,710
- Whoa, look at that.
- Ooh.

75
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,680
- Ooh.
- Wow.

76
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,220
You can say that again.

77
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,350
Wow.

78
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:25,020
It is my job,
before you leave this ship,

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,496
you will have everything you need

80
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,920
to build your lightsabers

81
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,090
and the knowledge of how to do it.

82
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,390
So let us begin.

83
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,130
There is much more work to be done.

84
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,310
Well, where are they?

85
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,280
The Jedi ship
is right in front of us, sir.

86
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,810
Lose them, and you'll lose
more than your head.

87
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,650
Our attack must be swift
and devastating.

88
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,830
They cannot have time to get away.

89
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,460
I thought we weren't going
to mess with Jedi anymore.

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,530
These aren't Jedi.

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
My sources say
they're just younglings,

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,670
headed back to the Jedi Temple
from a training mission

93
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,800
with the most important treasure
in the universe...

94
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,270
Kiber crystals,
used for making laser swords.

95
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,910
The price for just one
would make a man rich,

96
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,810
and we all know how much
I like to be rich, don't we?

97
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,060
What's the rush, Petro?

98
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,570
With this lightsaber,

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,070
I'm going to challenge
Obi-Wan Kenobi to a duel

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,700
and kill Grievous.

101
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,186
The only person
you are going to kill with that,

102
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,180
my young friend, is yourself.

103
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,120
You have inverted the emitter matrix,

104
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,650
which will cause the power grid
to backfire.

105
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,620
Light this, and all that will be left

106
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,960
of you and your lightsaber

107
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,390
will be your crystal.

108
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,766
Start again,

109
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,100
and this time,
please follow the diagram.

110
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,610
Remember, quiet your mind
and concentrate.

111
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,150
The design will become clear.

112
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,720
Good. Gently.

113
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,090
Trust the Force.

114
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
What was that?

115
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,390
I don't know. Hold on.

116
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,860
R2, what's happened?

117
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,130
Where?

118
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,530
Oh, no.

119
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,680
Ugh, they're aiming for the hyperdrive.

120
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,070
Get us out of here!

121
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,070
I don't like the sound of that.

122
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,610
Stay here.
I'll check on the younglings.

123
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,650
Excellent shot.

124
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,780
Fire the grappling harpoons.

125
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,670
Now reel them in,
and let's get what we came for.

126
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,560
What's happening?

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,130
We're being boarded.

128
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,930
Here? Why?

129
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,060
I don't know.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,960
Quickly, give me your crystals,

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,330
and I will hold on to them
until we are safe.

132
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,340
Younglings! Younglings!

133
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,070
Who's attacking the ship?

134
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,490
Pirates.

135
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,050
Pirates? They'll kill us all.

136
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:38,320
Perhaps we should hide
in the ventilation shaft.

137
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,560
Follow me.

138
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,320
Hiding is for cowards.

139
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,990
We should stand and fight.

140
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,400
Huh, we're gonna fight,
just not the way they expect.

141
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,370
Time to go.

142
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Is this part of our training?

143
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,670
It is now.

144
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,480
Shh.

145
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,410
Hondo says find the kids
and bring 'em to him.

146
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,710
Dead or alive?

147
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,050
Yes.

148
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,550
We must have courage, young Jedi.

149
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,460
Ganodi and Zatt, I need you
to get to the cockpit,

150
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,720
find R2, and secure it.

151
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,290
The rest of you, take Professor Huyang

152
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,260
and seal yourselves inside the hold,

153
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,000
and wait for my command.

154
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,130
What are you going to do?

155
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,030
I'm going to reroute
enough power to the engines

156
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,640
so that we can break free
of the pirate ship's hold on us.

157
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,100
Okay?

158
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,140
Wh... what about the pirates
already on board the ship?

159
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,140
Once the docking tube is ruptured,

160
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,040
when the ships pull apart,
a vacuum will be created,

161
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,180
which will suck the pirates
off our ship and into space.

162
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,860
Will we be sucked into space?

163
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,760
No, the cockpit and the hold
will be sealed

164
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,560
and still have air.

165
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,760
Do not, and I mean, do not
engage the pirates.

166
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,330
Your only job is to stay hidden.

167
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,030
Do you understand?

168
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,530
Now go.

169
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,470
I smell profit!

170
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,950
Nice, juicy, fat, warm profits.

171
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,250
Well?

172
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,750
Well, we've secured the ship,
but she seems deserted.

173
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,280
Imbecile!

174
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,820
That is the oldest trick in the book.

175
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,590
The runts are probably hiding
in the ventilation system.

176
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh. Right.

177
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:46,590
Didn't think of that.

178
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,690
Why does that not surprise me?

179
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,860
All that matters is you find
the younglings

180
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,030
and bring me the crystals.

181
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,230
If anything gets in the way, kill it.

182
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,370
But, boss, they're just kids.

183
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,580
They're just kids.
When will they learn?

184
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,110
In case you lack motivation,

185
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,990
remember that on the black market,

186
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,030
these crystals are priceless.

187
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,790
We can't fit in there.

188
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,666
Smoke them out.

189
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,860
You heard the boss.

190
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,040
I do love me a party.

191
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,100
Hold it!

192
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,900
Get off him!

193
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,200
Easy, there.

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,910
That's no way to make friends,
now, is it?

195
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,650
Thanks, buddy.

196
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,360
Come on, keep up.

197
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,930
The hold is not much further.

198
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,700
Something's wrong.

199
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,030
Unhand me, brigand!

200
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:48,280
Well, hello, girls and boys.

201
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,150
We've been looking forward
to meetin' ya.

202
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,110
Now, be nice,
and hand over your crystals.

203
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,720
Over my dead body.

204
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,070
That can be arranged.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,270
Petro, no.

206
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Your emitter matrix is still inverted.

207
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:18,130
So which one of you is first?

208
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:20,900
All bark, no bite.

209
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,770
Ah, that's for me.

210
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,480
I always wanted one of these.

211
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,610
You sure you can handle it?

212
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,880
Huh?

213
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,120
Everybody get down!

214
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,660
Let's go.

215
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,570
Hurry, hurry.
This way, younglings.

216
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,110
You could have killed him.

217
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,040
Look, we can keep running,
or we can stand and fight

218
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,610
and show these pirates
we're not afraid.

219
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,050
I cannot approve of such action.

220
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,430
Besides, I have been damaged
and cannot aid you in battle.

221
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,090
Petro's right.

222
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,260
It's our only choice:

223
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,130
Fight or be killed.

224
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,440
Zatt, <i>come in</i>.

225
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,070
<i>I am over</i> riding
the emergency power fail-safe

226
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,010
<i>and routing energy to the engines.</i>

227
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,210
It's working.

228
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,620
Any word from the others?

229
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,210
Have they reached the hold?

230
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,650
- Uh, not yet.
- <i>Where are they?</i>

231
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,620
I don't know.
I didn't hear from them.

232
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,720
Great. I know what that means.

233
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:00,400
Set them to the highest level.

234
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Get him!

235
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,700
Gungi!

236
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,120
Here, kiddie kiddies.

237
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,720
You can come out now.

238
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:31,190
No one's gonna hurt you.

239
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,690
Zatt, close the door
to the training room.

240
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,500
<i>Katooni, where are you guys?</i>

241
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,330
No time to explain.
Just close the door.

242
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,660
R2, close the door!

243
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,130
Hey, what's... what's going on?

244
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,720
We can't make it.

245
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:18,160
There are too many blocking the hold.

246
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,770
Well, children,
you have put up quite a fight,

247
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,940
but playtime is over.

248
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,080
Now, hand over my crystals,

249
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,710
and no one gets hurt... much.

250
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,950
Hondo, the Jedi Council

251
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:46,720
will not take kindly to this attack.

252
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,230
Ahsoka, how will they know
who is responsible

253
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,260
if there is no one left
to tell the tale?

254
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,670
You seem less hospitable
than our last meeting.

255
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:01,530
My mood is based on profit,

256
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,740
and today I am in the mood
for crystals.

257
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,870
You want the crystals?

258
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,510
Come and get 'em.

259
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,080
Oh, easy, now.

260
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,150
Hurry, hurry.

261
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,350
What about Ahsoka?

262
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:24,590
Trust her. Now, get in there.

263
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,460
Oh!

264
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,460
How dare you?

265
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,490
I've lived on this ship
a thousand years

266
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,960
and never lost a fight.

267
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,860
I'm not about to start today.

268
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,416
You know, had I known you were here,

269
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,380
I would have simply asked
for the crystals directly,

270
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,520
and we could have avoided all of this.

271
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,320
I don't want to hurt you, Hondo.

272
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:58,220
I know, and I appreciate that.

273
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,060
We're all in the hold,

274
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,060
but Ahsoka's still out there
fighting the pirates.

275
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,290
Ahsoka, Ahsoka, come in.

276
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,690
They've made it to the hold.

277
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,230
Then what are you waiting for?

278
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,600
But what about you?

279
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,630
Do it!

280
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,250
What are you doing?

281
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,690
Getting you off my ship.

282
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,360
Oh!

283
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,660
Whoa!

284
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,170
Whoa, whoa, ah!

285
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,690
Whoa!

286
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:22,260
We're all clear.

287
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,736
Make the jump to hyperspace.

288
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,530
Ah, ah, ah!

289
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,680
Yes! We did it!

290
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,740
They're off the ship.

291
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,580
Oh, Professor.

292
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,820
Bring him here. I'll fix him.

293
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,466
You should have seen Ahsoka.
She took them on all by herself.

294
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,930
Where is Padawan Tano?

295
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,660
Padawan Tano, come in.

296
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,406
Ahsoka.

297
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,100
Ahsoka! Ahsoka, are you there?

298
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,986
You have cost me greatly today,
young one.

299
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,110
And since you lost me so much profit,

300
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,750
I am left with no choice.

301
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,530
But to turn you into profit.

302
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,460
Good night.
