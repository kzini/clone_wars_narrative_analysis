1
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,016
Prisoners in peril.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,977
Former Jedi apprentice, Ahsoka Tano,

3
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,980
befriended two sisters,
Trace and Rafa Martez,

4
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,650
who grew up
in the underworld of Coruscant.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,902
After learning that the sisters blamed
the Jedi Knights

6
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,316
for the death of their parents,

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:32,490
Ahsoka must decide
if she's willing to reveal her Jedi past

8
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,334
and use her skills to aid in their escape.

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,827
Fearing her new friends
will feel betrayed by this revelation,

10
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:41,753
Ahsoka is left with a difficult choice.

11
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,422
Maybe we could pretend to be sick or dead.

12
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,343
What do you think we should do, Ahsoka?

13
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,677
Let's look at how we got here.

14
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,929
Oh, I know the answer to that.

15
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:59,273
We're here because you convinced Trace
to dump the spice and she did.

16
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,144
I never told her to do that.

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,308
Wait, so you're blaming me for this?

18
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,517
If we went through with my original deal,

19
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,318
we'd be back on Coruscant
counting our money right now.

20
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,114
But your original deal was the problem.

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,565
- For you!
- For me as well.

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,785
When did this happen?

23
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,786
What?

24
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,288
The two of you against me.

25
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,542
When it was always just you and me, Trace.

26
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,134
Always.

27
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,666
Rafa, I'm not choosing sides here.

28
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,918
- I'm just...
- Just siding with her.

29
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,965
Only in this case, Rafa.

30
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,379
But I look out for you.

31
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,547
She's your friend today.
But what about tomorrow?

32
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,966
And the next day, what about then?

33
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,935
You and I were always good.

34
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,812
Good until she showed up.

35
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,493
I think I know of a way
to get us out of here.

36
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,778
What's your plan?

37
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,280
It's better if you don't know.

38
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,198
I hope it's better than your last one.

39
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,452
Rafa, you need to trust me.

40
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,405
Me, trust you?

41
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:05,666
We each played a part in getting here,
now we need to do the same to get out.

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,750
But we have to trust each other.

43
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,302
What choice do I really have?

44
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,851
Come with us.

45
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,015
So, are you ready to make a choice?

46
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,977
Depends what the choices are.

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,401
Hmm.

48
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,355
Pay your debt or watch your friends die...

49
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,448
slowly.

50
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:40,606
I want to cut a deal with you, alone.

51
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:41,826
What?

52
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,411
You would betray your friends?

53
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,748
Trust me...

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,210
they're not my friends.

55
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,589
Where is my spice?

56
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,144
They hid the spice off-world.
I don't know where.

57
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,720
Send them to go get it
and give them one rotation.

58
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,056
If they don't come back,
I'll tell you where their family's from.

59
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,852
That should motivate them.

60
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:08,556
Ahsoka, why would you say that?

61
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,065
Because she's a snake,
just like I warned you.

62
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,029
And what do you get out of all this?

63
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,652
Just my percentage.

64
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,531
A small price to pay
for a rather large spice shipment,

65
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,115
once it's returned to you.

66
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,580
Very well.

67
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:31,174
You have one rotation
to bring back my spice.

68
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,918
If you don't,

69
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,588
I'll torture the information
out of your friend here.

70
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:42,846
And kill her, you and your family.

71
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,940
I won't forget this.

72
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,196
This is another deception.

73
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,829
I know. But I don't have much of a choice.

74
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,503
I must regain that spice.

75
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:13,461
My life depends on it as much as theirs.

76
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:17,423
You think he will find out about this?

77
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:22,142
He knows. He always knows.

78
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:32,188
Better be quick and bring back the spice.

79
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,535
I didn't scan the Jedi
leaving with the others.

80
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,625
Keep watch.

81
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,585
I wanna know
the instant she leaves the Citadel.

82
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,635
What are you up to?

83
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,456
I still don't understand
what Ahsoka was thinking.

84
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,458
She knows we don't have any family.

85
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,172
Uh, exactly.

86
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,843
But she has no leverage.
We don't have to go back.

87
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:47,061
What she did back there,
giving herself up for us. That's rare.

88
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,055
You don't see that much.

89
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,266
You mean that was her plan?

90
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,900
I thought that was clear.
"Trust me." Come on, Trace.

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,954
Okay. But if that's true,
how is she gonna escape?

92
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,946
I don't know.
But I'm not gonna let her try

93
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,541
because if she does,
she'll hold it over my head.

94
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:12,330
Wait, you're going back to help her,
so you can one-up her?

95
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,674
Now you're catching on.

96
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,540
So, how do we rescue Ahsoka
without getting captured again?

97
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,801
By delivering the spice, of course.

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:08,215
Since I'm here,
I might as well do some good.

99
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,282
All right. I'll hail the receiving dock,
let them know we're here.

100
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:33,906
So, we're stealing spice from the Pykes
to trade it back for Ahsoka?

101
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,405
Yes, exactly. Now be quiet.

102
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,838
This is transport 1519
coming in for a spice pickup.

103
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,841
Um, there is no record of your shipment.

104
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,425
There must be some kind of mix-up.

105
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,679
I'll clear it all up
when I get on the ground.

106
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,925
Oh, okay. Copy that.

107
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,135
See, easy.

108
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:59,555
If you're half as good at flying
as I am at this, we're in great shape.

109
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,122
Hey. So, you got some spice for me?

110
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:22,126
I told you, I do not have your shipment
listed anywhere.

111
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,837
You've never done
a special request pickup?

112
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,551
Ha! Very rarely.

113
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,176
Then today is one of those
"very rarely" situations.

114
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,929
Look, pal,
I don't want to get you in trouble,

115
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,806
but this is coming from up top,
if you know what I mean.

116
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,020
So why don't you just start
loading the spice onto my ship?

117
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,229
But, but I can't just give it to you.

118
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,816
Hey, I'm following instructions,
you should too.

119
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,360
Start loading things up.
I'm on a tight schedule.

120
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,605
B... But. B... B...

121
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,316
If it makes you feel better,
go find your boss.

122
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,285
But when he asks what the holdup is,
I'm gonna tell him it's your fault.

123
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,959
So, while you go get in trouble,
I'm gonna start loading up my ship.

124
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,922
Come on, guys. Let's get moving.

125
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:40,044
I assure you,
this delay does not change things.

126
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,538
We will proceed as planned.

127
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:50,127
You are but one small piece moving
in this mechanism which I have designed.

128
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:55,465
And yet when you falter,
it jeopardizes everything.

129
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,472
Do you understand?

130
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,476
I understand that the Republic
is cracking down on my operations.

131
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:08,151
Just a week ago they raided
one of my shipments arriving on Coruscant.

132
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,439
Were there Jedi?

133
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,316
I don't know. None of my men made it out.

134
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:19,575
Hmm. Well, then the answer is yes.

135
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,937
I have things to attend to
other than your incompetence.

136
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:48,439
Make sure there are no more delays.

137
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:54,862
And if there are, I am certain
Crimson Dawn would love the opportunity

138
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,026
to take control of your operation.

139
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,195
He plays members of the Collective
against one another.

140
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,753
An efficient way
to deal with our kind of business.

141
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,588
Surely Maul knows
we do not jump to his demand.

142
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,718
Would you care to make that clear to him?

143
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,940
Sir, come quickly.
The prisoner has escaped.

144
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,575
The transmission log.

145
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,838
Let's find out where you are.

146
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:58,426
Mandalore? What's Maul doing there?

147
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,100
I knew you were no petty smuggler.

148
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,428
Who are you?

149
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,368
A Jedi.

150
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,499
Are your friends Jedi as well?

151
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,083
No. Just me. They have no idea.

152
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:36,883
Well then, the Jedi Council will regret
sending you here.

153
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:56,150
Miss.

154
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,235
Uh, excuse me, Miss. Um.

155
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,156
I cannot find it anywhere on the manifest
for you to have this spice.

156
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,409
And my manager said
this is highly irregular. Yes.

157
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,412
Where is he? I don't see any manager.

158
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,366
You just don't want to do the work.
That's it, isn't it?

159
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,003
- Uh, Rafa.
- Not now.

160
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,464
So, where is this manager, huh?

161
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,803
Rafa, stop!

162
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,671
There isn't one, is there?

163
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,218
You little liar.

164
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,928
He's right behind you.

165
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,182
All right.

166
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,680
Oh.

167
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:30,515
You don't have authorization to be here.
I'm shutting you down.

168
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:35,192
Authorization? Uh, yeah. Of course.
Makes sense.

169
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,145
Let me see the ship's manifest.

170
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,235
Great idea.

171
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,610
Trace, why don't you give him
the manifest?

172
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,865
What? I mean, right.

173
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,269
- I, I, I left it on the ship.
- You're not going anywhere.

174
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:51,751
Hey. What do you know?
I got your manifest right here.

175
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,213
Yes. Kill her.

176
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,639
Ah!

177
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,933
Yes. Yes, get her. Get her.

178
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,836
- Ah!
- Ah!

179
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,961
Oh, no.

180
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,899
What?

181
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,989
See ya, pal.

182
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,372
Come on. Who's next?

183
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:17,998
Hey. Hey. Whoa. It's me.

184
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,456
Nice work. Come on.

185
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,399
I want to thank you.

186
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,605
Your execution
will help restore the Pykes' reputation.

187
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,027
Your timing is perfect.

188
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,494
Speaking of perfect timing.

189
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,328
Stop what you're doing.

190
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:00,497
Look, you don't have to execute her.
We brought your spice back.

191
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,745
Foolish.

192
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:07,467
We know you are both
working for the Republic and this Jedi.

193
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,006
Jedi?

194
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,474
Her, a Jedi? Come on.

195
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:17,351
I see. So, it is true.

196
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,685
The Jedi used you both.

197
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,150
How unfortunate
that your stupidity is so authentic.

198
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,110
Why didn't you tell me?

199
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:31,072
How could I after what you told me
about your parents?

200
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,452
Wait. So, you're actually a Jedi?

201
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:35,995
Was a Jedi.

202
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,119
So, you're not a Jedi?

203
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,495
I was trained. But I left.

204
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:40,708
You can do that?

205
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,919
Prepare to execute them all.

206
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:46,593
Look, now is really not the time
to explain all this.

207
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,722
Yeah. You know when the time was?

208
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,640
- When we were in prison.
- You should have told me.

209
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,200
Come on.

210
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:19,372
After them.
Or we'll all suffer the consequences.

211
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,518
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before,
Trace.

212
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,976
Well, if you're a Jedi,
I assume you're a good shot?

213
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,398
- Yes.
- Then shoot something.

214
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,661
Got another one closing point 4-6.

215
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,959
- Keep it tight.
- I'm on it.

216
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,293
I'm banking right.

217
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,264
- He bit...
- Got him.

218
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:20,139
- We've lost the rear deflector shields.
- And the gun.

219
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,345
Hang on.

220
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,854
- What are you doing?
- We might have lost the rear deflectors,

221
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,305
but we still have the front.

222
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,565
Uh, this isn't a good idea.

223
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,815
Yeah. I'm gonna agree with Ahsoka
on this one.

224
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,672
Whoo-hoo!

225
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:49,458
Glad we could help.

226
00:19:25,457 --> 00:19:29,207
Since the Pykes think I was an operative
working for the Jedi,

227
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:31,674
I don't think they'll come looking for you
any time soon.

228
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,168
So, maybe...

229
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:48,187
So, you're not going to arrest me
for spice smuggling?

230
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,148
- Why would I do that?
- Well, you're a Jedi, right?

231
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,782
Don't you make a living
tracking down criminals like me?

232
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:56,570
I told you, I was a Jedi.

233
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,324
I don't understand.

234
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,793
Why would anyone walk away
from being a Jedi?

235
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,452
It's complicated.

236
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:08,996
No offense but I don't want to hear
your complicated story.

237
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:10,501
Let me level with you.

238
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:14,585
You might not think of yourself as a Jedi,
but you act like one.

239
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:16,966
Or at least how I want them to be.

240
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,845
She's right. We got in over our heads.

241
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,679
Without you, we'd be done for.

242
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:27,185
Jedi or not, I consider you my friend.

243
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,517
Isn't this sweet?

244
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,402
Making friends?

245
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,073
Trace. Rafa. Back away.

246
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,570
So, you remember me.

247
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,954
Don't worry. Death Watch is gone.

248
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,577
And now, you and I have a common enemy.

249
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:49,249
Maul.

250
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,997
I need your help.

251
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,957
Once we are underway
I will explain everything.

252
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,797
You have five minutes to decide.

253
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,974
Sounds like she needs your help,
just like we did.

254
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:10,599
But if I go down this path,
I'm afraid where it might lead.

255
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,482
You mean, back to the Jedi?

256
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,571
Yes.

257
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,610
Go. It's what you're meant to do.

258
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,321
Rafa's right.

259
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,374
All right.

260
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:29,161
But let me keep my bike here,
just in case.

261
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:30,754
Deal.
