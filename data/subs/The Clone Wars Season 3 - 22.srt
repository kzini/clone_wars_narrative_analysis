1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,160
Jedi abducted!

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,500
Ahsoka Tano is missing in action.

3
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,660
Captured and released
into a hostile jungle,

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,790
she fights to stay alive with the help
of a small band of Jedi younglings.

5
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,960
As Anakin Skywalker scours the galaxy,
desperate to find his lost apprentice,

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,510
Trandoshan sport hunters
track their youngling prey.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,650
With the death of their leader Kalifa,
and separated from her friends,

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,020
we find Ahsoka on the run,
as the hunters close in around her.

9
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,660
Where is she?

10
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,750
This one was faster than most,
I've lost the scent!

11
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,580
She can't hide forever.

12
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,670
Mark my words,

13
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,810
I'll have her hide

14
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,090
and nail it to the wall for killing my son.

15
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,180
You made it!

16
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,090
We feared the worst.

17
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,100
Where's Kalifa?

18
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,520
She didn't make it.

19
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,440
She's dead?

20
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,860
I can't believe it.

21
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,780
She had been here longer than any of us,
and now...

22
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,360
We're all going to die here,
it's only a matter of time.

23
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,990
If it's only a matter of time till we die,
I say we go down with a fight.

24
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,130
That is suicide.

25
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,880
You've said that every few days
they release new prisoners on the beach.

26
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,770
I say we attack that dropship head on.
They'll never expect it.

27
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,470
Is it worth a shot?

28
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,560
Maybe it is.

29
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,240
Get ready, we'll have to be swift.

30
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,660
The drop point's not far.

31
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,000
Now!

32
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,260
What the...
It's one of those blasted Jedi whelps!

33
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,180
Get her!

34
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,900
I'll take the pilot!

35
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,190
Get out of there, come on!

36
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,280
But the prisoners! They'll die!

37
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,530
Hit the release, hurry!

38
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,970
Well, I guess we won't be escaping
on that ship.

39
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,070
We'll find another way.

40
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,060
- What was that?
- A survivor.

41
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
It could be one of the prisoners
they were dropping off.

42
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,000
What is that?

43
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,640
It's a Wookiee!

44
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,850
Ahh!

45
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,690
It's the younglings that did this.
They're getting bold.

46
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,860
What about survivors?

47
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Both of our men were killed,

48
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,030
and there was only one prisoner,
a Wookiee.

49
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,360
And he's missing.

50
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,700
So now the younglings are organized, bold,

51
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,750
and they've got a Wookiee.

52
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,630
Your name is Chewbacca?

53
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,050
Chewbacca, does anyone even know
you were taken?

54
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,060
No, but he says his home world
is very close.

55
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,280
That's great,

56
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,730
but it might as well be Coruscant,
as far as I'm concerned.

57
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,580
We've got no ship.

58
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,740
He thinks he can contact his home planet
if we find a way to transmit a signal.

59
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,450
Right, and how would we do that?

60
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,910
Send smoke signals?

61
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,290
We don't exactly have a transmitter
lying around, if you haven't noticed.

62
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,970
Chewbacca says he can build a transmitter
from the wreckage on the beach.

63
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,680
Well, we can't just sit here.

64
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,350
Fine, we'll do it the Wookiee way.

65
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,530
Chewbacca and I will go out
to inspect the crash site.

66
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,440
You two stay here,
and signal us if you see anything.

67
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,050
Get back! It's a patrol.

68
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,850
Happy hunting.

69
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,290
Hopefully that patrol
won't be back for a while.

70
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,040
What are we looking for?

71
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,300
Are you still feeling optimistic about
making a transmitter out of this junk?

72
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,550
Now, what do we have here?

73
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,830
We better get going.
That patrol might come back.

74
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,880
Come on, pretties. One more step.

75
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,550
It looks clear, come on.

76
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,720
It's okay.

77
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:31,650
Time to join the Force, Jedi!

78
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,480
Sniper! Get down!

79
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,090
I'll gut you, whelp!

80
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,980
Wait! We should take him prisoner!

81
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,280
Fine. Chewbacca, let's take him.

82
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,800
How's it looking, Chewbacca?

83
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,390
Will it work?

84
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,390
Well, something's working.

85
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,240
We've got a prisoner.

86
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,570
We should be using him to our advantage
while we have a chance.

87
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,490
I thought the prisoner
was the backup plan?

88
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,280
It's clear enough
that we cannot rely on that device.

89
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,040
No offense,
but we just can't sit here any longer.

90
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,500
We should wait.

91
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,840
I agree with Jinx, we have to act
while we have an advantage.

92
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,010
Let's say we do it your way,
what's the plan?

93
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,880
We can use the prisoner to trick the enemy
into flying one of their pods down to us,

94
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:27,390
then we hijack the pod,

95
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,680
fly up to their base
and take them by surprise.

96
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:34,110
Ahsoka, you got us
to believe in ourselves again,

97
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,600
and, well, I believe Jinx's plan will work.

98
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,020
Look, do what you want,

99
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,070
but O-Mer and I are leaving
with the prisoner in the morning.

100
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,410
Their hearts are in the right place.

101
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,410
You know I can't let them go alone.

102
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,500
We're not going to be able
to do this without you.

103
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,330
We need your help.

104
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,250
Who knows?
Maybe our luck's just about to change.

105
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,720
All right, we better get started.

106
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,770
Right, time to call your friends.

107
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,060
I'm not helping you, whelp!

108
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,610
Chewbacca,
we need him at eye level, please.

109
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,570
You will listen to me.

110
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,450
No, I won't.

111
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,960
You will listen to me.

112
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,960
I will listen to you.

113
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:46,710
You were our captive,
but now you've escaped.

114
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,720
I was your captive but now I've escaped.

115
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,180
You need to call a speeder to pick you up.

116
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,810
I need to call a speeder to pick me up.

117
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,900
Smug? Where have you been?

118
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:11,280
I need a speeder to pick me up.

119
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,510
Get in. Let's go.

120
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,770
Now.

121
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,990
Want a lift?

122
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,800
Krix and Smug should be back by now.

123
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,580
Kill them! Kill them! I want their skins!

124
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,210
Hey, let's give him a lift.

125
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:59,660
A valiant effort, little younglings,

126
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:03,120
especially you, Togruta.

127
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:09,080
You will be a prized trophy
in my collection.

128
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,430
Make it quick, General.
We're charging by the minute.

129
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,390
And if my ship gets damaged,
it'll cost you extra.

130
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,680
Can you get me up there?

131
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,960
Lo-Taren!

132
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,550
What?

133
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:56,290
You're beaten.

134
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,630
You murdered my son,

135
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,920
and you need to pay for what you did.

136
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,640
Your son died because of your own actions,

137
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,470
not mine.

138
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,520
Don't!

139
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,100
Ahsoka!

140
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,800
It is good to see you safe, little Soka.

141
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,220
Ahsoka, I am so sorry.

142
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,600
For what?

143
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:56,030
For letting you go,
for letting you get taken.

144
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,310
It was my fault.

145
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,310
No, Master, it wasn't your fault.

146
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,730
I should've paid more attention,
I should've tried harder.

147
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,780
You already did everything you could,
everything you had to do.

148
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,910
When I was out there, alone,

149
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,220
all I had was your training
and the lessons you taught me.

150
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,330
And because of you, I did survive.

151
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,460
And not only that,

152
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,920
I was able to lead
others to survive as well.

153
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,630
I don't know what to say.

154
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,800
I do.

155
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,850
Thank you, Master.

156
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,690
You're welcome, my Padawan.
