1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,450
<i>Invasion in peril!</i>

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,260
<i>Republic forces struggle to take Umbara,</i>

3
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,620
<i>a hostile planet
completely enshrouded in darkness.</i>

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,420
<i>Jedi General Pong Krell and Captain Rex</i>

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,260
<i>lead a battalion against a constant attack
by a brutal enemy.</i>

6
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,130
<i>Krell's aggressive
and reckless strategies backfire,</i>

7
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,470
<i>killing many clones.</i>

8
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,550
<i>Despite the Jedi General's
dangerous tactics,</i>

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,970
<i>Captain Rex's squad
successfully captures a critical airbase.</i>

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,640
<i>This further fuels
the mistrust of Krell's leadership,</i>

11
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,610
<i>dividing his men.</i>

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,660
The insurgents
have stepped up their attacks, sir.

13
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,460
They want their base back.

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,710
We cannot let our guard down
for a moment.

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,210
Have all Umbaran security
re-configured and locked down.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,630
Interrogate the prisoners if you have to,

17
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,630
but I want this base
under our complete control

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,430
and I don't want excuses.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,310
Sir, there's a transmission
from General Kenobi.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,520
I'll take it in the tower.

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,690
Hey, how's it coming?

22
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,360
Tricky piece of hardware.

23
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:39,030
Krell's got Jesse stacking ordnance.

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm still waiting for Krell to thank us
for handing this base over to him.

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,670
Where is he?

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,880
General Kenobi, do you read me?

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,220
<i>Congratulations on your capture
of the Umbaran airbase, General.</i>

28
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,550
<i>It's refreshing to have good news.</i>

29
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,770
There will be time for celebration
when we've taken that capital.

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,770
<i>Yes. Well, I'm afraid that's going
to be more difficult than anticipated.</i>

31
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,100
<i>Their attacks have increased</i>

32
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,770
<i>and their long-range missiles
are forcing us to retreat</i>

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,230
<i>from our positions.</i>

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,080
I was hoping we cut off
their arms shipments and supplies

35
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,530
when we took this airbase.

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,950
<i>It seems they're receiving
new arms shipments</i>

37
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,240
<i>directly from a supply ship orbiting...</i>

38
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,910
General Kenobi?

39
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,080
<i>We've been having
difficulty transmitting...</i>

40
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,950
<i>They must be jamming our signals.</i>

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,830
Can't we destroy the supply ship?

42
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,550
<i>We're trying, but with little success.</i>

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,250
<i>Their fleet outnumbers ours</i>

44
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,050
<i>and the extra ships we were promised
have not yet arrived.</i>

45
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,760
We'll just have to take that capital
regardless of the missiles.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,340
My battalion will meet you
at the rendezvous coordinates.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,470
<i>We cannot expect...</i>

48
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,030
I'm trying to get him back, sir.

49
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,100
Don't bother.
The enemy is jamming our transmissions.

50
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,610
We are on our own.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,580
Have those containers searched
and all weapons prepped and loaded.

52
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,120
Have the battalion ready to move out
in 12 hours.

53
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,540
We're advancing on the capital.

54
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,640
Sir, shall I try to get a message
to General Kenobi?

55
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:19,210
Shouldn't we coordinate our attack,
especially in light of the recent threat?

56
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,380
General Kenobi has his hands full,
same as us.

57
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,220
We need to throw everything we have
at them, now!

58
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,310
We'd be marching into a blast zone, sir.

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,140
Blasted insurgents.

60
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,900
I realize you haven't agreed
with all my strategies, Captain.

61
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,650
But you are smart enough
and loyal enough to obey my orders.

62
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,030
Now, prep those troops!

63
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,340
Those missiles have 100 megaton yield.
We won't even make it to the delta.

64
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,000
What can I do?

65
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,010
I've tried to reason with him.
Those are the orders.

66
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,390
Great. Another suicide mission.

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,260
The capital is too well armed.

68
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,720
Why does it seem like
he has it out for clones?

69
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,890
I think you're all overreacting.

70
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,520
Obviously,
General Krell knows what he's doing.

71
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,440
Do you really think
he doesn't care if he loses men?

72
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,980
I'm not saying that.

73
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,040
But I do think his desire for victory
has blinded him to the fact

74
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,820
that there are lives at stake.

75
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,870
I've never seen a general
with these kinds of casualties.

76
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,450
He's out of control!
He's not acting like the other Jedi.

77
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,950
He has no respect for us.

78
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:38,380
Listen, I don't agree with him either,
but I don't have a better plan.

79
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,840
What about using these starfighters
to destroy the supply ship?

80
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,380
Our fleet has been trying.

81
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,220
The Umbarans have it as protected
as the capital.

82
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,720
But we've got their access codes
and their own hardware.

83
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,100
You were able to crack it?

84
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,480
Mmm-hmm.

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,060
We can sneak right past their blockade,
get where our ships can't.

86
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:03,530
If we take out that supply ship,
then we cut off arms to the capital.

87
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,910
Sir, with all due respect,

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,380
might I suggest another option
to help us secure the capital?

89
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,460
What would that be, Captain?

90
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,170
My men have cracked the Umbaran codes.

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,430
With the starfighters, we can sneak past
the supply ship's defenses.

92
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,720
We take it out,
we cut off the arms to the capital.

93
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,770
And who do you propose
would fly these starfighters?

94
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,930
Are your troops now pilots?

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
My men may not be pilots, sir,

96
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,810
but they are able to learn
and adapt quickly.

97
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,190
A few of them
have already demonstrated that.

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,990
I'm afraid I can't afford to waste
any clones on frivolous adventures.

99
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,700
We're going to need everyone
to take the capital.

100
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,750
Sir, incoming. Sector delta.
Long-range missiles.

101
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,980
The assault on the capital

102
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,440
will continue as planned.

103
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,440
So that's it?
We just march into those missiles?

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,750
Oh, there's another option.

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,200
We go ahead with our plan,
and suffer the consequences.

106
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,660
You would be court-martialed.

107
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,510
If it were up to me,
and we had the time and the training,

108
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,830
I would say, "Do it."

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,600
But it's out of my hands and the truth is,
you are no pilots.

110
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,010
Come on.
If Hardcase can fly one of these things,

111
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,420
we all can.

112
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,430
Yeah, he wasn't really flying.
More like avoiding crashing.

113
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,010
We'll be blasted out of the sky
before we get anywhere.

114
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,690
Not if we're in their fighters.
No one's gonna be shooting at us.

115
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,490
Here comes Dogma.

116
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,480
Uh... What's going on?

117
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,860
Er... Nothing.

118
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,750
This is about
more than just following orders.

119
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,540
It is. It is about honor.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,130
Where is the honor
in marching blindly to our deaths?

121
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,710
It is not our call.

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
We are part of something larger.

123
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,690
We're not independent of one another.

124
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,140
I'm sorry. I cannot just follow orders
when I know they're wrong.

125
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,140
Especially when lives are at stake.

126
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,520
You will if you support
the system we fight for.

127
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,320
I do support it. I do!

128
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,820
But I am not just another number!
None of us are!

129
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,450
Fives, where are you going?

130
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,280
To round up some pilots.

131
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,550
All right.

132
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,510
Okay, there. Try that out.

133
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,180
It should be a little easier.

134
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,770
I got it.

135
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,400
Whoa!

136
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,610
Hardcase, what are you doing?

137
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,740
If I knew, I wouldn't be doing it!

138
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,280
Look out!

139
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Great. This can't get much worse.

140
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,300
Sir, there appears to be a disturbance
in Hangar 9-4.

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,390
Trooper, what's going on down there?

142
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Hey, hey, I got this.

143
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,470
<i>Report, Trooper.</i>

144
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
Er... Yes, sir.
Everything's fine in the hangar, sir.

145
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,036
Nothing's out of control down here.

146
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,650
<i>Then why have
the alarms been triggered?</i>

147
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
<i>It's just a drill, a safety drill, sir.</i>

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,570
Safety check occurs at 0600.
Who authorized this drill?

149
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,110
Uh...

150
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:22,870
We are decrypting the alien hardware, sir.

151
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,490
Standard operating procedure.

152
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,330
That didn't work.

153
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,000
Who is this? What's your CT number?

154
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,630
<i>Trooper, identify yourself!</i>

155
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,800
Okay. How about this?

156
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,970
No, no, no, no, no.

157
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,270
That's gonna leave a mark.

158
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,700
I'm going down there.

159
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:10,710
Got it. I got it. It's easy.
Just level your hands.

160
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,300
What, are you crazy?
You could've gotten us killed.

161
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,220
Not to mention
ruining our hopes of flying this mission!

162
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,470
It's a malfunction, no harm done.

163
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,560
Explain this. Now.

164
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,990
Sir, we were decrypting the enemy craft

165
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:35,320
when what appears to be
an enemy booby trap went off.

166
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,150
A booby trap?

167
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,900
Yes, sir. The fighter went haywire

168
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,240
and had I not been able to get control
of it, and aim the missile at the doors,

169
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,660
something worse might've happened.

170
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,910
Is this true?

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,250
Yes, sir. That is what happened, no doubt.

172
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,210
Well, Captain Rex,
looks like I was correct.

173
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,670
The Umbaran fighters are dangerous

174
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,260
and not fit for flight.

175
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,600
But, sir, we now know how they work.
We just need practice!

176
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,640
Lock down these fighters.

177
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,810
I don't want anything else exploding.

178
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,310
Nice work.

179
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,940
Now we know how to fly them,
and we won't be able to get near them.

180
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,990
Oh, come on. That won't stop us.
It's just procedure.

181
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,080
We can sneak in and be out
before Krell knows anything.

182
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,500
I thought the plan was to destroy
the enemy ship with the fighters,

183
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,290
not blow up our own hangar.

184
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,960
Look, I agree we should
go through with this.

185
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,420
So, are you two volunteering
to be my pilots or what?

186
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,930
I'm in regardless of the consequences.

187
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,020
Flying these fighters beats
blindly walking into a bunch of missiles,

188
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,520
so, I'm in. We just need a plan.

189
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,060
Already got one.

190
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,520
General Skywalker blew up a droid
control ship when he was just a kid.

191
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:00,150
And he told me the trick was hitting
the main reactor from the inside.

192
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,320
Oh.

193
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,740
Well, that won't be so tough.

194
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,160
I want a full perimeter sweep.

195
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,500
Be on high alert.

196
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,760
Fives, what are you doing out here?
You should be in the barracks.

197
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,260
I found my pilots.
We're going after that supply ship.

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,470
Are you out of your mind?

199
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:29,510
It's a suicide mission,
not to mention against orders.

200
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,570
It's the right thing to do.

201
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,390
We have to try.

202
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,480
It sounds like you intend
to go through with it.

203
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,940
If you're going to try to stop us,
we need to know.

204
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,860
I can't help you when you get caught.

205
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,500
I understand, sir.

206
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,080
Hey. Hey, Tup.

207
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,540
Wake up!

208
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,170
What? I'm trying to sleep.

209
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,130
Where are they?

210
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,960
- Who?
- You know.

211
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,470
Don't tell me
they're going to disobey orders.

212
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,560
Well, I didn't say that.

213
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,100
You know we have to tell the General.

214
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,610
No. No, no, no, you can't.

215
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:03,730
We have to tell him.

216
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,250
If we know what they're up to,
and we keep our mouths shut,

217
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,030
then we'll be complicit
in their insubordination.

218
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,080
Do you really want to be court-martialed?

219
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
Look, sir!

220
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,110
These things are trickier
than I imagined.

221
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,470
I hope this is a good idea.

222
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,480
Well, it's better than Krell's plan.

223
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,770
I'm only doing this
because I don't like him.

224
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,480
That's reason enough.

225
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,610
I'm just doing it for fun.

226
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,580
Whoa! What the...

227
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,770
Try to fly steady. We're going in!

228
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,710
I'm really not liking this.

229
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,700
Easy, Hardcase.
Don't get an itchy trigger finger.

230
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,850
Looks like they think
we're Umbaran, all right.

231
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,810
There's the supply ship! Follow me!

232
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,690
Let's do this.

233
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,530
Captain, my flight officer reports
the launch of three starfighters.

234
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,910
I thought I ordered
those ships locked down.

235
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,790
Sorry for the confusion, sir.

236
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,790
I authorized the recon of the delta

237
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,250
in preparation
for your attack on the capital.

238
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,420
You took it under your own authority
to launch such a reconnaissance?

239
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,420
Oh, yes, sir. I'm sure the report
will make your strategy more effective.

240
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,180
I want that report
as soon as they are back.

241
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,600
Hey, where are you two going?

242
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,110
I asked you a question, troopers.

243
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,820
We are going to speak
with the General, sir.

244
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,570
Regarding what?

245
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,820
A personal matter.

246
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,120
Why don't you tell me,
and I'll report it to the General?

247
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,830
On second thoughts,
sir, it's not important.

248
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,630
Yeah, that's what I thought.

249
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:25,310
Okay. Break time is over. Get back to work.

250
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,350
Hey!

251
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,730
Clones? Intruders!

252
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Uh... Sir, there are clones
in the main hangar.

253
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:43,790
Impossible.
The probability of that is 10,003 to 1.

254
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why do they have
to go and do that?

255
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:07,560
Uh, sir, we have confirmed that
there are three commandeered starfighters

256
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,100
heading toward the main reactor.

257
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,440
Strengthen our defenses.

258
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,910
Reactor core locked, prepare missiles.

259
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,610
Fire missiles!

260
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,750
Activate ray shields.

261
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,950
Roger, roger.

262
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,040
Ray shields. Hit the deck!

263
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,210
This may have been a bad idea after all.

264
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,630
Intruder alert!

265
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,090
Our shields are sure taking a beating.

266
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,220
We can't turn back now!

267
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,480
Cover me!

268
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,730
Hardcase! Get back on your ship!

269
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,560
Trust me! I've got a plan!

270
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,700
This is for the 501st! Don't wait for me!

271
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:03,250
Hardcase! No!

272
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,330
You've disobeyed enough orders today, sir.

273
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,330
Follow this one. Get out of here!

274
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,170
If I know Hardcase, we'd better leave.

275
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,390
Live to fight another day, boys.

276
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,530
Live to fight another day.

277
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,650
Come on. Come on!

278
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,100
They did it.

279
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,980
Where's Hardcase?

280
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,150
He didn't make it.

281
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,400
We couldn't have done it without him.

282
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,410
General Krell would like to see them
in the tower.

283
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,130
You want to see them, sir?

284
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,340
Indeed.

285
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,050
It seems they have accomplished
a very brave act.

286
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,430
Unfortunately, they've also
committed a serious crime

287
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,020
by directly disobeying my order.

288
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,190
With all due respect, sir,

289
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,190
the order to attack the cargo vessel
was mine.

290
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,610
If there's a punishment to be given,
it should be directed toward me.

291
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm their commanding officer.

292
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,490
General, sir, Captain Rex is attempting
to take the blame

293
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,886
for actions that were clearly mine.

294
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,910
Fives!

295
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,960
I request that his admission of guilt
be denied and full blame placed upon me.

296
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,210
Oh, do you?

297
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,130
You willfully countermand my direct order,

298
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,460
and now you have the audacity

299
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:27,680
to request who should bear the punishment
of your insurrection?

300
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:32,890
Let me be clear about the punishment
for the treason committed by ARC trooper

301
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:34,310
5555,

302
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,020
and CT-5597.

303
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,310
They will be court-martialed,
they will be found guilty.

304
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,610
And they will be executed!

305
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,030
Make no mistake.

306
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:50,450
For crossing me,

307
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,740
you will pay the price.
