1
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,950
<i>Divided by war,</i>

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,550
<i>in an effort to end the Galactic conflict,</i>

3
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>the first ever sanctioned meeting</i>

4
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,830
<i>between the Republic
and the Separatists will be held.</i>

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,460
<i>And Mandalore is chosen
as neutral ground</i>

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,590
<i>for these precarious meetings.</i>

7
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:38,140
<i>Tensions run high as many hold hope
for these important negotiations.</i>

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,010
The Republic recognizes
the tragedy of war.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,060
But there is nothing we can change
that has already occurred.

10
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,310
Say it aloud before this gathering,

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,940
as representative for Chancellor Palpatine,
that you declare without reservation

12
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,320
the Separatist State legitimate.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,950
I have something to say
about the legitimacy of the Separatists.

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,870
Why is Lux Bonteri here?

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:06,830
What could he possibly have to say?

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,170
He was not invited.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,130
You didn't mention that Lux Bonteri
would be here.

18
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,840
I didn't know.

19
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,520
I stand before you, son of Mina Bonteri,

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,350
loyal Separatist, a patriot, a friend.

21
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,110
It has come to my attention
that my mother was murdered

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,360
by Count Dooku in cold blood.

23
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,410
That is a lie!

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,530
Remove this traitor immediately.

25
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,080
I will not be silenced.

26
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,720
Stop this!

27
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,710
We would ask you to respect
that we deal with this matter ourselves.

28
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,090
No! Dooku is deceiving you.

29
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,050
You will all be betrayed
just like my mother.

30
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,800
I apologize for such a rude interruption.

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,300
Please let us continue.

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,770
We can't just let them take him.
He'll be killed.

33
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,900
Do what you can, Ahsoka, but be discreet.

34
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,360
<i>Those are some rather strong
accusations you have levied against me.</i>

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,810
You know what you did, Dooku.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,360
<i>Do I? I've done a lot of things, young man.</i>

37
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,610
<i>And choose to remember them
in order of importance.</i>

38
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,330
<i>The death of your mother
seems to have escaped me.</i>

39
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,450
I will have my revenge.

40
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,210
<i>I think it is time we reacquaint
the young senator with his mother.</i>

41
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,790
<i>Kill him.</i>

42
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,310
Ahsoka?

43
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,560
Lux, I think it's time to go. Don't you?

44
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,660
Artoo, fire up the engines. We're leaving.

45
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,990
Run.

46
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,330
Hurry! Hurry!

47
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,840
- Ahsoka, I appreciate your help, but...
- Keep moving.

48
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,840
Captain Taggart,
we've got incoming clankers.

49
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,220
We'll cover you, sir.

50
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,210
<i>Ahsoka, Padmé just contacted me.</i>

51
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,580
<i>She told me the peace negotiations
have all but collapsed. Where are you?</i>

52
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,210
I'm en route to Coruscant, Master.
I have Lux Bonteri with me.

53
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,880
Master Jedi, I'm sorry
if I've caused you any trouble.

54
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
It's nothing.

55
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,630
You will be safe now with the Republic.

56
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,180
<i>All right.
Bring Bonteri to Coruscant immediately.</i>

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,760
<i>We'll discuss giving him amnesty.</i>

58
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,060
Yes, Master.

59
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,770
- I can't go with you, Ahsoka.
- What?

60
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,490
I told you, I have a plan.

61
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,360
Shooting me is not going to be part of it.

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,700
What are you doing with a gun anyhow?
You're not a fighter.

63
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,740
I'm no longer a Separatist either.

64
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,340
I won't join the Republic.

65
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,620
What other options do you have?

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,910
There is a different way.

67
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
I understand everything
that you've been through.

68
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,290
I understand you feel alone.

69
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,790
But the Republic will help you.

70
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,590
Like they helped my mother?

71
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,010
I've already made contact
with a group on Carlac

72
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,470
who are noble
and are allied with my cause.

73
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,640
And what cause is that?

74
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,220
To kill Dooku.

75
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,770
The only one you're going to get killed
is yourself.

76
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:43,020
I'm sorry, but I'm taking you to Coruscant.

77
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,610
You're plan hasn't exactly been
well thought out, Lux.

78
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,110
Without me, how did you think
you were going to escape those droids?

79
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
Like this.

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,950
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

81
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,800
It seems Ahsoka is quite exhausted.
She probably should sleep it off.

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,610
Lux?

83
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,570
Where are my lightsabers?

84
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,330
Lux!

85
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,330
Artoo, take a look around
and see if you can find where Lux hid them.

86
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:44,670
I'm going to have a little chat
with Mr. Bonteri.

87
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,810
Lux! Lux, where are we?
And what did you do with my lightsabers?

88
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,100
You should've stayed on the ship.

89
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,910
Hey, kid. You're late.

90
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,120
Death Watch.

91
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,590
Did you get us what we need?

92
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,050
Yes, I have the information with me.

93
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,010
Who's this?

94
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,560
I'm his...

95
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm his betrothed.

96
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,940
Right. Right.

97
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,780
Betrothed?

98
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,490
Little skinny, isn't she?

99
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,320
She serves her purpose.

100
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,000
We leave now.

101
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,620
The snow is coming.

102
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,580
What have you gotten us into?

103
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,500
It's all under control.

104
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,920
These are the Death Watch.
They're Mandalorian terrorists.

105
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,610
- They'll kill us both.
- Are you coming?

106
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,260
Yes.

107
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,930
Uh, I should stay with the ship.

108
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,390
No. You're coming, too.

109
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,790
The boss will see you in there.

110
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,510
Don't ruin my plan, okay?

111
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,350
Plan? What plan?

112
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,850
This is a holotrace device.

113
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,140
It can identify the origin
of any holo transmission.

114
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,860
I knew if I accused Dooku of murder,
I would be brought to face him.

115
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,900
Well, it worked.

116
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,400
And I now know Dooku's exact location.

117
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,570
If Death Watch moves quick enough
we can destroy him.

118
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,570
Is that enough of a plan for you?

119
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,410
This is not some
idealistic political group!

120
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,040
They will take the
information and kill you.

121
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:09,960
I knew you wouldn't understand.

122
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,880
The Death Watch are murderers!
Sworn to destroy Jedi.

123
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,130
You don't know what you're doing! This...

124
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,670
Am I interrupting something?

125
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,890
No. Of course not. We were just...

126
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,020
It's time to talk business.

127
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,480
Tell your woman to leave us.

128
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,310
Of course.

129
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,820
Now, give me what I want.

130
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,950
When I know that you will use it correctly.

131
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,330
Don't toy with me, boy.

132
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,240
You see this scar?

133
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,370
It was a parting gift from Count Dooku.

134
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,210
If you question my resolve
to destroy him again,

135
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,590
I will give you one just like it.

136
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,760
This device will tell you his location.

137
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,050
Good. That was painless, wasn't it?

138
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,680
Now, let's celebrate.

139
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,110
Repair these droids

140
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,530
so we can use them
for target practice again.

141
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,500
Please reassemble us.

142
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:42,800
We are battle droids no longer.
Now we are slaves.

143
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,140
Please reassemble us.

144
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,070
Try that again and I will...

145
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,670
You don't want to make them angry.
They are far from rational.

146
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:12,080
Believe me, you have no idea.

147
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,790
- What's your name?
- Tryla.

148
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm Ahsoka. Where are you from?

149
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,380
We were kidnapped from a nearby town.

150
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,690
We are a simple people. We trust easily.
And we were betrayed.

151
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,390
We feast. Prepare the food.
Your masters are hungry.

152
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,540
Hungry?

153
00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:00,380
Careful not to choke on your stupidity.

154
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,590
I see your woman has fit in well.
Now, how will you fit in?

155
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,050
All I want is Dooku dead.

156
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,440
Vizsla.

157
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,730
Chieftain Pieter,
I don't remember summoning you.

158
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,570
You have taken our women, stolen our food
and threatened us for too long.

159
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,570
Brave for you to come here
with such bold words.

160
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,240
You are no longer welcome here.

161
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,550
Well, if our presence here isn't welcome,
we'll make ready to leave.

162
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,670
And you'll return our people to us?

163
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,100
Yes, sunrise tomorrow. You have my word.

164
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,760
Very well. We'll be waiting.

165
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,610
You see? They're not the butchers
you make them out to be.

166
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:27,460
You have kept your word.

167
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,220
We are very grateful
for your understanding.

168
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,310
I am a man of my word.

169
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,480
Here is your granddaughter, as promised.

170
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,570
- No!
- Tryla!

171
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,650
Kill them. Kill them all.

172
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:58,750
No! Our village. Run for your lives!

173
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:07,630
Save them, Ahsoka. Save them.
Save my people.

174
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,130
Why? What are you doing?

175
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,390
Never let the weak tell you what to do.

176
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,560
Welcome to Death Watch.

177
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,550
Now what do we have here?

178
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,640
I think we've caught ourselves a Jedi.

179
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,940
Drag her back to camp.

180
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:21,380
Thank you, friend. How can we repay you?

181
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,310
Rescue your friends. How?

182
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,440
I compute.

183
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,940
I will prepare the others.

184
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,700
Now, Lux Bonteri,

185
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,970
this does not look good.
This does not look good at all.

186
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,790
I asked you to join us in good faith
and you bring a Jedi into our camp.

187
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,380
She wasn't meant to be here.
Please let her go.

188
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,970
I'm afraid that's not an option.

189
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:21,470
I believed you had honor,
but you're just murderers.

190
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,510
No better than Dooku.

191
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,480
You call us murderers?

192
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:29,440
And yet it was your own lust for revenge
that made you seek us out.

193
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,810
I wanted justice for my mother's death.

194
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,480
And you shall have it.

195
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,820
But the Jedi are no different from Dooku

196
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:40,360
and this one shall pay in part
for their crimes against Mandalore.

197
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:44,160
So you see it's not murder at all.
It's like you say.

198
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,410
It's justice.

199
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,170
Ahsoka, now!

200
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,210
Thanks, buddy.

201
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:03,930
Stop! The Jedi is mine.

202
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,280
Lux, get to the ship.

203
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,870
I guess Artoo made some friends.

204
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,740
Not bad, Jedi.

205
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,790
I didn't miss.

206
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,380
Ahsoka!

207
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,090
Don't let them escape.

208
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,380
That's two I owe you.

209
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:55,520
No one followed us. God job, Artoo.

210
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,560
What do you mean
the escape pod has been activated?

211
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:02,860
Lux! Artoo, the ship is yours.

212
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,700
Lux. Lux, what are you doing?

213
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,120
I can't go with you, Ahsoka.

214
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,580
You know that.

215
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,840
But we can try...

216
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,550
Try to change things together.

217
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,720
We make a pretty good team, don't we?

218
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,430
Don't worry. We'll meet again. I promise.

219
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,320
Be careful, Lux.
