1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,202
The final surge!

2
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:21,441
Having learned
of warlord Poggle the Lesser's plot

3
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,481
to rebuild a Separatist droid foundry
on Geonosis,

4
00:00:24,522 --> 00:00:27,721
Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,

5
00:00:27,842 --> 00:00:30,680
prepare to assault
this heavily fortified installation.

6
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:34,680
Their mission,
destroy the factory at all cost.

7
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:36,519
Anticipating stiff resistance,

8
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,519
Republic commanders send
Jedi Master Luminara Unduli

9
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,078
and her Padawan, Barriss Offee,
to reinforce the attack.

10
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,798
But time runs short for our intrepid heroes

11
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:48,278
as the dreaded droid mill
nears completion.

12
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:55,076
Captain, the only safe landing zone
is south of Skywalker's position.

13
00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:56,276
Yes, General.

14
00:00:57,916 --> 00:01:01,275
Barriss, I assume
you've made the necessary preparations.

15
00:01:01,396 --> 00:01:03,555
Precisely as you instructed, Master.

16
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:07,355
Buckle your belts and
check your cells, soldiers. We're going in.

17
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,591
This bridge is our first waypoint.

18
00:01:22,713 --> 00:01:26,112
Focus your fire on the gun emplacements,
here and here, because it's only...

19
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:28,151
Because it's only
after we neutralize the guns

20
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:31,031
- that we can push for the factory.
- I was...

21
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:34,870
Yes, we can push for the factory.
Now, expect stiff resistance from...

22
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:38,269
And don't forget to top off
your energy cells and ration packs.

23
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,909
Once we leave, there'll be no resupply.
Anything else, Ahsoka?

24
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:45,108
No. I think you've pretty much
covered everything

25
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,708
in my briefing.

26
00:01:47,269 --> 00:01:49,108
Very well. Squad dismissed.

27
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:53,907
Okay. What's next?

28
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,506
You know, Master,
my briefings might go better

29
00:01:56,627 --> 00:01:59,506
if you didn't interrupt me
every time I tried to...

30
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,586
I wasn't interrupting.
I was trying to help you.

31
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:06,145
Which I would appreciate,
if you didn't interrupt me to do it.

32
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,785
I just think maybe you don't trust me
to give the briefing.

33
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,584
It's not about trust.
It's about getting the job done right.

34
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:14,664
So you don't trust me
to get the job done right! I knew it!

35
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:18,943
- Snips, I never said...
- No. No, it's okay. I understand.

36
00:02:19,024 --> 00:02:21,462
I'm the Padawan, you're the Master.

37
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:30,221
Good day, General.
Skywalker's waiting for you.

38
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:35,501
At it again, are they?
Again, Master?

39
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,620
Let's just say that they have a penchant
for playing loose

40
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,100
- with regulations and rules of command.
Yeah, but when I say it,

41
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:43,099
- they actually listen to me.
- Well, if you don't trust me,

44
00:02:49,619 --> 00:02:51,737
we do have a factory to destroy.

45
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:56,177
Well, Barriss?
Aren't you going to introduce yourself?

46
00:02:56,298 --> 00:02:59,337
Padawan learner Barriss Offee
at your service.

47
00:03:03,697 --> 00:03:05,895
Glad to meet you. I'm Ahsoka.

48
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:10,215
It's good to see both of you again.

49
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:13,734
I wish it was
under more peaceful circumstances.

50
00:03:22,374 --> 00:03:25,413
A frontal assault is risky.
Our losses will be high.

51
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:28,012
But not as high as they'll be
if that factory comes online.

52
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:30,612
Indeed, but there is an alternative.

53
00:03:31,173 --> 00:03:34,211
Every Geonosian building has a series
of catacombs beneath it

54
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:35,651
that run deep underground.

55
00:03:36,171 --> 00:03:38,690
Some of the tunnels are close enough
to this cliff wall

56
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:41,290
so that you could cut a hole
and make an entry point.

57
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:43,650
Once inside,
we could find the main reactor,

58
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,689
plant the explosives
and blow the factory inside out.

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,409
Well, looks like a good way to get lost,
if you ask me.

60
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,168
For the unprepared, perhaps.

61
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,647
But I have instructed Barriss to memorize
the labyrinth, all 200 junctions.

62
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,887
You always were thorough.

63
00:03:57,968 --> 00:04:00,807
It pays for one to be prepared.
Right, Barriss?

64
00:04:00,928 --> 00:04:03,807
Especially when other people's lives
depend on your success.

65
00:04:04,047 --> 00:04:08,206
How do we keep the Geonosians occupied
while someone else is setting the bombs?

66
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:11,765
Good point, Snips. If whoever is going
in there is going to be successful,

67
00:04:11,806 --> 00:04:13,085
we'll need to create a diversion.

68
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:17,284
Precisely. That task will be carried out
by you and I, Skywalker,

69
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,364
while the destruction of the factory
falls to the Padawans.

70
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:24,363
Now, hold on. Who decided that?
Walking into that factory could be suicide.

71
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,683
Not if you and I are successful
holding Poggle's attention at the bridge.

72
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:31,402
Master, I can do this!
I've had riskier assignments.

73
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:34,561
But unlike Barriss,
you aren't prepared for this mission.

74
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:39,401
Not to worry, my Padawan is reliable.
She can lead them both through the maze.

75
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:41,200
We'll be in and out, Master.

76
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,600
See? Dependable Barriss
will get us through.

77
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:48,639
Don't worry, Master.
As you well know, I can follow orders.

78
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,599
It's decided, then.

79
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,199
I guess it is.

80
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,238
We'll monitor your progress
on these chronometers.

81
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,598
Synchronize on my mark. Three, two, one,

82
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,477
mark.

83
00:05:04,278 --> 00:05:06,716
Let's get going. After you, Barriss.

84
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,395
You feel Ahsoka is not up to the task?

85
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:20,195
- I never said that.
- What is it, then?

86
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:23,513
Nothing. Let's prepare the men.

87
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,672
We'll have to make a bold move
if we're to draw them out of the factory

88
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,912
and keep their attention on us
and not the Padawans.

89
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,592
The best way to do that is to
march our troops straight up the middle,

90
00:05:36,673 --> 00:05:38,992
parade style. They can't resist that.

91
00:05:39,352 --> 00:05:42,671
- With no cover?
- Well, we have to make it tempting.

92
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:49,550
The factory is operating
at 50% production capacity.

93
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:52,589
We have 10 garrisons of new droids
ready to deploy.

94
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,548
No, the Super Tanks are not ready,

95
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,428
but when they are,
the Republic forces will be routed.

96
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,147
They have no weapon
that can penetrate its heavy armor.

97
00:06:14,187 --> 00:06:18,705
Here come the droids. Everybody steady.
Steady. Keep marching.

98
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:22,305
I hope the Padawans have made it
past the bridge by now.

99
00:06:34,463 --> 00:06:38,502
- That looks like a lot of droids.
- Well, it is a droid factory.

100
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:41,541
As long as we can destroy them
faster than they can make them,

101
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:42,941
we'll come out on top.

102
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,701
I love
your simple logic, Skywalker.

103
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:46,821
Here we go!

104
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,060
Let them fall into the trap.

105
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,897
You may now commence attack.

106
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:49,211
- Nice work. Well, here goes nothing.
- I should go in first. I know the way.

107
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:51,610
Be my guest.

108
00:08:27,246 --> 00:08:30,204
- They're sleeping.
- We have to find another way.

109
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,044
We don't have time.
This direction is the fastest.

110
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,564
- Maybe you're wrong.
- Trust me.

111
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:50,361
Ahsoka. Ahsoka!

112
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,076
They should have entered the catacombs
by now.

113
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:23,956
I sure hope they're not lost down there.

114
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:27,795
Left at the next junction.

115
00:09:31,595 --> 00:09:33,914
Dead end.
- If we make a wrong turn,

116
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:38,073
we may never find our way out.
You do remember the way, don't you?

117
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,353
Of course I do.

118
00:09:43,354 --> 00:09:45,192
It's not left. It's up.

119
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:47,952
It's this way.

120
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,269
- Rex! A little help here.
Get up there, trooper!

121
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:23,426
My lord, I beg you
to let us use the secret weapons.

122
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:29,305
We have 20 units ready now
and many more on the way.

123
00:10:32,826 --> 00:10:33,984
Thank you, my lord.

124
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:37,744
Deploy the Super Tanks. Attack formation.

125
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:52,621
- Looks like the Separatists have a new toy.
- Rex, pick your targets.

126
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:55,141
Yes, sir. Elevation 427.

127
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,699
Whoa! That's a lot of droids.

128
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,619
Come on.
The main control room is this way.

129
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:21,617
Steady. Steady. Fire!

130
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:37,015
Our shields are holding.
They can't touch us.

131
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,414
That's a relief.

132
00:11:41,655 --> 00:11:45,013
- Sir, nothing could withstand that.
- They must be ray-shielded.

133
00:11:47,654 --> 00:11:49,652
This is it. We're here.

134
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:04,770
Two Jedi in the control room?
That is impossible.

135
00:12:04,852 --> 00:12:06,570
How could they have gotten past security?

136
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,169
And now, we make ourselves scarce.

137
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:26,167
Green light. The bombs are active!

138
00:12:26,848 --> 00:12:29,247
- The Padawans did it.
- And just in time!

139
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,526
Fire!

140
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:35,246
Get down!

141
00:12:52,603 --> 00:12:54,122
You heard His Highness.

142
00:12:54,163 --> 00:12:57,202
Collect their pathetic little bombs,
then we will kill them.

143
00:13:06,761 --> 00:13:08,720
See if your stupid tank can take this.

144
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:11,320
Fool.

145
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,199
The Super Tank is impervious
to all weapons.

146
00:13:36,517 --> 00:13:39,075
Rex! Tell the men to fall back!

147
00:13:39,116 --> 00:13:42,315
But, sir, you can't be asking us
to turn tail and run!

148
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:44,194
I'm not asking you to run, Rex.

149
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,954
I wanna draw those tanks out
onto the bridge.

150
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:51,873
- I see what you have in mind.
- I always come prepared, Master. Let's go!

151
00:13:57,033 --> 00:13:58,272
The bombs!

152
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:11,070
Stupid green bugger!

153
00:14:29,229 --> 00:14:30,587
Fall back! Fall back!

154
00:15:03,543 --> 00:15:05,022
Give everything you've got.

155
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,178
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

156
00:15:42,896 --> 00:15:45,935
Where are they? Those bombs
are gonna go off any second now.

157
00:15:46,577 --> 00:15:48,775
Rex, any sign of Ahsoka or Barriss
on your side?

158
00:15:49,335 --> 00:15:51,694
No, sir.
But this place is getting ready to blow.

159
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:54,694
The evacuation ships are arriving.
I suggest you get on one.

160
00:15:54,895 --> 00:15:58,573
- Not without Ahsoka.
- My Padawan will not fail.

161
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,812
Ahsoka, can you hear me?
Ahsoka, where are you?

162
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:15,850
Where did she go?

163
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,688
- The bugs took the bombs.
- What are we gonna do now?

164
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:31,248
I don't know what to do
without the bombs.

165
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:35,208
Well, this tank could destroy
the power generator,

166
00:16:36,049 --> 00:16:40,967
- and probably us along with it.
- I guess that's our only choice.

167
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:43,686
Master, can you hear me?

168
00:16:44,687 --> 00:16:48,286
- Master!
- Ahsoka, set off the bombs! We're trapped!

169
00:16:48,766 --> 00:16:52,485
- I'm sorry, Master. We can't make it out.
Can't make it out?

170
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,924
- Ahsoka, wait!
Fire!

171
00:17:14,883 --> 00:17:16,761
Get down! Get down!

172
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,239
Ahsoka.

173
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,559
Ahsoka! Can you hear me? Come in!

174
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,957
- Master Luminara, don't worry.
- Be at ease, Skywalker.

175
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:40,637
At ease? We need to act now!

176
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:43,397
Ahsoka and Barriss may still be alive
down there.

177
00:17:43,518 --> 00:17:46,837
There's not enough time.
I sense them drifting away.

178
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,396
No. We'll get them out.

179
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:59,634
The tank lifters are here to move
the debris as ordered, General.

180
00:17:59,675 --> 00:18:01,274
Get to it, Rex.

181
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,912
- How deep do you think we're buried?
- It's probably best not to think about it.

182
00:18:15,193 --> 00:18:16,951
Hand me that power cell, would you?

183
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:23,670
- Thanks. Mind holding the light?
- Whatever you're doing, I hope it works,

184
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:28,230
because I'd sure rather have died fighting
up there than starve to death down here.

185
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,709
Don't worry, we'll run out of air
long before we starve.

186
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,669
That's a comforting thought. Thanks.

187
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,548
Master Skywalker has taught me
a trick or two.

188
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:40,868
I think I can get
this communicator working.

189
00:18:47,507 --> 00:18:49,866
We cannot abandon our Padawans.

190
00:18:49,908 --> 00:18:53,706
You misjudge me.
I, too, care for my apprentice.

191
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:58,225
- But if their time has come...
- I refuse to let Ahsoka die.

192
00:18:58,305 --> 00:18:59,905
She will find a way out.

193
00:19:00,466 --> 00:19:03,984
If my Padawan has perished,
I will mourn her,

194
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:06,663
but I will celebrate her as well
through her memory.

195
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:11,063
Well, I still plan on celebrating this victory
with my Padawan, in person.

196
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:15,662
What happens to us now doesn't matter.
By destroying this factory,

197
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:21,421
- we've saved countless lives elsewhere.
- Well, I'm about to save two more.

198
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:30,860
Wait. I'm picking up a pulse
on Ahsoka's comm channel.

199
00:19:31,181 --> 00:19:32,540
It's coming from over there.

200
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:37,859
Master, I know you're up there,
and I know you're looking for me.

201
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,497
- I'll move the heavy machinery over, sir.
- No time!

202
00:20:00,776 --> 00:20:02,455
Someone's digging!

203
00:20:16,694 --> 00:20:18,493
- Barriss!
Ahsoka!

204
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:25,251
I knew they were still alive.
I told you we shouldn't give up on them.

205
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,290
It's not that I gave up, Skywalker,

206
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:32,530
but unlike you, when the time comes,
I am prepared to let my student go.

207
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,530
Can you say the same?

208
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,928
- I knew you'd come looking for me.
- I never doubted you for a second.

209
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:46,808
- Padawan, you did well.
- Thank you, Master.

210
00:20:46,849 --> 00:20:49,567
But if it weren't for Ahsoka,
we'd still be down there.

211
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:54,687
Indeed.
Your Master never lost faith in you.
