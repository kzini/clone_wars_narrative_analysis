1
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,510
<i>Pursued by pirates!</i>

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,940
<i>While on a rite of passage,</i>

3
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,770
<i>six Jedi younglings
and Ahsoka Tano are ambushed.</i>

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,410
<i>Protecting the young Jedi,</i>

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,510
<i>Ahsoka was captured by
the nefarious Hondo Ohnaka</i>

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,080
<i>and taken to the planet Florrum.</i>

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,250
<i>Marshalling their courage and training,</i>

8
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,926
<i>the younglings infiltrated
the pirate stronghold</i>

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,220
<i>and rescued Ahsoka.</i>

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,290
<i>Now we find our heroes
in a race to their starship,</i>

11
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,060
<i>with the pirates closing in.</i>

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
I know. I see them.

13
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,310
They're gaining on us!

14
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,430
Uh, I think they're still
upset that we tricked them.

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,070
They'll get over it
once we're off their planet.

16
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,080
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

17
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,087
Right.

18
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:28,610
Ganodi, we need a quick evac.

19
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,710
Come in, please.

20
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,080
Ganodi.

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,880
Maybe the pirates
are jamming the signal.

22
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,550
Where could she be?

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:37,560
Ganodi. Huyang. Come in.

24
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,900
Attaching your head took a lot longer

25
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,200
than I thought it would.

26
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,176
This is appreciated, youngling.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,700
Mobility is paramount,
especially in an emergency.

28
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,126
<i>Ganodi, where are you?</i>

29
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,146
I'm here.

30
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,970
I was in the back fixing Huyang.

31
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,140
<i>Great. That's great.</i>

32
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,480
But we're all gonna need repairs

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,086
if you don't have the engines running.

34
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,380
Where are you?

35
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,750
Ganodi, it's Ahsoka.

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,766
Padawan Tano!

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,050
We've rescued you.

38
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,320
Almost.

39
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,020
But we need you to get us home.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,037
Are you ready?

41
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:11,560
Just tell me what I need to do.

42
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,760
Okay, fire up the engines
and head to these coordinates.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,160
We'll be right there.

44
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,760
There they are!

45
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,410
R2, hold her steady
and lower the boarding ramp.

46
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,570
Come on!

47
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,890
Looks like our ride is here.

48
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,390
Everyone get topside and stay down.

49
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,500
But who's going to pilot the tank?

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,070
Katooni, grab that mask.

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,440
Uh, that'll have to do.

52
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,960
The steering must have come loose.

53
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,940
We got him!

54
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,280
Hang on!

55
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,350
Oh, no.

56
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,290
No, no, no!

57
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,850
They're coming back!

58
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,470
R2, get out of there now!

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,140
Everyone, let go!

60
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,410
Jump down now.

61
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,030
Nice try, little Jedi.

62
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,800
But it looks like you're coming with us.

63
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,130
What the...

64
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,370
Droids?

65
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,540
It's an invasion.

66
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,870
Boss! Boss!

67
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,970
We're all in trouble!

68
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Gah!

69
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,450
Hondo.

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,550
General Grievous, I presume?

71
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,380
What a surprise.

72
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,450
Have a seat.

73
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,020
What, may I ask, is the honor?

74
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:33,730
You can dispense with
the pleasantries, pirate.

75
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,330
This planet is now under
Separatist control.

76
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,476
Uh-huh.

77
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,730
And what do you suppose that means?

78
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,740
It means you have
a new master, pirate scum.

79
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,750
<i>Hondo Ohnaka, we meet again.</i>

80
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,650
<i>As I recall the last time
we met face-to-face,</i>

81
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,890
<i>I was your prisoner.</i>

82
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,960
Uh...

83
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,820
<i>And you attempted to barter me off</i>

84
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,360
<i>to the highest bidder.</i>

85
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,530
But can you blame me?

86
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
I mean, a Sith Lord.

87
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,470
What a handsome price
you would...

88
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,800
<i>Silence!</i>

89
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,800
<i>You are going to pay the price
for your treachery.</i>

90
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,470
Well, I'm a reasonable man.

91
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,486
Name the price.

92
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,510
I'm sure we can reach...

93
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,880
<i>There will be payment,
but no deals...</i>

94
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,450
<i>only demands.</i>

95
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,350
<i>Your entire arsenal will be melted down.</i>

96
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,850
<i>Everything you own is now property</i>

97
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,790
<i>of the Separatist Alliance.</i>

98
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,390
Now you go too far!

99
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,000
Unacceptable!

100
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,730
This is an outrage.

101
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,860
This...

102
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,877
Hold on.

103
00:07:36,901 --> 00:07:38,430
We can make a deal.

104
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:41,530
This is not good business!

105
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,870
This isn't good.

106
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,680
Those scrappin' droids
are looting the place.

107
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,780
They're dismantling our ships.

108
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:51,580
The fact that Grievous is here
with his entire fleet

109
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:54,250
means that Master Kenobi
must have been overrun.

110
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,750
This entire system is now
in Separatist controlled space.

111
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,250
What should we do?

112
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,450
There's nowhere to run.

113
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:03,160
You're not running anywhere, skug.

114
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,130
You're still my prisoner.

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,800
Maybe I can trade you to the Separatists

116
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,830
in exchange for my freedom.

117
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,600
Not likely.

118
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,870
Grievous didn't come here to make deals.

119
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,670
He already controls the planet
and the system.

120
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,180
If you hand us over to him,

121
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,310
he'll kill us and then you.

122
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,380
We have a common enemy in Grievous.

123
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,620
Together, we can get out of this.

124
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,720
You must have
some other ships somewhere.

125
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,020
You are pirates.

126
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,330
Hondo's got a private fleet,

127
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,000
but only he knows where the ships are.

128
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,260
Then we'll have to rescue him.

129
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,030
I know Grievous.

130
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,500
And I know droids.

131
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,200
With my help, you stand a better chance.

132
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,580
You got yourself a deal, Jedi.

133
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,710
Halt.

134
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,580
You captured this tank?

135
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,610
Not bad for an astromech.

136
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,080
What's your ID number?

137
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,560
Hey, do not get smart with me.

138
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,590
I outrank you.

139
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,270
You just watch yourself.

140
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,250
I could have you melted down
with the rest of this junk.

141
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,440
That's right.

142
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,880
Now take it over to Hangar 12.

143
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,010
And no detours.

144
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,810
We'll be watching you.

145
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,070
Jedi.

146
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,240
And here I thought
you made your escape, no?

147
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,610
No.

148
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,620
There were complications.

149
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,680
Now, we have to put
our differences aside

150
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
and be friends,

151
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,890
or else we're all gonna die here.

152
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,750
Ah, very diplomatic.

153
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,920
Ha!

154
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,890
I knew you did not come back
to rescue Hondo,

155
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,030
how do you say it?

156
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,330
Out of the goodness of your hearts.

157
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,976
No, no, no, no.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,800
You need something from me.

159
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,770
A ship, to be specific.

160
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,040
Ah, yes.

161
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,370
A ship, a ship.

162
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,110
Ah, but where would we find
one of those?

163
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,820
My new friend General Grievous
has destroyed my ships.

164
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,180
We know you have one,

165
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,590
a whole pirate fleet.

166
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,020
And one of my old friends, apparently,

167
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,130
has been talking too much.

168
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,830
Ah, what does it matter?

169
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,370
We'll never reach the vault anyway.

170
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,900
Grievous' army is way too big.

171
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,917
Don't give up.

172
00:11:06,941 --> 00:11:08,140
We can fight.

173
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,570
If I may, sir.

174
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,310
I have instructed younglings
for over 1,000 generations,

175
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,120
and these are among the best
I have ever seen.

176
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,680
Well, then, show me.

177
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,420
Show me your swords, tiny Jedi.

178
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,860
Show Hondo you are ready to fight.

179
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,860
Ah.

180
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,130
And you, child.

181
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,000
Where is your saber?

182
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,700
It's not finished.

183
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,000
I never finished it.

184
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,570
I've done everything right,

185
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,910
but it won't work.

186
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,140
You must trust

187
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,540
that the components
that form your lightsaber

188
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
are meant to be together.

189
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,180
There is no other way.

190
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,826
It is the Force that binds them.

191
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,390
Yes, I was just going to say that.

192
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,397
Finish it now.

193
00:11:50,421 --> 00:11:51,590
Finish, finish!

194
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,560
This is worth the price of a ship.

195
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,590
To see the construction
of a Jedi lightsaber,

196
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,500
this... this is priceless.

197
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:01,630
Finish it,

198
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,800
and together, we can defeat Grievous.

199
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,740
Oh.

200
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,010
Amazing.

201
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,150
That is truly amazing.

202
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,560
Well, cut me down, little Jedi.

203
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,830
It's time to leave.

204
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,210
So why the big show?

205
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,186
You didn't really have a choice.

206
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,050
You know we have to work together.

207
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,920
Because, Jedi,

208
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:53,550
you know what we are about to
attempt is very dangerous.

209
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,490
And I may be a pirate,

210
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,490
but I do not like
taking children into battle.

211
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,000
That didn't seem to bother you
when you attacked us.

212
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,830
Well, today is a new day,

213
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,940
and lucky for you, today,

214
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,440
I like children.

215
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,270
Now, let's free the rest of my men.

216
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,150
<i>This is OOM-87, General.</i>

217
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,290
<i>The prison area is under attack.</i>

218
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,860
<i>There are several miniature Jedi here.</i>

219
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,160
What?

220
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,090
You aren't making any sense.

221
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,300
What Jedi?

222
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,460
<i>The little ones,</i>

223
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,160
<i>half the size of normal Jedi.</i>

224
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,630
<i>They're freeing the prisoners
and...</i>

225
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,730
<i>my knees!</i>

226
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,070
Prepare to open fire.

227
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,880
We will bring the building down
on their heads.

228
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,530
I got your back.

229
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,800
Great.

230
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
I feel so safe.

231
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,490
They run.

232
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,506
Quickly.

233
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,530
After them.

234
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,140
They went the wrong way.

235
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,780
Don't worry.

236
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,710
What about the others?

237
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,440
We can't just leave them.

238
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,910
You are welcome to come, small one.

239
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,950
You may join our merry band of pirates.

240
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,880
I won't just run away.

241
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,990
Ahsoka trusted you.

242
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,350
We all trusted you.

243
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
R2, do something.

244
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,447
I don't know.

245
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,010
We have to shake Grievous off.

246
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,840
Get aggressive. Ah!

247
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,206
Too aggressive.

248
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,960
Far too aggressive.

249
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,780
Yes, well, it was an effective strategy,

250
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,850
but not what I would recommend.

251
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,110
So many lightsabers
to add to my collection.

252
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Hurry!

253
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,976
Come on!

254
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Run.

255
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,100
All of you run!

256
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,550
Ha!

257
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,506
Ahsoka!

258
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:09,507
Come on!

259
00:19:09,531 --> 00:19:10,930
Ahsoka, come on!

260
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,070
You will never defeat Grievous.

261
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,770
Never!

262
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,570
I wouldn't be so sure.

263
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:30,880
Did we get him?

264
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,910
I can't tell.

265
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,620
Show is over, kiddies.

266
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,890
Let's get out of here.

267
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,590
And let me see.

268
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,230
Oh, the cost of the fuel.

269
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,460
I had to use a lot of fuel.

270
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,970
The general wear and tear
on my men and equipment.

271
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,970
A couple of them died, I think.

272
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,420
Believe me, Kenobi.

273
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,280
Staging a rescue is not
an inexpensive proposition.

274
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,380
So you mean to tell me
you were staging a rescue,

275
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:32,620
not attempting to hijack
a Jedi starship?

276
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,150
You're welcome!

277
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:36,290
Oh, the thanklessness!

278
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,760
What an accusation.

279
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:38,767
I am gone!

280
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,530
I will send you my bill!

281
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,226
Ahsoka.

282
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,690
It's good to see you're all safe.

283
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,190
Yes, Master.

284
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,460
We had quite an eventful mission.

285
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,390
The most eventful since the time.

286
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,100
Master Yoda went to find
his lightsaber crystal.

287
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,106
What?

288
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,107
Oh!

289
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:17,570
- Tell us!
- What happened then?

290
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,170
I'm afraid that story will have to wait.

291
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,780
For now, be proud.

292
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:25,310
You have survived an ordeal
few your age could.

293
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,650
Welcome home, young Jedi.
