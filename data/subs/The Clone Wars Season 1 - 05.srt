1
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,285
<i>Clone forces rally.</i>

2
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,565
<i>As the war escalates in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,199
<i>the Jedi Knights are spread thinly
across the galaxy.</i>

4
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,203
<i>Many new clones are rushed into service
to support their Jedi generals.</i>

5
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,248
<i>Unfortunately, because
of the relentless demands of battle,</i>

6
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,321
<i>many young clones must join the struggle</i>

7
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,129
<i>before their intensive training
has been completed.</i>

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,088
<i>These clones, manning a vital network
of tracking stations,</i>

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,321
<i>are all that stand
between the Republic and invasion.</i>

10
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:53,926
This is the deck officer checking in.
Nothing going on, as usual.

11
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,482
<i>You're listening to the
Grand Army of the Republic broadcast,</i>

12
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,288
<i>the voice of the Outer Rim.</i>

13
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,967
<i>This next one goes out to the mudjumpers
of the 224th slugging it out on Mimban.</i>

14
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,042
<i>Keep your heads down
and your seals tight, boys.</i>

15
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,846
Yes!

16
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:15,842
Who's next? Fives?

17
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,443
Shouldn't you be watching
your scope, Hevy?

18
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,361
Yeah! Let's take a look.

19
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,408
Hmm. What do you know? All clear.

20
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:24,924
Just like the last hundred times
I looked at it.

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,365
Personally,
I like that it's so quiet out here.

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,883
I can catch up on the reg manuals.

23
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,847
Echo! What is wrong with you?

24
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,046
We should be out on the front lines,
blasting droids.

25
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,600
Ah, leave him alone.
They kept him in his growth jar too long.

26
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,920
Yeah.

27
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,763
You may not realize it yet, Fives,

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,206
but you landed on the most boring post
in the Outer Rim.

29
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,565
And one of the most important.

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,480
Attention! Sergeant on deck!

31
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,088
At ease. Even though you're all new here,

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,446
I shouldn't have to remind you that
this quadrant is key to the Outer Rim.

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,009
If the droids get past this station,

34
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:02,399
they can surprise-attack the facilities
where we were born,

35
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,640
on our home world of Kamino.

36
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,762
There are some officers on the way,

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,399
so I want everything squared away
for inspection. Understood?

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,479
Sir! Yes, sir!

39
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,800
Still here, Anakin?
When was the last time you slept?

40
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,609
I'll sleep after we find General Grievous.

41
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,045
Clone Intelligence spotted him
in the Balmorra system,

42
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:35,008
but that was weeks ago.
Since then, he vanished.

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,719
Well, unlike you, maybe he's getting
some much-needed rest.

44
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,959
Excuse me, General.

45
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,518
Incoming transmission
from Commander Cody.

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,488
<i>General Kenobi, General Skywalker.</i>

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,526
Cody. How goes the inspections?

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,159
<i>The tracking station at Pastil
is fully operational.</i>

49
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,128
<i>Captain Rex and I are proceeding
to the outpost in the Rishi system.</i>

50
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,360
Good. Report back once you've arrived.

51
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,247
<i>Copy that. Cody out.</i>

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,048
Good man, that Cody. Don't worry, Anakin.

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,964
If General Grievous comes anywhere
near this quadrant, we'll know about it.

54
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,923
- Sir! Incoming meteor shower!
- Raise the shield.

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,964
- You wanted excitement, Hevy.
- Right.

56
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,803
Meteor shower.

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,964
What the...

58
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,204
- Get these doors open.
- Roger, roger.

59
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:08,648
CT-327, report in. Sentry! Do you copy?

60
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,006
- Interference from the meteors?
- I don't see him down there, Sarge.

61
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,240
You two, go find him.

62
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,559
Droids!

63
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,485
Sound the alarm!

64
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,804
They've disabled the beacon.

65
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,360
Get a message to the fleet!
We have to warn...

66
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,004
Sarge!

67
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,641
That should slow those buckets down.

68
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,805
- This way! Hurry!
- No! We can...

69
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,728
There's too many!

70
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,086
<i>The outpost is secure, General.</i>

71
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,640
<i>We shut down the alarm
and turned on the all-clear signal.</i>

72
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,688
Excellent. Keep that signal alive.

73
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,319
I don't want the Republic
to find out we're coming.

74
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,288
General?
Our spy on Kamino is making contact.

75
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:39,719
<i>All the preparations for your invasion
are in order.</i>

76
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,519
Good! Our fleet is
approaching the system.

77
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,403
We are almost at the rendezvous point.

78
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,599
<i>Very good, my lord.
I will await your arrival.</i>

79
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:56,806
The destruction of Kamino will stop
their production of clones for good.

80
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,123
Rishi Outpost, this is Commander Cody.
Do you copy?

81
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,959
<i>Rishi Outpost, please respond.</i>

82
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,248
Open...

83
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,127
Open comlink channel.

84
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,360
Rishi Outpost, come in!
Rishi Outpost, come in!

85
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,046
<i>Sorry, Commander.
We're experiencing technical difficulties.</i>

86
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:24,643
- This is the inspection team.
<i>- lnspection? Negative, negative.</i>

87
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,121
<i>We do not require an inspection.
Everything is fine here. Thank you.</i>

88
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,488
We'll be the judge of that.
Prepare for our arrival.

89
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,363
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

90
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,400
Something's not right here.

91
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,723
Well, good luck.
I'm putting you in charge of this one.

92
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,186
What do we do without the Sarge?

93
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,783
The reg manual says the next...
Wait. Wait!

94
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,463
Did you hear that?

95
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,099
Yeah, what is that?
It doesn't sound like droids.

96
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:21,983
- Don't forget about those giant eels.
- I've never seen one...

97
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,789
Cutup!

98
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,063
- What the hell was that?
- That was an eel.

99
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:35,108
That's why we have the regulation
not to go outside.

100
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:36,942
Let's move before it comes back.

101
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,782
Poor Cutup.

102
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,779
Look! It's Commander Cody!
It's the inspection team!

103
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,259
This is not good.
I don't see the deck officer anywhere.

104
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:05,102
These boys are sloppy.
There should always be an officer on duty.

105
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,305
We have to warn them.
Get on the comlink.

106
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,750
I have a bad feeling about this.

107
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,786
Welcome to Rishi, Commander.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,704
As you can see,
the outpost is operating at peak efficiency.

109
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,941
Thank you for visiting,
and have a safe trip back.

110
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,145
We need to inspect the base
just the same.

111
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,582
Uh, there is no need.
Everything is fine and fully operational.

112
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,623
It's no good. Their comlinks
are on a different scramble set.

113
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,621
I'll signal them with this flare.

114
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,429
- Take us to the sergeant in command.
- Roger, roger.

115
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,263
A droid attack flare!

116
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,701
Rex! What the heck are you doing?

117
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,103
Relax.

118
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:01,069
Just as I thought. Looks like
one of those new commando droids.

119
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,903
That flare must have come
from the survivors.

120
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,939
Ambush!

121
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:16,783
Ah! Those clankers
have tough armor!

122
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,989
We're cut off!

123
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,825
Off the platform!

124
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,305
Copy that.

125
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,422
No sign of them.
They must have been pulverized.

126
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,507
Resume defensive posts.

127
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,983
Well, that sure
complicates things, Commander.

128
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,947
No worse than that time on Tibrin.

129
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,942
We had Jedi with us on Tibrin.
They helped.

130
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:12,625
Hands above your heads!
Take your sun bonnets off!

131
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,740
- Sir?
- Take them off! Now!

132
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,909
Nice shot!

133
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,059
The name's Rex.

134
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,544
But you'll call me ''Captain'' or ''sir.''

135
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,302
Sir, yes, sir!

136
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,268
I'm Commander Cody, your new boss.

137
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,581
My designation is
Trooper 27-dash-5555, sir.

138
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,468
We call him Fives. I'm Hevy. This is Echo.

139
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,465
- Where's your sergeant?
- Dead, sir.

140
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,223
We're all that's left.

141
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,262
Looks like we got ourselves
a batch of shinies, Commander.

142
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,224
- ''Shinies,'' sir?
- That's right.

143
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,746
Your armor.
It's shiny and new, just like you.

144
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,226
Sir, me and my batchers
are trained and ready.

145
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,268
We'll take back our post, shiny or not.

146
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,739
There's hope for you yet, rookie.

147
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,306
Commander Cody, do you copy?

148
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,821
Captain Rex, please respond.

149
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:22,102
They should have checked in
from the Rishi station hours ago.

150
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:24,863
It appears your captain follows orders
as well as you do.

151
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,307
Hmm. Perhaps Cody is boring Rex
with standard procedures and protocol.

152
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,063
We need to work
on our own boring procedures

153
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,823
and figure out a strategy to find Grievous.

154
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,908
Right. Admiral, let me know
if you hear from Rex.

155
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,029
Look sharp, rookies.

156
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,340
As long as those tweezers
occupy this post,

157
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,625
our home planet of Kamino is at risk.

158
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,782
But there's so many of them.
Doesn't matter, kid.

159
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:57,545
We have to retake this base,
so we will retake this base!

160
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,220
How do you propose we get through
those blast doors, Rex, old boy?

161
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,619
I have a few ideas.

162
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,223
What is that?

163
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,225
Unit 2-6, is that you?

164
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,023
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

165
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,183
You sound strange. Is something wrong
with your vocabulator?

166
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,065
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

167
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:29,381
Take off your helmet.
Let me see your faceplate.

168
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,063
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

169
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,781
This is never gonna work.

170
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,460
- Clones!
- Roger, roger.

171
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,468
Right. Let's move.

172
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:51,025
- Permission to take point, sir?
- I'm always first, kid.

173
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,222
- Fives!
- He's okay. Focus on the battle.

174
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,068
- I got one!
- Sorry, Echo, I junked that one.

175
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,139
Like hell you did!

176
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,745
Get to the window.
lt looks like we have more visitors.

177
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,299
It looks like a Separatist fleet!

178
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,501
That's why they commandeered
the outpost.

179
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,581
They're mounting a full-scale invasion!

180
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,819
We have to warn command.

181
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,902
The Republic base
is still transmitting the all-clear signal,

182
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,187
but for some reason
our commando droids are not responding.

183
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:54,309
That base cannot be allowed
to alert the Jedi that we're coming.

184
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,268
Send down reinforcements to investigate!

185
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,899
Those clankers sabotaged our transmitter,
and they hard-wired the all-clear signal.

186
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,823
- It'll take time to repair...
- We don't have time. Look.

187
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,309
Well, buddy, you always said
you wanted to be in the front lines.

188
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,767
We can't protect the outpost long
against that army of clankers.

189
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,444
Then we'll destroy the outpost instead.

190
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,038
But, sir, our mission
is to defend this facility at all costs.

191
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,360
We have to warn the Republic
about the invasion.

192
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,805
They'll take notice
when the all-clear signal stops.

193
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,243
That's right.

194
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,406
When they stop receiving our beacon,

195
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,162
they'll get the message
something's wrong.

196
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,639
I need every thermal detonator
in the inventory.

197
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,802
It'll take more than a few detonators
to destroy this outpost.

198
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,565
We can use the L.T.
This moon freezes for over half the year.

199
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,369
We use liquid Tibanna as fuel
to heat the base.

200
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,123
Liquid Tibanna. Highly explosive.

201
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,963
Good. Bring the tanks here
and prime the detonators.

202
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,879
All right, listen up.

203
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:27,246
There's only one target of interest
in this sector: Kamino.

204
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,480
It's the closest thing
we clones have to a home.

205
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,561
Today we fight for more than the Republic.

206
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,006
Today, we fight for all our brothers
back home. Understood?

207
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,359
Sir, yes, sir!

208
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,244
I think we can even the odds
a bit, Commander,

209
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,486
especially since they don't know
we're here.

210
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,049
This one here is mine.

211
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,122
A big gun doesn't make a big man.

212
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,447
Reinforcements reporting. Open up.

213
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,687
You didn't say ''please.''

214
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,128
Clones! Get them!

215
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,408
We could use a Jedi about now.

216
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,288
Captain Rex, come in!
Commander Cody, are you there?

217
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,447
General, there's still no response.

218
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,448
How about the all-clear signal?

219
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,998
- Is the base still transmitting?
- Yes, sir.

220
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,480
If something were wrong,
Cody would contact us.

221
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,687
What is the status of the base?

222
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:44,961
We've run into some difficulties.
There seem to be a few clones left, sir.

223
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:49,561
Then wipe them out!
We can't let a few puny clones stop us.

224
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,885
Fall back to the op center! Move!

225
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,838
- Rex? Time's wasting!
<i>- Almost ready.</i>

226
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:07,525
The handset isn't linking up
with the detonator.

227
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,403
- Hevy?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,684
This detonator isn't working.

229
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,842
I'll take care of it. It'll be fixed
in no time. You guys get out of here.

230
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,086
Just make it fast.
Those droids are getting close.

231
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,880
There, that should fix it.

232
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,763
This isn't good.
There's got to be another way.

233
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,609
The base is ours again, sir.
The clones are fleeing.

234
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,760
The cowards. Secure the area.

235
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,998
Hevy, hit the...

236
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,166
- Where's Hevy?
<i>- I'm on it, sir.</i>

237
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,402
Hevy, get out of there!

238
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,879
The remote isn't working.
I'll have to detonate it manually.

239
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,245
Hey! Hold on, there! Blast him!

240
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,726
Hevy! We've got to get up there,
back to the maintenance pipe. Let's move!

241
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,483
It's no use! I know what I have to do.

242
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:20,520
I don't like your tone, rookie.

243
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,125
<i>Soldier, come in! Are you there?</i>

244
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,366
<i>Soldier, come in! Respond!</i>

245
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:55,800
Hevy, come in! Come in, Hevy!

246
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,923
<i>Hevy, come in!</i>

247
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,681
Do we take prisoners?

248
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,684
I don't.

249
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,719
Hevy always did hate that place.

250
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,681
The all-clear signal has been disabled?

251
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,601
The Rishi base has stopped transmitting!

252
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,679
Grievous!

253
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,648
Sound the invasion alarm.
Let's get the fleet underway.

254
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,323
I didn't tell them to blow up the station!

255
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,526
But isn't it good
that the base is destroyed?

256
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,645
Idiot!

257
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,049
The Republic fleet!
We're outgunned. Get us out of here.

258
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,840
We've got those tinnies on the run.
Thanks to Hevy.

259
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,919
Gunships!

260
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,886
On behalf of the Republic,
we thank you for your valiant service,

261
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,969
and we honor your comrade's sacrifice.

262
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,644
Your new unit is lucky to have you.

263
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,008
I'd be proud to fight beside you,
anytime, anywhere.

264
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:39,282
Congratulations.
You're not shinies anymore.

265
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:43,969
With all due respect, sir,
we failed our mission.

266
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,608
We don't deserve this honor.

267
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,806
No. If it weren't for you,

268
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,006
the Republic wouldn't have learned
of the Separatist invasion

269
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,728
until it was too late.

270
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,801
You showed me something today.

271
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,166
You're exactly the kind of men I need
in the 501st.

272
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,408
- Sir! Yes, sir!
- Sir! Yes, sir!
