1
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,590
<i>The clone war threatens
the unity of the Republic.</i>

2
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,790
<i>As battles rage across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,710
<i>more worlds succumb
to the seductive lure of the Separatists</i>

4
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,230
<i>and leave the Republic.</i>

5
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,670
<i>On a vital mission of peace,</i>

6
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:31,590
<i>Senator Padmé Amidala journeys
to the Outer Rim world of Rodia,</i>

7
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,350
<i>desperate to ensure
its loyalty remains to the Republic.</i>

8
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:36,390
<i>Senator Amidala,</i>

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,630
<i>I just received word that you have
ventured through enemy territory</i>

10
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,750
<i>into the Outer Rim.</i>

11
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,950
Senator Farr requested me personally,
Chancellor.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,110
His planet is in crisis.
His people are starving.

13
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,590
He's a very old family friend.
I could not refuse his plea for help.

14
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,110
<i>I understand,</i>

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,750
<i>but in these dangerous times, you should
be accompanied by a clone escort.</i>

16
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,750
This is a mission of peace.

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,790
I put my faith in diplomacy.

18
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,830
We can't solve all of our problems
by throwing troops at them.

19
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,230
Yousa no needing to worry,
Chancellor.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,430
- As resempative of Nab--
- Jar Jar, look out!

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:19,870
What is happening?

22
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,270
<i>May I recommend
that only those who are qualified</i>

23
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,150
<i>for these delicate peace talks
participate in them?</i>

24
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,950
I will follow your advice, Chancellor.
Thank you.

25
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,550
Lookee, lookee, it's a swamp planet
just like home. Meesa have to get going.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,710
Jar Jar, you would be doing me
a great favor by staying with the ship.

27
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,390
Meesa knowing meesa be big help
with the negotiations.

28
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,270
I need you to watch over 3PO.

29
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,030
You know how
he always gets himself into trouble.

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,110
Trouble, me?
Really.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,550
I won't be long.

32
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,390
Meesa understands, My Lady.

33
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,350
His Excellency, Ah-Twa.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,110
I've missed you so much.

35
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:33,190
I was afraid you might not come.

36
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,310
We are such a small
and humble system.

37
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:39,390
Uncle Ono,
you are very important to me.

38
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,830
We've been friends
since I was a little girl,

39
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,430
when you were my father's
strongest ally in the Senate.

40
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,830
Rodia is very important
to the Republic,

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,830
and of course I'd come to help you.

42
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,070
You speak of friendship
I have not witnessed of late.

43
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,790
Where was the Republic when our
supply ships were destroyed by pirates?

44
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,190
Where was the Republic
as my people starved?

45
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:02,310
We have been stranded out here

46
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,630
without any help at all.

47
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,310
I know it is not your fault,
but my people starve

48
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,550
all the same.

49
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,430
I'm sure the Republic Senate
will approve a relief effort.

50
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,910
The vote was postponed,
but you will get your food.

51
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,310
I am sorry.

52
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,310
It is too late, my sweet.

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,350
The Separatist leader Nute Gunray
has promised to support us

54
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,430
with a very generous relief effort.

55
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,270
He is giving us food, ships,
and protection.

56
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,270
Nute Gunray cannot be trusted.

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:40,630
He will bring war to your system
just as he did to mine many years ago.

58
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,110
I am afraid

59
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,190
I have already done
what I must for my people.

60
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,750
Viceroy, I should have known.

61
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,350
<i>You won't get away this time,
Senator.</i>

62
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,470
<i>Your friend made a deal with me,</i>

63
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,430
<i>and you are part of it.</i>

64
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,630
3PO! Come in, 3PO.

65
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,590
- <i>Stop her.</i>
- Three--

66
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,510
<i>No one can help you now.</i>

67
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,750
I am so sorry, my sweet.
I had no choice.

68
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,390
There's always a choice.

69
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,230
- To live in fear is no life at all.
- <i>Take her away.</i>

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,470
Please, Uncle Ono, don't do this.

71
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,230
<i>You have made a wise decision,
Senator.</i>

72
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,470
<i>I will be there within the hour
to bring food for your people...</i>

73
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,950
<i>...and collect my prize.</i>

74
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,750
How rude.

75
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,710
I'm afraid the local swamp life
doesn't have a very high opinion of us.

76
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,390
- Whaten dey speaking?
- I couldn't possibly repeat it.

77
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,990
Theesa swamp dwellers
just like meesa.

78
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,550
I will convince them
of our good fellowship.

79
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,030
Do be careful, Jar Jar.

80
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,670
I don't think they're quite
like your friends on Naboo.

81
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,750
Meesa make contact.

82
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,110
Oh, dear.

83
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,470
I don't think
that requires translation.

84
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,550
Thisen is a different
swamp altogether. Sorry.

85
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,030
Oh, my stars. Battle droids.

86
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,630
Weesa in trouble now.

87
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,510
Stop where you are.

88
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,030
Wait for me!

89
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,550
Jar Jar, you great webfoot,
you're squashing my circuits.

90
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,150
Blast 'em.

91
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,750
Wait, where are you going?

92
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,390
Oh, no. I'll be crushed for sure.

93
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:53,790
- Hang on, Three-so!
- It's 3PO.

94
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,710
That was close.

95
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,790
What are you doing?
Get me down at once.

96
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,510
It's not too late.

97
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,310
Uncle Ono,
you can stop this madness.

98
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,990
Keep moving, prisoner.

99
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,510
Look out, Jar Jar.
A crab droid is headed right for you.

100
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,190
Headed for meesa?

101
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,070
Yes, yousa!

102
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,990
No, Jar Jar, go to your left.

103
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,230
Behind you.

104
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,030
Watch out.

105
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,150
I can't bear to watch.

106
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,230
Oh, no. Jar Jar's been killed.

107
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,030
I knew something like this
would happen.

108
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,330
What a horrible way to die,
and it's all my fault.

109
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,650
He was so brave.

110
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,090
Now he's gone forever.

111
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:10,890
Meesa okay.

112
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,890
Jar Jar, you're alive.

113
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,090
Meesa okay, Three-so.

114
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,450
Meesa okay.

115
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,530
If you've finished messing around,
I need help.

116
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,850
- Jar Jar, kindly don't do that.
- But meesa save-ed you.

117
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,330
That's the end of our ship.
Typical.

118
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,410
Are those chains necessary?

119
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,250
Welcome to the Separatist way,
Senator.

120
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,250
Viceroy Gunray's orders.

121
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,770
I hope it's worth it to you.

122
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:57,130
Thisa one big mess.

123
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,010
Weesa going nowhere.

124
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:03,290
Perhaps we should try to
contact the clone troopers.

125
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,010
Lookee. Here's a button
that's still working.

126
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:10,050
What did you break now?

127
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,490
Meesa doing nothing.

128
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,930
Thatsa looken like a Jedi robe.

129
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,130
Whosa you supos'n this belongs to?

130
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,290
I wouldn't know.

131
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,970
But our only hope is
to hide in this closet

132
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,050
until Mistress Padmé returns.

133
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,890
If those droids attacking us,

134
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,650
Padmé's probably in trouble.

135
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,410
My Lady gave us
very specific instructions

136
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,770
to remain here.

137
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,850
Fiddlesticks.
We musta hafta try and saving her.

138
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,410
Jar Jar Binks,
have you gone completely mad?

139
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,410
You'll do more harm than good.

140
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,650
Good. I shall meet the Viceroy
when he lands.

141
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:48,770
What about
Senator Amidala's companions?

142
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:54,530
If there are no signs
of her friends,

143
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,730
they must have fled into the jungle.

144
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,610
Yes, this is perfect.

145
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,730
I want no sign of trouble.

146
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,810
Our people need those supplies.

147
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,970
Wait.
Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve.

148
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,050
- Just look at you.
- Something's wrongo here.

149
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,930
The battle droids will surely
capture you, or worse, me.

150
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,130
Not with thisa on.
Theysa won't be recognizing me.

151
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,130
- You can't be serious.
- Come on, Three-so.

152
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,530
- We can do it.
- I have a very bad feeling about this.

153
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,570
The citizens of Rodia
welcome you, Viceroy.

154
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,810
Where is Senator Amidala?

155
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,690
Awaiting your arrival as promised.

156
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,970
Excellent.

157
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,330
I do not wish to keep her waiting.

158
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,450
Shall we go?

159
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:49,970
We are holding the Senator
in the detention tower.

160
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,930
I hope it is not too painful
for her.

161
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,690
Sheesa up in that tower?
Weesa got to rescuing her.

162
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,690
And how precisely
do you propose to do that?

163
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,290
Look, a Jedi.

164
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:08,770
We're doomed.

165
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,170
- A Jedi?
- Jedi?

166
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,730
Where's a Jedi?

167
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,370
I do believe they mean you.

168
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,850
- Meesa not a Jedi.
- Kill the Jedi.

169
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,010
Don't shoot. We surrender!

170
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:20,770
Forget surrender! Weesa run!

171
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:32,530
- Is he dead?
- The Jedi got away.

172
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,570
He slipped through this grate
and went underwater.

173
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,330
Sound the alarm!

174
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,570
Find that Jedi!

175
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,650
I can see you're busy,
so I'll just be going now.

176
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,530
And take that Republic droid scum
to the dismantling center.

177
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,730
Dismantling center?
Wait, wait. I'm innocent.

178
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,850
I'm innocent, I tell you.

179
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,530
Let's find that Jedi.

180
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,650
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

181
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,850
Take me to Senator Amidala at once!

182
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,610
There's a bad boogie monster down there,
you betcha.

183
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,570
Don't be fearing, Padmé.
Meesa coming.

184
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,930
Better watch out.
There's a Jedi on the loose.

185
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,890
You know,
you will soon be destroyed.

186
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,330
I can't tell you how many times
I've seen battle droids

187
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,250
sliced in half by a lone Jedi.

188
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,450
Quiet, you.
All right, cut the chatter.

189
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,410
I want you troops to go outside
and secure the perimeter.

190
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,090
You made it. I'm rescued at last.

191
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,490
Hurry, before the battle droids
figure out what's happening.

192
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,970
- Quiet in there!
- Thank you.

193
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,610
Let's get out of here, Master Jedi.

194
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,810
Jedi?

195
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,770
There's no Jedi in here.

196
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,090
Wait, there's no prisoner in here.

197
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,770
How did she do that?

198
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,810
Where's the alarm button?

199
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,570
I am a protocol droid

200
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:46,530
- fluent in over 6 million forms of--
- Quiet.

201
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,590
3PO.

202
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,330
Mistress Padmé.
Thank The Maker you're safe.

203
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,650
Have you--

204
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,770
- Where's Jar Jar?
- I'm afraid he went to rescue you.

205
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,290
- What about the Jedi?
- There is no Jedi.

206
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:11,610
It appears the battle droids
have mistaken Jar Jar for one.

207
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,970
That's not good.

208
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,730
Hang on, My Lady.

209
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,290
This is our chance
to capture Viceroy Gunray,

210
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,930
but I need you to stay calm.

211
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,930
Go back to the ship
and call for help.

212
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,130
I regret the transmitters
on the ship are out of order.

213
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,310
What?

214
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,910
The ship has been destroyed.

215
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,730
- Battle droids?
- No.

216
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,010
- Jar Jar?
- Jar Jar.

217
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:33,530
All right,
then find a communications room

218
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,130
and send out a distress signal.

219
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Hopefully there are
some clone ships within range.

220
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,610
I'll track down Jar Jar.

221
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,300
Viceroy Gunray,

222
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,260
when can we expect
the supplies to arrive?

223
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,020
My people are starving.

224
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,860
They haven't arrived yet?

225
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,460
I'm sorry. Your request will
be taken into consideration

226
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,020
after Senator Amidala's execution.

227
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,620
Execution?

228
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
You can't.

229
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,380
She's a prisoner of war.
We were promised.

230
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,420
You are under my protection now,

231
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,820
and you will do
what I demand of you.

232
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
Padmé was right.

233
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,100
I have made a grave mistake
joining with the Separatists.

234
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,420
I know, I know.

235
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,740
We must appease Viceroy Gunray

236
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,860
so he does not destroy us all.

237
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,220
Be on alert for that Jedi.

238
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,340
He is our only hope.

239
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,850
Bring Senator Amidala before me.

240
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,530
She caused a great deal
of damage to our droids,

241
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,130
and she escaped, sir.

242
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,250
- Escaped?
- It's the Jedi!

243
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,530
- Sir.
- Shoot him!

244
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,890
Thisa rescuing is hard jobbing.

245
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:14,991
Jar Jar!

246
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,210
Capture her!

247
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,650
Oh, dear.

248
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,130
The Jedi has been spotted
in the south hall.

249
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,530
- Let's move.
- Roger, roger.

250
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,050
I think that was rather clever.

251
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,170
Sir, over there!

252
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,770
The Jedi is escaping.

253
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,010
Not likely.

254
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,130
Freeze.
Surrender.

255
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,410
Where did she go?

256
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,130
What the...?

257
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:35,229
Jar Jar... no.

258
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,610
Senator Amidala.

259
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,770
So good to see you at last.

260
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,410
Hello?
I say, is anyone there?

261
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,010
Why is there never an R2 unit
when you need one?

262
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:52,450
<i>This is a restricted frequency.
Who is this?</i>

263
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,810
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg...

264
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,170
<i>No droids.
This code is for military use only.</i>

265
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,770
This is a priority message

266
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:01,010
from Senator Amidala on Rodia.

267
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,370
- We require immediate assist--
- Hold it.

268
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,650
- Oh, dear.
- You're under arrest.

269
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,410
So you didn't find the Jedi, then?

270
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,290
You got him, boss.

271
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,010
Too bad you can't take out
that slug monster.

272
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,210
Yousa okay, bogey?

273
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:23,930
Yousa save-ed me.
Yousa my new palo.

274
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,890
Mistress Padmé!

275
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,650
Where you able to find Jar Jar?

276
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,730
I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO.

277
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,130
Not again.

278
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,690
Oh, poor Jar Jar.

279
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,770
He was always such a misfit.

280
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:45,090
I want to make sure this time.

281
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:47,050
Don't do this, Viceroy.

282
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:50,770
I beg you, do not kill her.
There must be another way.

283
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,170
Silence!

284
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:56,010
I say, I think there has been
some horrible mistake.

285
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,290
I am a protocol droid
on a diplomatic...

286
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,650
Ready.

287
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,130
Aim.

288
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,450
It's the Jedi!

289
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,450
- It's the Je-- Juh--
- Jedi.

290
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,130
Release the Senator.

291
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,530
That Jedi is going to attack.

292
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,210
Shoot him!
Shoot them all!

293
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,850
That Jedi has summoned a monster.

294
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,010
We have to get out of here.

295
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,690
I made a very good friend.

296
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,210
Hold it right there, Viceroy.

297
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,290
At last we can finish this.

298
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,610
Onaconda, it is about time.

299
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,530
Blast that Jedi and shoot her!

300
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,290
Uncle Ono, I think it's time

301
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,770
to tell the Viceroy
about our little secret...

302
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,170
how you never meant
to leave the Republic

303
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,690
and how you truly care
what's best for your people.

304
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,730
What is she talking about?

305
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,290
Sorry, Viceroy, she is right.

306
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,370
I am with the Republic,

307
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,610
and you are under arrest.

308
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,210
You will pay for this treachery.

309
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:43,610
Viceroy, you are going to
spend the rest of the war in a cell.

310
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,410
Your victory will be fleeting,
Senators.

311
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,770
Those are Republic warships.

312
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,570
The clones have arrived.

313
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,730
We got your message, General.
What are your orders?

314
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,890
My message got through.

315
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,330
Take this Separatist scum away.

316
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,050
Master Bombad,

317
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,130
on behalf of the people of Rodia,
I thank you.

318
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,210
You're either the bravest

319
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:15,010
or the most foolish Jedi
I have ever met.

320
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:17,770
I'm just a gungan,
and I don't think I'm either.

321
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,690
Well, I think
you're a little bit of both.

322
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,330
<i>Senator Amidala has brought
your people's needs to my attention,</i>

323
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:30,930
<i>and I have already sent a convoy
of supply ships to your system.</i>

324
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,530
Thank you, Chancellor.

325
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:35,850
<i>The capture of Viceroy Gunray
is a major victory for the Republic.</i>

326
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,490
<i>All of you should be commended
for your courage,</i>

327
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,290
<i>and from what I hear,
especially you, representative Binks.</i>

328
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,810
Ah, it'sa nothing.

329
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,610
Can you ever forgive me, Padmé?

330
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:51,970
It is the Republic that should be asking
your forgiveness, my old friend.

331
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:55,490
Far too often, we forget
that our most important allies

332
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,810
are not always the most powerful.
