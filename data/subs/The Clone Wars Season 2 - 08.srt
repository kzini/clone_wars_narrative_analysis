1
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,561
Victory on Geonosis!

2
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:23,962
After a massive assault, the Republic has
finally recaptured the Separatist planet

3
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:27,122
and shut down its droid factories of doom.

4
00:00:27,483 --> 00:00:32,163
An investigation by Luminara Unduli led to
the discovery of Queen Karina the Great,

5
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:36,324
whose hive mind
could reanimate dead Geonosian soldiers.

6
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:38,565
During the destruction
of the Queen's temple,

7
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,765
the Jedi apprehended
her advisor, Poggle the Lesser,

8
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:45,766
and now prepare to deliver the villain
to Coruscant for trial.

9
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:57,248
- I'm afraid we have a complication.
- Don't we always?

10
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:00,609
I've just received a distress signal
from our forces on Dantooine.

11
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,249
Master Windu's defenses held,
but at a great cost to his men.

12
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,330
They need medical supplies immediately.

13
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:09,611
We can obtain these supplies at
the medical station near Ord Cestus.

14
00:01:09,692 --> 00:01:14,052
We're delivering Poggle to Coruscant,
and Cestus is not exactly on the way.

15
00:01:14,093 --> 00:01:16,732
The Republic must begin
debriefing Poggle right away

16
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:19,133
if we're to get useful intelligence from him.

17
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:23,374
Master, I suggest we let our Padawans
handle the supply mission.

18
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:26,534
Whatever needs to be done, Master,
I'm happy to help.

19
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:29,935
- As am I.
- Very well. Take a medical frigate.

20
00:01:30,016 --> 00:01:31,815
And after we've delivered Poggle
to Coruscant,

21
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:34,576
we'll rendezvous with you
for the voyage to Dantooine.

22
00:02:05,944 --> 00:02:09,783
Sorry, boys. Hope I didn't interrupt
any pleasant dreams.

23
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,824
We got another mission, sir?

24
00:02:11,864 --> 00:02:16,024
You bet. We're making
a medical supply run to Ord Cestus.

25
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:20,305
Thought we were bred
for battle, not running errands.

26
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:24,026
Hey! We were bred
to follow orders, Pulsar.

27
00:02:24,507 --> 00:02:26,227
You got a problem with that?

28
00:02:26,267 --> 00:02:30,747
- No, sir. No problem.
- That's what I thought. Now, move!

29
00:02:36,029 --> 00:02:39,549
Scythe, come on.
Up, brother, up and at 'em.

30
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,391
Hey, Scythe.
Welcome back to the land of the living.

31
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,312
Thank you, sir.

32
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,237
We are ready to make our jump,
Master Fisto.

33
00:03:19,358 --> 00:03:21,518
Good. I look forward to your arrival.

34
00:03:46,243 --> 00:03:48,003
What? What is it?

35
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:53,243
It's too quiet. It's a big change
from all the fighting the last few days.

36
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:58,285
- You should enjoy this peace while it lasts.
- I can't. Let's go eat.

37
00:04:51,136 --> 00:04:53,816
I was just thinking
about what you said earlier,

38
00:04:53,856 --> 00:04:56,776
about enjoying the peace while it lasts.

39
00:04:56,858 --> 00:05:00,057
As a Jedi,
I'm not sure I know how to do that.

40
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,978
Master Windu has said we are
keepers of the peace, not warriors.

41
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:07,899
However, once the war is over,
it will be our job to maintain the peace.

44
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:18,701
I don't have all the answers, Ahsoka.
Like you, I am a learner.

45
00:05:19,422 --> 00:05:23,542
- What does your Master tell you?
- Anakin? Oh, um...

46
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:28,863
You might find some of his thoughts
on the future a bit radical.

47
00:05:28,904 --> 00:05:30,464
Really? Why?

48
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:34,464
Let's just say my Master
will always do what needs to be done.

49
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:37,344
I'm not even sure
how peacetime will agree with him.

50
00:05:43,627 --> 00:05:45,466
Just came up to check on us, Scythe?

51
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:49,307
Well, we're on course,
and all systems are green.

52
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,228
What the...

53
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,388
We have control of the bridge.

54
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,950
Evening, Ox, Edge.
Would you like to join us?

55
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,031
Is something wrong,
troopers?

56
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,192
Troopers! Stand down!

57
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,395
What are you doing?

58
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:31,395
Two clones just attacked us.
What is going on?

59
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:33,676
Trap, do you know
what happened to those troopers?

60
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,236
Couldn't tell you, Commander.
I'm just as confused as...

61
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:39,318
You're in charge of those men!
Did you order them to kill us?

62
00:06:39,438 --> 00:06:41,358
No, sir! I did not.

63
00:06:41,838 --> 00:06:44,558
What's happening?
Why would they do this?

64
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:46,758
We don't know. We heard shots.

65
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,359
Why should we believe you?

66
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,519
Look, no guns.

67
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,481
These men wouldn't just attack us
without reason.

68
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:04,882
My Master had a clone betray them once,
a traitor who was paid off by Ventress.

69
00:07:05,003 --> 00:07:09,203
It can't be that simple.
At least, it didn't feel like that.

70
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:12,844
Excuse me, sir, we should make sure
that we're still in control of the bridge.

71
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,484
Bridge, this is Barriss. Respond.

72
00:07:15,605 --> 00:07:18,485
We need to get up there.
We need to find out what's going on.

73
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:20,726
But these two
will be coming around any minute.

74
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:22,966
Havoc can watch them
until we check on the bridge.

75
00:07:23,087 --> 00:07:24,567
Okay. Let's go.

76
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:38,209
The cargo ship failed
to check in on schedule.

77
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,209
I attempted to contact them.
There is no reply.

78
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:43,730
I don't like it. Something's up.

79
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:47,451
It is certainly most unlike either Padawan
to lose contact.

80
00:07:47,892 --> 00:07:51,452
- They're in trouble.
- Anakin, have faith in your Padawan.

81
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:52,892
She would have checked in.

82
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:55,293
- Like you always do?
- Good point.

83
00:07:55,414 --> 00:07:58,493
Sometimes I don't think you realize
how alike you two have become.

84
00:07:58,534 --> 00:08:02,014
We need to continue
our interrogation of Poggle.

85
00:08:02,054 --> 00:08:05,534
Yes, agreed.
He's being most uncooperative.

86
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:12,576
- Keep your ears open in case Ahsoka calls.
- Got it.

87
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:25,018
Engage the autopilot
and put up the security shields.

88
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,859
Someone doesn't want us going up there.

89
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,540
I'll attempt to override the controls.

90
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,421
He's infected!

91
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:45,822
Get this thing off me!

92
00:08:51,145 --> 00:08:53,504
What is that?

93
00:08:53,545 --> 00:08:57,505
Looks like some type of parasite.
It must be controlling their actions.

94
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:01,106
Mind control.
Well, that explains a lot.

95
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:04,466
Trap was my friend.
He would never have tried to kill us.

96
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,947
How did these things get on board
in the first place?

97
00:09:08,429 --> 00:09:11,347
They must have infected the clones
while they were on Geonosis.

98
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,948
We'll have to quarantine the ship.

99
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:16,909
We should also contact Master Fisto
and let him know about the situation.

100
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,229
Let's go.

101
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,391
- That sound. It's...
- Geonosian.

102
00:09:37,874 --> 00:09:39,513
We have to help him.

103
00:09:44,756 --> 00:09:45,914
It's too late.

104
00:10:14,002 --> 00:10:15,680
Barriss! Let's go for the vent!

105
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,405
I'll go to the reactor room
and disable the thrusters.

106
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:37,565
You head for the aft comm center
and send a warning to Master Fisto.

107
00:10:37,606 --> 00:10:39,805
We have to stop the ship
from reaching the medical station.

108
00:10:44,168 --> 00:10:47,167
I don't know, Barriss.
I think we should stay together.

109
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:51,047
As do I. Unfortunately,
that's not a luxury we have right now.

110
00:10:51,169 --> 00:10:52,968
One of us must succeed, Ahsoka.

111
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,609
If you need to, you'll do
what must be done. I know it.

112
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,689
Yes. Of course. Then I'll see you soon.

113
00:11:06,972 --> 00:11:10,732
As long as these things are on board,
we dare not dock with the medical station.

114
00:11:10,853 --> 00:11:12,612
You must bring the ship in.

115
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:15,693
The only way we can stop these parasites
is to analyze them.

116
00:11:15,814 --> 00:11:19,493
You don't understand how terrible
these things are. What if they get loose?

117
00:11:19,614 --> 00:11:21,414
We will take precautions.

118
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:25,094
I have a bad feeling about this,
Master Fisto,

119
00:11:25,736 --> 00:11:27,375
but I will follow your instructions.

120
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,460
If there's one thing we clones know,
it's how to stop a Jedi.

121
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,341
NO!

122
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,303
Almost got it.

123
00:12:05,744 --> 00:12:10,024
Cargo ship TB-73, this is
Clone Captain Rex. Please respond.

124
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:14,224
Rex, this is Ahsoka.
Boy, am I glad to hear your voice.

125
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:18,266
Likewise, sir. I've got someone here
who wants to speak with you.

126
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,146
Ahsoka, what's going on? Are you okay?

127
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:23,306
Well, not exactly.

128
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,549
Make sure you have a wrist com.
Keep it on.

129
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,270
I'm going to interrogate Poggle.
He might have some answers.

130
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,630
Find Barriss and wait for my signal.

131
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:46,831
Barriss, you're back. Were you successful?

132
00:12:50,473 --> 00:12:52,553
Barriss? What's wrong?

133
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:55,353
Barriss, no!

134
00:12:59,515 --> 00:13:03,594
I'm your friend! Barriss, snap out of it!

135
00:13:11,437 --> 00:13:15,997
Barriss, it's not you, it's the creatures!
Fight them!

136
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:34,241
Leave us.

137
00:13:36,922 --> 00:13:39,001
You will answer my questions.

138
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:43,082
Your feeble Jedi mind tricks

139
00:13:43,164 --> 00:13:46,683
do not work on Geonosians.
The other Jedi already learned this.

140
00:13:49,765 --> 00:13:51,404
Mind tricks?

141
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:57,765
I don't need mind tricks to get you to talk.

142
00:13:59,927 --> 00:14:05,087
I will never talk, Jedi.
- We'll see about that, Poggle.

143
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,735
- I made contact with Ahsoka.
- What's their status?

144
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:49,136
Geonosian parasites
have infected her crew.

145
00:14:49,216 --> 00:14:50,696
How did they get on board her ship?

146
00:14:50,737 --> 00:14:52,656
Poggle said the parasites
must have needed a new host

147
00:14:52,777 --> 00:14:54,377
after we raided the Queen's temple.

148
00:14:54,417 --> 00:14:56,017
You interrogated Poggle?

149
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:59,858
I did. There wasn't time
to get the rest of you.

150
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:02,538
How did you get him to talk?

151
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,539
Look, all that matters is that
he told me how to stop the worms.

152
00:15:12,342 --> 00:15:14,101
This is Ahsoka. Come in.

153
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:18,421
Ahsoka, listen to me.
The worms are affected by the cold!

154
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:21,062
Cold? That's how we stop them?

155
00:15:21,143 --> 00:15:22,942
Rupture the coolant system.

156
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,664
Did you hear me?
Rupture the coolant system!

157
00:15:29,745 --> 00:15:31,464
The coolant system. Got it.

158
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:16,753
That's Ahsoka's ship.
It just came out of hyperspace.

159
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,434
Send out the tugs to help guide them in.

160
00:16:23,236 --> 00:16:25,035
Warn all medical hazard crew

161
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:29,076
that I don't want anyone boarding
that ship until the parasites are contained.

162
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:32,157
Sound all the alarms.
And prepare the sub-zero conduits.

163
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,959
Engage tractor beam.

164
00:16:54,602 --> 00:16:57,761
There you are.
You can't hide from me.

165
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:13,484
The bridge. At last.

166
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:23,727
We're coming in awfully fast.
This is Ahsoka Tano, can you hear me?

167
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,887
I'm shutting down the engines.
I'll try to reverse the...

168
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:33,969
I'm having a hard time slowing her down.

169
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,289
There's no one at the controls!
The pilot must be dead!

170
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,970
- Sir, she's listing.
- The escort ships must maintain control.

171
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,413
Kill me. Please.

172
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:54,773
I can't.

173
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:20,218
Full power! Now! Now!

174
00:18:27,901 --> 00:18:30,900
We got her. We got her!
Attach the sub-zero conduits.

175
00:18:31,222 --> 00:18:34,140
- The temperature is below freezing, sir.
- Let's board, then.

176
00:18:34,262 --> 00:18:37,341
But stay on guard.
They may still be dangerous.

177
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,345
Hello, Master Fisto.

178
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,706
We're ready to pick up the supplies.

179
00:19:01,428 --> 00:19:05,107
We'll take care of that.
You rest now, Ahsoka.

180
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,189
It's all right, Ahsoka. It's okay. You're safe.

181
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,550
Barriss?

182
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:22,071
Barriss is fine, thanks to your efforts.

183
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,751
And so are the clones.

184
00:19:24,232 --> 00:19:28,712
- What were those things?
- I think I can help answer that.

185
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:32,153
We had the parasite worms analyzed.

186
00:19:32,234 --> 00:19:36,313
They are the same type of creature
you found on Geonosis, Master Skywalker.

187
00:19:36,395 --> 00:19:38,753
We'll have to inform the troops
on Geonosis.

188
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:42,275
This parasite might explain how
they recaptured the planet the first time.

189
00:19:42,355 --> 00:19:44,235
I don't want it happening again.

190
00:19:44,316 --> 00:19:46,715
You've been through quite an ordeal,
little one.

191
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,676
Master Skywalker, may I have a word?

192
00:19:55,358 --> 00:19:58,158
Master, on the ship, Barriss was

193
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,238
gone,

194
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:02,999
and she wanted me to kill her.

195
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,119
- She told me...
- But you couldn't do it.

196
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:10,961
No. No, I couldn't. But should I have?

197
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:15,121
I mean, it worked out now,
but if we had failed,

198
00:20:15,202 --> 00:20:18,002
if the ship docked
and the worms spread and...

199
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,163
Ahsoka, it's your duty
to save as many lives as you can.

200
00:20:22,243 --> 00:20:25,123
Barriss knew you could save thousands
if the worms were destroyed.

201
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:28,164
Which she thought
meant destroying her, too.

202
00:20:28,525 --> 00:20:30,404
But you did the right thing.

203
00:20:30,765 --> 00:20:33,325
You knew the freezing cold
would kill the worms.

204
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:38,726
Letting go of our attachments
is a difficult struggle for all of us.

205
00:20:38,807 --> 00:20:41,086
You followed your instincts.

206
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,607
I'm sure she would agree
that you made the right choice.
