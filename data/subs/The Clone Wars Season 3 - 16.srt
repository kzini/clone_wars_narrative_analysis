1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,280
Mystery on Mortis!

2
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,800
Sent to discover the origin
of a mysterious distress call,

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,790
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,750
are stranded on a distant planet.

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,810
There, they discover three beings
more powerful with the Force

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,260
than any Jedi have seen before.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,560
A father keeps a fragile balance
between his daughter,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,880
who allies with the light side,

9
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,970
and the son,
who drifts ever closer to the dark.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:48,270
With his strength failing, the father asks
Anakin to stay and take his place,

11
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:51,400
preserving the balance
between light and dark.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,320
But after passing a perilous test,
Skywalker refuses.

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,370
Now, we find our heroes
about to depart for their journey home.

14
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,530
Or so they think.

15
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,510
Anakin.

16
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,680
Anakin.

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,350
Anakin?

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,360
It's true, what they say.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,160
You are the Chosen One.

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,490
Join me.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,040
Together we can change
the balance of the universe,

22
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,250
my friend.

23
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,170
You must know
I will never join the dark side willingly.

24
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,880
How simple you make it.

25
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,050
Light and dark,
as if there is one without the other.

26
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,350
Aligned, you and I can restore balance
wherever we go.

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,270
Peace to the universe.

28
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,020
By becoming a Sith?

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Never!

30
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,750
We will destroy the Sith!

31
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,570
And the Jedi.

32
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,340
Were you having a nightmare?

33
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,590
Something like that.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,800
If you're done napping,
I could use a little help here.

35
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm coming.

36
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,770
Leaving so soon?

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,150
Not without this, you won't.

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,440
Ahsoka!

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,150
- What's going on?
- The son took Ahsoka.

40
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,110
What in the blazes are you talking about?

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,450
Move! Let me fly!

42
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,460
Look out!

43
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,100
I didn't think you saw it.

44
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,100
It was a giant tower! Of course I saw it!

45
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,530
Any sign of him?

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,080
No. But I think it's obvious
where he's taken her.

47
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,330
- We must hurry.
- Anakin, this wasn't a mistake.

48
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,880
He brought us here for a reason.
We must not get involved.

49
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,670
Any conflict here could have dramatic
repercussions for the universe at large.

50
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,760
I don't care. He's too powerful for Ahsoka.
I won't leave her alone.

51
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,650
We are in the middle of something
we don't truly understand.

52
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,850
We'd be wise
to confer with the father first.

53
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,520
There's no time.

54
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,110
This is what he wants, to divide us.

55
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,320
It's my fault he took her!

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,110
You must feel how strong this part
of the planet is with the dark side.

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,110
The father will know what to do.

58
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,950
He can't help us.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,540
You cannot keep me here!

60
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,580
You hear me?

61
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,130
Save your energy.

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,420
You have been left to die.

63
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,260
Then I will escape!

64
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,840
Impossible.

65
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,720
I have been here for more years
than I care to remember.

66
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,770
I am a Jedi. We don't give up easily.

67
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,810
Jedi?

68
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Hm.

69
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,570
But so young. Where is your master?

70
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,280
He will come for me.

71
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,830
And if he does not?

72
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,200
He will!

73
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,950
What makes you so sure?

74
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,500
Thank you.

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,380
The chains.

76
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,880
The chains are the easy part.

77
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,400
It's what goes on in here that's hard.

78
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,770
Don't you see, child?

79
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,140
You are alone now.

80
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:23,990
If you are to survive,
you must forget your master.

81
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,900
I don't think I...

82
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:28,990
Ow!

83
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,410
What have you done?

84
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,870
You are mine now.

85
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:59,310
Anakin, always on the move.

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,310
How do I even find the father?

87
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,710
You are growing stronger, my son.

88
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,080
Am I, Father?

89
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,130
Vanity, however,
is getting the better of you.

90
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,960
How so?

91
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,220
You have done what is forbidden.

92
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,390
You have chosen the dark side

93
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,020
and allowed it to feed your anger
and desire for power.

94
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,980
By bringing the Chosen One here,
you've shown me my potential.

95
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,950
You've only yourself to blame.

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,650
Do not do this, Son.

97
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,200
Do not become what you should not.

98
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,160
Be strong, I implore you,

99
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,330
or else I will be forced to contain you.

100
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,410
You look frail, Father.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,750
I am not dead yet.

102
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,340
Well, perhaps I am tired of waiting!

103
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,230
I hate you!

104
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,930
Father!

105
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,510
We will leave him to rest.

106
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,250
I must talk to him.

107
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,760
- Not until he's stronger.
- But your brother is losing himself

108
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,090
to the dark side.

109
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,680
He's taken our friend.

110
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,760
Then he must have his reasons.

111
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,220
The same reason he had for
attempting to murder your father?

112
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,930
He would never do such a thing.

113
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,480
But I saw him.

114
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,060
It is not his fault.

115
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,810
My nature is to do what is selfless,

116
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,650
but my brother's will always be
to do what is selfish.

117
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,410
Then know you must help us.

118
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,570
I cannot interfere
with the ways of the Force.

119
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,910
My father forbids it.

120
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,840
Your brother will flee this place
and wreak havoc on the universe.

121
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,460
You and Anakin combined
have the power to stop him.

122
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,750
Come with me.

123
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,810
I can go no further.

124
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,300
When you reach the altar,
it will give you what you need.

125
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,930
I don't understand.

126
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,490
He who wields the blade
will be able to control my brother.

127
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,360
Ahsoka.

128
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,660
Ahsoka!

129
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,910
It's me. You're safe now. Let's go.

130
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,250
Are you proud of me, Master?

131
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,330
What?

132
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,606
Of course, Snips.
Of course I'm proud of you.

133
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,920
Now let's get out of here.

134
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,880
He's right.

135
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,840
Right about everything.

136
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,270
You must join him.

137
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,730
He only wants what's best for the universe.

138
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,100
Hey, what's wrong with you?

139
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,360
Always with the criticism, Master.

140
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:01,820
Never really believing in me, trusting me.

141
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,360
Well, I don't need you anymore.

142
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,330
Ahsoka. Ahsoka, listen to me.

143
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,990
He has done something to you.
Snap out of it!

144
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,370
- This isn't you, Ahsoka!
- Isn't it?

145
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,540
I feel more like myself than I ever have.

146
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,590
He asked me to give you a message.

147
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,210
He said if you don't join him,

148
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,300
he will kill me.

149
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,140
I won't let him.

150
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,850
Then you will be forced to kill me!

151
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,420
Sister! What a pleasant surprise.

152
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,670
And you brought a friend.

153
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,800
What have you done, Brother?

154
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,380
Done?

155
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,560
I have done what is right.

156
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,140
Or what is wrong,
depending on your point of view.

157
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,890
Our father is dying.

158
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,730
Did you do it?

159
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:22,860
He is just so selfish
and was taking too long to die,

160
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,110
so I decided to move things along.

161
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,740
Now, why are you here?

162
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,950
I won't let you leave this planet.

163
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,290
You are not strong enough
to keep me here.

164
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,250
Not alone, she isn't.

165
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,090
Are you referring to your friend,
the Chosen One?

166
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,840
You might want to check up on him.

167
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,550
He's a little preoccupied right now.

168
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,350
I don't want to fight you, Ahsoka.

169
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,110
And now the student will kill the master.

170
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,950
Getting ahead of yourself,
aren't you, Snips?

171
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,700
Don't call me that!

172
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,290
I hate it when you call me that!

173
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,800
Two Jedi. Finally, a challenge.

174
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,810
Can you feel it, Sister?

175
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,660
Can you feel the anger?

176
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,570
The hate? The fury?

177
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,490
Their conflict is feeding you, isn't it?

178
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,490
I must stop them.

179
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,240
No!

180
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,340
If you will stand in my way,

181
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,010
then I guess we must fight.

182
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,030
- Any suggestions?
- Yes! We cut her free!

183
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,580
- What is that?
- It can kill the son.

184
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,540
Where did you get that?

185
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,080
Give it to me!

186
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,690
You don't have to do this!

187
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,900
Then stand aside!

188
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,120
I can't.

189
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,570
I won't!

190
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,950
Stop this!

191
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,580
So glad you could make it
to our little party, Father.

192
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,670
You will stop this!

193
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,010
You are too weak for me, old man.

194
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,480
You mean nothing to me anymore.

195
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,370
Anakin! Now!

196
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,710
Everything has transpired
exactly as I planned.

197
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,840
You showed them the altar?

198
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,890
I am sorry, Father.
I didn't know how else to stop him.

199
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,350
Give it to me, child.

200
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,680
Ahsoka, no.

201
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,030
Thank you.

202
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,530
Your usefulness has come to an end.

203
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,540
No!

204
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,370
The Jedi have brought me the dagger,

205
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,330
and you have brought yourself.

206
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,590
Now, Father,

207
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:38,380
you will die.

208
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,550
Father!

209
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,520
Why?

210
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,290
My daughter, what have I done?

211
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,250
Do not hate him, Father.

212
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,790
It is his nature.

213
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,600
No!

214
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,720
All is lost.

215
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,140
The balance has been broken.

216
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,100
I thought by bringing you here I would...

217
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,930
But I have destroyed everything.

218
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,980
Can you help her?

219
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,270
There is no light.

220
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,900
The evil has been unleashed,
and the dark side shall consume her.

221
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,610
You must help her!

222
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,950
I cannot undo what is done.

223
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,490
There is no hope.

224
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,950
Yes, there is! There's always hope!

225
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,820
Then let my daughter's last act

226
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,490
be to breathe life into your friend.

227
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,970
Hey, Snips.

228
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,680
What's going on?

229
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,980
Uh...

230
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,480
Not much.

231
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,810
It's good to see you.

232
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,490
As the balance in this world crumbles,

233
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,700
so shall war escalate in your galaxy.

234
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,660
As my son has descended
into the dark side,

235
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,370
so have the Sith gained strength.

236
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,870
- We will stop your son.
- No!

237
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,210
You must go, now!

238
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,010
He needs your ship to leave the planet.

239
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,720
You must leave before he can take it.

240
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,230
What about you?

241
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,470
I shall mourn all that I have done

242
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,150
and all that is yet to be.
