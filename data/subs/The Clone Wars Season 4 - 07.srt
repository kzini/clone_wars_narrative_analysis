1
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,280
<i>War in the Expansion Region!</i>

2
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,410
<i>As the Separatists tighten their grip
over vital but isolated supply routes,</i>

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,620
<i>the Republic launches a lightning strike</i>

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>into a remote, ghost nebula,
to control the strategic system of Umbara.</i>

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,130
<i>Republic forces smash
through the Separatist blockade</i>

6
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:37,140
<i>in an effort to claim the shadowy world.</i>

7
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,490
Masters Krell and Tiin will be
supporting my troops in the south,

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,860
while Anakin's battalion comes in
from the north

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,940
and takes out enemy reinforcements.

10
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,110
It is imperative
that we conquer the capital city

11
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,490
as quickly as possible,

12
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,150
and hold it.

13
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,530
Our biggest problem
is gonna be the local militia.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,990
The Umbarans have aligned themselves
with the Separatists

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,160
and are heavily armed.

16
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,540
ARC Trooper Fives will be
assisting my units on special assignment.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,750
Ready to do my part, General Skywalker.

18
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,540
- Nice to have you on board.
- Just like old times, Rex.

19
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,220
Remember, Anakin, Cody and I will be
12 clicks to your south.

20
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,630
We're counting on you
to take out those local fighters,

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,850
or, I'm afraid,
the capital will never surrender.

22
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,390
Does my battalion
have to do everything?

23
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,100
You seem to always volunteer.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,110
All right, let's go!

25
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,730
There's a lot of surface fire.

26
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,440
They ain't got nothing we can't handle,
sir.

27
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,620
- You hanging in there, Tup?
- So far so good, Captain.

28
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,740
<i>General Skywalker,
I've turned the lights out.</i>

29
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,910
Our night vision sensors
are having a tough time in this chop.

30
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,880
I hope we don't overshoot the landing site.

31
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,250
Just get us as close as you can.

32
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,170
Time to lock and load!

33
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,290
- After them, boys!
- All right!

34
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,260
- Let's go!
- Let's do it!

35
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,090
Go, go! Go, go, go!

36
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,340
Give it to them!

37
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,510
Go, go, go!

38
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,300
Take them out! Take them all out!

39
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,140
That's the stuff!

40
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,980
Incoming!

41
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,070
That's it.

42
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,200
Give it to them!

43
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,750
Let's go, let's go!

44
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,210
Go, go! Go, go, go!

45
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,760
The planet has a ridge
at 23 degrees, north-northwest.

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,680
Good. We can use it as a staging area.

47
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,390
That's it!
Take them around the right.

48
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,770
Keep moving. We've gotta claim that ridge.
The other battalions are counting on us.

49
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,430
Let's go!

50
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,240
Don't stray too far.

51
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,490
The enemy could have
the whole place rigged with traps.

52
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,160
I can't even see the enemy!

53
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:19,380
That's why they're called
the Shadow People, Tup.

54
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,670
Everybody, take cover!

55
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,670
Go, go, go!

56
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,220
Look, it's just a vine.
Keep moving, Hardcase.

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,680
Yeah, I got it all under control.

58
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,740
That's not right!

59
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,980
Nice work, Fives.

60
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,550
- Hardcase, right?
- Yeah, that's what they call me.

61
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,380
General Kenobi's battalion, sir?

62
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,180
They're pushing towards the capital.

63
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,140
We'll need to move out
as soon as the men are ready.

64
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,180
All platoons have reported in, General.

65
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,020
- Get some rest.
- Thank you, sir.

66
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I'm fine.

67
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,110
The General's giving you an order, Dogma.

68
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,690
Of course, sir!

69
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,240
He's wound tight, but he's loyal.

70
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,490
He kind of reminds me of you.

71
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,080
Maybe, back in the day.

72
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,940
- What is that?
- Look out!

73
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,580
Ambush! They're behind us!

74
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,420
The enemy's circled behind us.

75
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,100
Everybody, we must defend our backs!

76
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,850
Call in an air strike on
the enemy positions.

77
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,110
Let's hope they're not too busy
helping Obi-Wan.

78
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,100
There's an opening to our south.

79
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,190
I recommend we move
all platoons off the ridge

80
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,110
in case the air strike overshoots.

81
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,950
Good thinking, Rex.

82
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,740
Everyone, move out, now!

83
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,310
All here, sir.

84
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,910
Stay covered. We have to hold the position.

85
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,650
Are you sure those bombers are coming?

86
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,450
Good old Odd Ball.

87
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,540
Always on target.

88
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,340
- Glad we got off that ridge.
- Yeah.

89
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,050
That'll teach them.

90
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,400
General Krell's here?

91
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,320
Something big must be going on.

92
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,120
Master Krell,
my thanks for the air support.

93
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,830
Indeed, General Skywalker.

94
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,460
The locals have proven to be
more resourceful than we anticipated.

95
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,880
But that's not the reason for your visit?

96
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,130
No.

97
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,960
The Council has ordered you
back to Coruscant, effective immediately.

98
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,380
What? Why?

99
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,850
I'm afraid a request was made
by the Supreme Chancellor,

100
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,430
and the Council obliged.

101
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,760
That is all they would tell me.

102
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Well, I can't just leave my men.

103
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,650
I'll be taking over in the interim.

104
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,980
Don't worry about a thing, sir.

105
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:37,230
We'll have this city under Republic control
by the time you're back.

106
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,400
Master Krell, this is Rex,
my first in command.

107
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,240
You won't find a finer
and more loyal trooper anywhere.

108
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,920
Good to hear that.

109
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:48,160
I wish you well, Skywalker.

110
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,430
Your reputation precedes you, General.
It is an honor to be serving you.

111
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,100
I find it very interesting, Captain,

112
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,740
that you are able to recognize
the value of honor,

113
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,060
for a clone.

114
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,280
Stand at attention when I address you.

115
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,070
Your flattery is duly noted,
but it will not be rewarded.

116
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,080
There's a reason
my command is so effective,

117
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,870
and it's because I do things by the book,
and that includes protocol.

118
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,000
Have all platoons ready
to move out immediately.

119
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,250
That is all.

120
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,560
Quicken that pace, battalion.

121
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,310
This isn't some training course on Kamino.

122
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,480
The new general has a way with words.

123
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,520
He's just trying to keep us on schedule.

124
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,270
By raising everyone's ire?

125
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,570
Either way, he's in charge,
and we've got a job to do.

126
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,070
Just treat him with respect,
and we'll all get along fine.

127
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,910
Do you see that?

128
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,490
Yeah. Ready your weapons.

129
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,410
Anyone else wanna
stop and play with the animals?

130
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,050
Didn't think so.

131
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,250
Now keep moving!

132
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,100
Sir, we've been keeping this pace
for 12 hours now.

133
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,970
The men are getting worn down.

134
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,810
We should rest.

135
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,950
General Krell, the top of this ridge
will make a good place

136
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,270
for the men to make camp.

137
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,030
The men don't need rest.

138
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,070
They need the resolve
to complete the task at hand.

139
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,500
- But, sir...
- CT-7567, are you reading me?

140
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,580
Excuse me, sir?

141
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,470
I asked you a question, CT-7567.

142
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,670
Do you understand the need
to adhere to my strategy?

143
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,920
Sir, the terrain is extremely hostile.

144
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,180
Despite the difficulty of the conditions,
the battalion is making good time.

145
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,140
- These men just need a little break.
- Captain,

146
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,260
do I need to remind you

147
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:56,060
of this battalion's strategic mission
in conquering this planet?

148
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
Look back.

149
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,610
See those platoons?

150
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,980
Their mission is to take this city
and take it swiftly.

151
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,620
Time and rest are luxuries
the Republic cannot afford.

152
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,940
We are the key to this invasion.

153
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,660
The other battalions
are counting on our support.

154
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,950
If we fail, everyone fails!
Do you understand this?

155
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,620
Do all of you understand this?

156
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,660
Now, move on!

157
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,760
Sir, we're ready
to bring our forward platoons in

158
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,770
for a surgical strike
on the city's defenses.

159
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,860
- There won't be any need, Captain.
- Sir?

160
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,860
All platoons will execute a forward assault
along the main route to the city.

161
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,990
But, sir, General Skywalker's plan was
to surprise them with multiple attacks.

162
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,660
If we come in from the main route,

163
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,280
they're likely to engage us
in a full frontal assault.

164
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,910
Change of plans, Captain.
I'm in command now.

165
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,170
With all due respect, General,
we don't know what we are up against.

166
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,170
It might be wiser to think first.

167
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:07,210
Are you questioning my order?

168
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:11,840
This battalion will take the main road
straight to the capital.

169
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,930
You will not stop,

170
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,010
and you will not turn back,
regardless of the resistance you meet.

171
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,850
We will attack them with all our troops,
not some sneak attack with a few men.

172
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,690
That is my order.
And you will follow it explicitly.

173
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,870
Do I make myself clear, CT-7567?

174
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,950
Yes, General.

175
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,950
Now, engage!

176
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,730
So, why aren't we sticking
to the original plan,

177
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,050
and probing the city defenses first?

178
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,720
We can do this. Let's take them.

179
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,560
Yeah, leave it to Hardcase
to dive in head first.

180
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,900
The General's new plan is reckless.

181
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,770
You ever think that maybe
the General knows what he is doing?

182
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,990
I know you think this is a bad idea.

183
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,990
I raised my objection
to General Krell's plan,

184
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,490
but he didn't agree.

185
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,210
So, this is it.

186
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
What if he's wrong? Then what?

187
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,120
This isn't the time for a debate.
Right now, we have to stay alert.

188
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,760
Eh, it's too quiet out there.

189
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,190
Mines! Nobody move!

190
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Oz is down.

191
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,500
So is Ringo.

192
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,290
Can you sweep them?

193
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,180
There are more over here.

194
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,810
Looks like the whole road's
been booby trapped.

195
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,590
Everyone, watch your step.

196
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,480
We're completely exposed.

197
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
Hold your ground!

198
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,150
You want a piece of this?

199
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,450
Uh-oh. I think Hardcase made them mad.

200
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,960
We're blown!

201
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,080
The Umbarans are advancing.

202
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,960
Make them eat heat.

203
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:17,086
They're coming from all directions!

204
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,440
We don't have any cover!

205
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,990
We need to pull back.

206
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:23,200
Get them to follow us.
If we can draw them out, we can see them.

207
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,870
If we can see them, we can hit them.

208
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:29,210
All squads, pull back now!

209
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:31,840
This can't be good.

210
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,560
Feeble minded clones!

211
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,430
Get in there and save their necks.

212
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,690
Get ready. Here they come!

213
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,790
Stand back.
Hit them with everything you got.

214
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,090
Where are you going?

215
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,880
Get back here!

216
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,800
They're pulling back.

217
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,060
CT-7567.

218
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,270
Do you have a malfunction in your design?

219
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,950
You've pulled your forces back
from taking the capital city.

220
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,530
The enemy now has control of this route.

221
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,360
This entire operation
has been compromised,

222
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,110
because of your failure.

223
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,240
General Krell, in case you haven't noticed,
Captain Rex just saved this platoon.

224
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,080
Surely you won't fail to recognize that.

225
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,330
ARC-5555,

226
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,580
stand down.

227
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,800
Sir. Yes, sir.

228
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,220
Sir, if I may address your accusation,
I followed your orders.

229
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,560
Even in the face of a plan,
that was, in my opinion, severely flawed.

230
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,220
A plan that cost us men.

231
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,180
Not clones! Men!

232
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:19,190
As sure as it is my duty
to remain loyal to your command,

233
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,320
I also have another duty.
To protect those men.

234
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,490
You have a spark of tenacity, Captain.
I'll give you that.

235
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,330
I know that I don't command
like the Jedi you're used to serving,

236
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,080
certainly not like General Skywalker,
but I have my way.

237
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,670
It may be difficult,
but these are difficult times.

238
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,050
And it's proven effective.

239
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:48,510
And I suppose your loyalty to your men
is to be commended.

240
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,890
They seem to admire this.

241
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:53,350
That's important
to an effective commander.

242
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,900
All right, Captain Rex,
your opinion has been noted.

243
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,270
Dismissed.

244
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,410
I think he almost complimented you.

245
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
It's hard to tell.

246
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,960
Incoming!

247
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,880
Get back! Get back!

248
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,460
The Umbarans must have regrouped
for a counterattack.

249
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,960
Everyone, we must hold this position!

250
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,486
You think General Krell
still intends on taking the capital

251
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,920
using this strategy?

252
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,430
I don't know. I'll get back to you on that
if we survive this battle.
