1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,500
<i>A planet under siege!</i>

2
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,980
<i>Separatist forces mercilessly batter</i>

3
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,220
<i>the beautiful and elegant world
of Christophsis.</i>

4
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,180
<i>Unable to defend themselves
any longer,</i>

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,540
<i>the people of Christophsis
call on the Jedi for assistance.</i>

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,140
<i>Hoping to save lives
and prevent further destruction,</i>

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,340
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker
plan a daring ambush</i>

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,220
<i>which could turn the tide in the fight
for this crucial star system.</i>

9
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,179
Anakin,

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,300
- <i>how are you doing over there?</i>
- We're set.

11
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,660
I've got some guys here
that are anxious to get going.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,820
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

13
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,700
We're back, General.

14
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,220
Good.
The show is about to begin.

15
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,420
How's that cannon coming, boys?

16
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,140
We'll have this one back in business
in no time, sir.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,340
The droids are advancing.

18
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,900
I'm seeing a full battalion
coming right on schedule.

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,940
Tanks!
They brought tanks.

20
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,420
A little closer.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,620
They're splitting up.

22
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,820
What?

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,180
Something's gone wrong.
Prepare all troops for...

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,820
Abort the mission!

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,300
Our position's been compromised.

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,220
Obi-Wan, what's going on?

27
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,460
We're cut off.
The droids are on to us.

28
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,620
Gunship, come in. Hawk,
we need an evac in the south tower.

29
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,980
Roger that, sir. We're coming.

30
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,980
- South tower? We're in the north.
- Not for long.

31
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,700
Rex, fire your cables.

32
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:41,340
Blast them!

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,660
- This way is clear.
- How did you get over here?

34
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,020
I improvised.

35
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,060
Now what?

36
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
Maybe this tactical droid will tell us
how they knew our plan.

37
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,340
<i>The Republic army
is in the north and south towers,</i>

38
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,780
<i>level 46.</i>

39
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,020
It just doesn't make sense.

40
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,500
Blast!

41
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,540
Well, at least we're not the only ones
having a bad day.

42
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,620
Generals.

43
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,180
They had all our intel.

44
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,140
That would explain the ambush.

45
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,220
How could we have left ourselves
so vulnerable to a security breach?

46
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,740
- I don't think we did.
- You think someone...

47
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,260
- infiltrated our defenses?
- Possibly.

48
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,140
It'd have to be someone
cunning and resourceful enough

49
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,060
to gain access to all our plans.

50
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,580
But that still wouldn't explain
how they got our intel.

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,540
No, you're right.

52
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,140
They wouldn't act alone. They'd have
someone working with them.

53
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,460
A spy, sir?

54
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,180
But who would want to
betray our troops to the Seppies?

55
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,980
Excellent question, Commander.

56
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,620
Perhaps it's time we made a visit
behind enemy lines.

57
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,460
- I think we'll find our answers there.
- We'll get right on it.

58
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,420
No, Captain. I need you here
to find the security breach.

59
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,500
- You can count on us, sir.
- One more thing.

60
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,900
This mission
is extremely confidential.

61
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,620
The spy could be anyone.

62
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,620
Let no one know of our mission.

63
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,820
Understood, sir.

64
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,580
Someone left his com-link on.

65
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,620
Someone has been listening
to everything we said.

66
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Hey! Stop!

67
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,380
Who's that?

68
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,540
I'll follow him.
You take the west corridor.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,620
I'm on it.

70
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,260
He must have gone in the mess hall.

71
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,460
We've got a big problem.

72
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,860
Yeah.

73
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,820
The only people in here
are brothers.

74
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,360
One of us?

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,480
Great, but which one?

76
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,920
We'll have to wait for his next move.
Keep this to ourselves.

77
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,640
Better contact the Jedi.

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm on it.

79
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
Don't shoot. Just keep
their communications jammed.

80
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,040
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

81
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,560
We can't reach General Kenobi.

82
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,400
Whoever it is
has blocked our communications.

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,120
We're gonna have to
find this guy ourselves.

84
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,600
R2, come over here and plug in.

85
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,600
What are you doing?

86
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,160
The guard got his messages
out there somehow.

87
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
- We just got to find 'em.
- What do you think?

88
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,680
- He just sat down and wrote a note?
- You have to start somewhere.

89
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,960
We appear to have picked up
some friends.

90
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,000
Indeed.

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,640
In fact, I believe the number of eyes
watching us has been steadily growing.

92
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,440
Great. Perhaps this means our adversary
has learned about our mission.

93
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Perhaps it does.

94
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
Of course,
nobody's tried to stop us yet.

95
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,600
Also true.

96
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,920
They want us to get to
the Separatist headquarters,

97
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,640
which means this is a trap.

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,920
I imagine it is.

99
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,400
Well, that's unfortunate.
For them.

100
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,680
R2's found something.

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,240
What is it? Is it the traitor?

102
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm not sure.

103
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,720
- Maybe.
- What is he looking for?

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,560
Wavelength interference,
weak frequencies, spotty, irregular.

105
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,880
See how it shows up
every few days...

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,640
then disappears?
Day to day, you wouldn't notice it.

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
- What?
- It's the pattern.

108
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,840
The band's only coming
off one terminal in the whole base.

109
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
Check it out.

110
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,480
Slick's barracks.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,080
Only Slick's men
would have access to that terminal.

112
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,280
Slick's not gonna like that.

113
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,680
No, he's not.

114
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,600
But if one of his men
is giving away our intel,

115
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,720
we have to find him
and sort this out.

116
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,480
No guards, no barricades.

117
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,360
You'd think the Separatist headquarters
would be better protected.

118
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,600
But clearly, keeping us out
is not what they intend.

119
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
No way. My guys are the best.

120
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,680
No way they're capable
of something like this.

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,280
Something like what?

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
- You called them here?
- Of course we did.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,440
We're getting to
the bottom of this now.

124
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,560
Look, let me have a few minutes
with them first.

125
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
It's gonna hit them hard.

126
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,800
They trust each other,
and if one of our own betrayed us...

127
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,240
I don't think that's necessary.
Your men are tough, right?

128
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
Take a seat, gentlemen.

129
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,360
We have a turncoat in our midst,

130
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,240
and we think it's one of you.

131
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,320
So this is the belly of the beast.

132
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,760
Ventress.

133
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,720
And here I thought this mission
would be unpleasant.

134
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:50,000
The pleasure's all mine,
my dear Obi-Wan.

135
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,200
I've missed you.

136
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
I don't know, I was doing the things
I always do after a mission.

137
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,640
- Things like what?
- I'm sorry, sir.

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm just a little nervous.
You're my C.O.

139
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,600
The way I figure it,

140
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,840
you tell the truth,
you got nothing to be nervous about.

141
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,000
Jester is telling the truth. He cleans
his weapon after every mission.

142
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,120
First thing, every time.
He's kind of obsessed that way.

143
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,200
Is that right?

144
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,240
- You were cleaning your weapon?
- Yes, sir.

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,080
Go on the computer
while you were in here?

146
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,200
No, sir. I didn't even power it up.
You can check.

147
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
Show me your weapon.

148
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
Yep, freshly scrubbed.

149
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,680
- The rag's over there in the corner.
- Good man.

150
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
You.

151
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,040
- You were cleaning your weapon too?
- No, I was hungry.

152
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
I went back to the mess.

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,960
- Right away?
- Yeah.

154
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,360
Anyone with you?

155
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,520
Sketch, sir.

156
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,880
We got to the mess at the same time,
got our grub, and sat together.

157
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,360
Anyone else in the mess able to confirm
what you two are saying?

158
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,520
Lots of guys there.
Ask any of them.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,800
- We will.
- Captain, give me a moment with them.

160
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
No, it's okay, Sarge.
I got nothing to hide.

161
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,400
I was in the infirmary.

162
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,360
Got banged up pretty good
by one of those clankers.

163
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,160
A med droid was fixing me up.

164
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,320
Doc's got all the records there
if you want to check.

165
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,000
So, Chopper, old boy,

166
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,720
- what's your alibi?
- I was in the mess hall.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,160
No, you weren't!

168
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,800
I mean, you...

169
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,800
If you know something, kid,
you should speak up.

170
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,000
Chopper came in a lot later.

171
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,920
After everyone else.

172
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,640
My loyal informant let me know
you were coming.

173
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,760
Well, then, we thank you
for your hospitality.

174
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,870
Where were you
before you went to the mess, Chopper?

175
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,910
Nowhere.
Walking around.

176
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,870
Son, you know we'll need
a better answer than that.

177
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,670
I was hiding...

178
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,750
at the south exit.

179
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,750
I didn't want anyone to see me
string these together.

180
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,270
Battle droid fingers.

181
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,710
I just...

182
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,990
I just wanted something back.

183
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,190
I guess I felt like they owed me.

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,390
I always knew there was something
deficient about you.

185
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:33,470
This isn't good, Chopper.
Lying about where you were,

186
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,110
taking forbidden items
from a battlefield...

187
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,590
I know.

188
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,670
I put up with the attitude
'cause you have skill.

189
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,150
But if you could break these rules,
your whole character's in question here.

190
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,830
Wait, no! Hang on.

191
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,350
I'm no spy!

192
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,690
Chopper, we're all brothers.

193
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:01,330
But how can we trust anything
you say now?

194
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:04,930
- No, sir, I'm telling you, I did not...
- It's okay.

195
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,210
We'll get you
a proper investigation.

196
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,650
You don't have to say anything
till the Jedi come back and talk to you.

197
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,050
Maybe you should talk, sir.
Tell them where you went.

198
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,370
I was at the south exit, remember?

199
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,490
I saw you go in, sir.
I saw you.

200
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,370
Chopper, I have been patient.

201
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:22,050
Everyone else turned right
toward the barracks and the mess.

202
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,730
You turned left,
toward the command center.

203
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,450
- Where were you going, sir?
- Obviously, the kid feels cornered.

204
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,130
Sergeant, what did you mean,
"till the Jedi come back"?

205
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,850
How did you know the Jedi were gone?

206
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,290
I really wish
you hadn't noticed that, sir.

207
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,570
It's Slick?

208
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,290
Slick's the traitor?

209
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,570
- I've got someone by the gunships.
- That's our Slick.

210
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,170
Now that he's exposed,
he has to get out of this base.

211
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,970
There's no escape now,
you piece of rankweed!

212
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,770
Move. Move!

213
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,930
He took out our weapons depot.

214
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:41,570
He knew where we'd look.

215
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,530
He's not trying to escape.

216
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,490
He knows all our moves
before we even make 'em.

217
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,690
Give up, Ventress!

218
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,730
I am all yours, Obi-Wan.

219
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,650
You've served your purpose.

220
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,010
- We have to get back. Now!
- It's already too late.

221
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:12,690
So hard to know
whom to trust these days, isn't it?

222
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,650
What's the plan, Master?

223
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:17,290
Bringing us here was a mistake,
my sweet.

224
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,170
You've overestimated your abilities.

225
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,490
Really?

226
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,850
Come and get me, boys!

227
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,130
You didn't tell us
you were bringing friends.

228
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,930
Poor Obi-Wan.

229
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,930
You've been betrayed.

230
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,890
And now we're about
to take control of this world.

231
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,770
- How do we get this guy?
- Sir.

232
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,770
Slick ran into the command center.

233
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,530
You guys stay here.
Seal the perimeter.

234
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:16,409
Anakin!

235
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,090
Prepare to march on the city.

236
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,810
Have General Loathesome
delay the Jedi as long as possible.

237
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:40,530
I will need time to execute
the next part of my Master's plan.

238
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,970
Yes, Mistress.

239
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,650
Pretend you're Slick.
What's in your head?

240
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:02,850
My cover's blown, it's time to go,

241
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,170
but I decide not to use a ship
because it's too obvious.

242
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,370
The lockdown.

243
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,570
He wants to get around the lockdown.

244
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,930
He's blinded us
by taking out the power.

245
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,170
He could disable
the entire security system.

246
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,850
But he knows we'd expect him
to do that.

247
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,130
Or does he?

248
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,810
- Yeah, I see what you're getting at.
- Go to the south exit.

249
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,810
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll stay here, get the power back up.

250
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,650
- That'll help.
- Got it.

251
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,650
Hey there, Slick.

252
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,730
Gun's empty.

253
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,490
You know what's funny, traitor?

254
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:56,730
We knew you'd never take a chance
on the exits while they were blocked.

255
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,810
I'd stay here
to open them myself first.

256
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,530
Just like you.

257
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,290
Don't do a job till you've guaranteed
the best odds, right?

258
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,250
You knew I was here.

259
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,930
Of course we knew.

260
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,090
You think we wouldn't have a plan?

261
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,850
I'm not the traitor.

262
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,370
You are!

263
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,090
All of you just blindly
following orders, for what?

264
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,330
At least I got something
out of all this suffering.

265
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:43,450
I bet you sold out your brothers
for some real shiny coin.

266
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,130
Yes, she offered me money.

267
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,570
But she offered me
something more important.

268
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:57,250
Something you wouldn't understand.
Freedom!

269
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,930
I think freedom's
gonna have to wait, kid.

270
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,370
Slick?

271
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,410
- It was you?
- He gave us a bit of a chase, sir.

272
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,770
You couldn't be
a greater disappointment.

273
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,730
How could you do this
to your brothers?

274
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:18,730
Only a Jedi would ask that.

275
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:22,290
It's the Jedi
who keep my brothers enslaved.

276
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,090
We do your bidding.

277
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,770
We serve at your whim.

278
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,130
I just wanted something more.

279
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,930
And all you had to do to get it
was put the rest of us all at risk.

280
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,290
I love my brothers.

281
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,210
You're too blind to see it,

282
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,370
but I was striking the blow
for all clones.

283
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:43,290
If you loved your brothers,
you wouldn't have put them at risk.

284
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:45,570
You betrayed everyone of us.

285
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,090
Take him to lockup.

286
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,570
Were you able to salvage anything
from the weapons depot?

287
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:57,570
Slick pretty much scorched
the whole thing.

288
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:59,850
That seemed to be
what he was going for all along.

289
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:02,010
We managed to save
the heavy cannons, though.

290
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,090
That's good,

291
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:06,010
'cause there are about
1,000 battle droids on their way here.

292
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,170
The fight goes on, gentlemen.
