1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,210
Clone crisis!

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,090
After the mysterious death
of his friend Tup,

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,830
ARC Trooper Fives
embarked on an investigation,

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,130
which led to the discovery
of a hidden chip

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,460
which is placed inside clone troopers
when they are still embryos.

6
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,920
The Kaminoan scientist Nala Se
claims the chip is harmless

7
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,720
and is meant to restrain the clones
from violent unpredictable action.

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,890
Fives claims otherwise,

9
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,100
and has convinced
Jedi Master Shaak Ti

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,730
to allow him to plead his case

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,520
directly to Supreme Chancellor
Palpatine on Coruscant.

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,780
Attention.

13
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,110
Please be advised
we have arrived at Coruscant

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,280
and will be touching down
at our destination shortly.

15
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,050
No. Wait.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,430
No. What was that?

17
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,810
What did you do?

18
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,450
You drugged me.

19
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,630
Greetings, Master Jedi.
The Chancellor is waiting inside.

20
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,890
Tup... The mission...

21
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,560
AZI-3...

22
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,820
Master Shaak Ti,
it is good to see you again.

23
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,950
I trust you've kept this matter
extremely confidential.

24
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,410
Of course, Chancellor.

25
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,540
Ah, good.

26
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,250
So this is the clone
who has caused so much alarm?

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,090
No... No, you drugged me.

28
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:41,050
She...

29
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,940
There, there, soldier,
don't strain yourself.

30
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
Sir.

31
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,100
Guards, let him down, please.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,150
Now, Trooper,
what brings you before me?

33
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,820
The chips, Chancellor.

34
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
Chips?

35
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,860
These were removed
from both clone troopers.

36
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,030
Clone Trooper Fives claims
they are the cause of the problem.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,370
Those are inhibitor chips,
which are placed in clones

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,790
to make them less aggressive
and more compliant to orders.

39
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,710
I tried to explain to this clone

40
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,210
that they are placed in them
for his own good,

41
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,010
but he removed his chip nonetheless.

42
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,550
Our own good?

43
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,230
This thing they put in us
malfunctioned in Clone Trooper Tup.

44
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,730
I removed his and analyzed it.

45
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,310
There were signs of rapid decay.

46
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,650
And we're positive
this has nothing to do with a virus?

47
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,280
No, we still do not know for sure
what caused Trooper Tup to kill.

48
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,400
We only know that his chip failed.

49
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,700
And now this clone
has removed his own chip,

50
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,240
which makes him
a risk to himself and others.

51
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,250
I'm not at risk.

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,410
Sir, they're covering something up,
I know it.

53
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,580
If it's not them,
then it's a Separatist plot.

54
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:01,090
They use this chip against us
to make us more violent than less.

55
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:03,590
That's why Tup killed General Tiplar.

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,760
A Separatist plot
from before the war even started?

57
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:12,980
That seems unlikely,
don't you agree, Master Shaak Ti?

58
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,770
It does, Chancellor.
It seems very unlikely.

59
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,030
It is absolutely impossible.

60
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,110
What we have here is a single
malfunction to one clone's inhibitor chip

61
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,370
caused by a virus,
Separatist plot or not.

62
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,570
Perhaps it would be best

63
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,950
if Clone Trooper Fives and I
discussed this without your presence.

64
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,290
Chancellor, I must object.

65
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,220
Please, Master Jedi, trust me.

66
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,800
I will not be alone.
I have my security here.

67
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,050
I want this soldier to feel
he is having a fair say in this matter.

68
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,400
Now,

69
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,490
where were we?

70
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,290
- No! Let me go!

71
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,460
- Guards!

72
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,920
No! You!

73
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,050
He tried to kill me. It was so sudden.

74
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,190
You were right, Doctor,

75
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,940
he must have gone mad
without his chip.

76
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,150
You have done all you can, Doctor.

77
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,410
I trust you will keep these safe.

78
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,620
Of course, Chancellor.

79
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,750
Fives, stop!

80
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,510
Fives!

81
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,730
Close the blast doors!

82
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,630
I can't believe Fives would try
to assassinate the Chancellor.

83
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,460
The Kaminoans feel a virus
corrupted the Clone's inhibitor chip,

84
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,800
which has led to this behavior.

85
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:55,360
ARC Trooper Fives feels
he is the victim of a plot,

86
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,600
Separatist or otherwise.

87
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,680
All security and clone forces
on Coruscant

88
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,770
have been ordered to join the manhunt.

89
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,020
The Chancellor has been
moved to his Senate quarters

90
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,940
and the perimeter has been secured.

91
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,280
However, Jedi involvement
has not been requested.

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,740
That's a little odd, isn't it?

93
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,950
Hmm. Discover the truth we must.

94
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,080
If there is a plot involving the clones,
we must get to the bottom of it.

95
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,960
We will investigate quietly, undercover.

96
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,040
We must make sure
this clone is not killed.

97
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,880
I'll handle this investigation.

98
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,380
Fives was part of the 501 st.
If Rex and I find him, he'll trust us.

99
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,680
Be wary.
Since he removed his inhibitor chip,

100
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,390
Fives may no longer be
the man you once knew.

101
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,640
- Here you go.
- Thank you, ladies.

102
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,820
Have a good time on Coruscant, now.

103
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,350
Thank you.

104
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,440
Hey, pal, where to?

105
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,190
Take me to 79's.

106
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,990
The clone bar?

107
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,950
Oh! You're a clone, eh?

108
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,740
Look, just shut up and drive.

109
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,660
Okay, you got it.

110
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,760
So, heading out
for a little fun on the town, eh?

111
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,340
I didn't know clones could have fun.

112
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,680
There's a lot you don't know
about clones.

113
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,320
No one knows.

114
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,570
Ooh, very mysterious, eh?
I like a good mystery.

115
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:11,860
Yeah? You ever hear the one
about the people engineered to kill,

116
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,650
engineered to kill their best friends,

117
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,750
their leaders,
and they don't even know it?

118
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,620
I'm a cab driver, pal.
I hear stories like that all the time.

119
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,060
Hey. You paying for this ride or what?

120
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,180
Ah, bill it to the Republic.

121
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,600
"Bill it to the Republic."
Good one, brother.

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,860
Lousy cheap clones!

123
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,240
It's your credit, pal.
You're paying for this.

124
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,110
Ah, your mother's a droid.

125
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,790
Get out of here.
Droid lover!

126
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,120
Come on, brother, let's go inside.

127
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,920
Corporal, that's a nice hat you got there.

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,500
Mind if I see it?

129
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,880
Oh, sure. Yeah. Sure, you got it.

130
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,050
- To the Republic!

131
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,366
Can I get you fellas anything?

132
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,430
I think it's time for another round.

133
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,180
Hey, bartender!

134
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,600
Hey, see you around, brother.

135
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,580
Kix, Jesse.

136
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,680
To the 212th!

137
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
Down the hatch, boys! Ah!

138
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,940
Fan out and check IDs.

139
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,790
So, I guess the 501 st
is back on Coruscant.

140
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,380
Oh, yeah, we just got back
from Ringo Vinda.

141
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,960
The strangest thing
happened out there.

142
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,090
Yeah, I know.

143
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,470
Fives?

144
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,390
Whoa! What's going on?

145
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,730
They say you tried
to assassinate the Chancellor!

146
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,520
And that you're infected
with that virus that killed Tup.

147
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
I don't have time to explain right now.

148
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,860
All I can tell you
is that I'm being framed.

149
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,820
All of us, even the Jedi,
are in grave danger.

150
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:07,080
But what can I do, Fives?
How can I help?

151
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,620
I need to talk to Rex, or...

152
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,120
Or General Skywalker.

153
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,580
Well, they've been tasked with
finding you. Just turn yourself in!

154
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,210
No! No, I'll never get to them.

155
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,510
You don't understand.

156
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,170
What I'm mixed up in,
it goes all the way to the top.

157
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,590
The highest levels
are involved in the conspiracy.

158
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,600
I have to talk to General Skywalker
and Rex directly, alone.

159
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,140
Look, I can contact Rex, but I can't
guarantee he'll bring the General.

160
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,100
Good, good, good.

161
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,480
Thanks, Kix. I appreciate it.

162
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,860
Here. Here are the coordinates.

163
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,860
Just make sure he meets me there.

164
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,280
Right. Good luck, Fives.

165
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,950
Identification, please.

166
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,370
Have you seen this clone?

167
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,000
- Uh... No, sir. I haven't seen him.
- All right. Move along.

168
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,630
Identification, please.

169
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,480
All right, you guys check out.

170
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,910
Move along.

171
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,150
Sir, the fugitive clone has been spotted
by one of our probes in sector I-9.

172
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:05,790
Well, these are the coordinates
Kix gave us.

173
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,960
Let's hope Fives is inside.

174
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,010
I hope
he knows what he's doing.

175
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,110
Fives?

176
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,570
Fives, we're here.

177
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,900
Come on out,
we just want to talk to you.

178
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,370
General Skywalker, thank you.
Thank you for trusting me.

179
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,380
Have you come without troops?

180
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,500
We have.

181
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,260
Put down your weapons, then.

182
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,130
I don't think so, Fives.

183
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,680
Please, sir.

184
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Please, I'm unarmed.

185
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,310
All right, I'm putting my pistols down.

186
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,770
What are we here for, Fives?

187
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,730
I need your help.

188
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,320
I know you do. We know you're not well.

189
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,530
It's been rough for you
these past couple days.

190
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm not crazy!

191
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,490
Please. Please, just...

192
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,410
Just hear what I have to say.

193
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,840
We're here to help you, Fives.
Just come with us.

194
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,260
Let us take you back to the Temple.

195
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,590
No!

196
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,760
I just need you to listen to me. Please.

197
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,430
I'm not really sure
we have any other choice.

198
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,520
I was framed because I know the truth.

199
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,940
The truth about a plot,
a massive deception!

200
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,110
By whom?

201
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:57,910
Well, there's a sinister plot in the works
against the Jedi.

202
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,120
I have proof of it.

203
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,870
I can prove that everything
that I know is true

204
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,410
beyond a shadow of a doubt!

205
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,410
Show me the evidence.

206
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,330
The evidence is in here.

207
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,960
It's in here. It's in all of us,
every clone!

208
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,720
What is it?

209
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,220
Organic chips,
built into our genetic code

210
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:23,440
to make us do
whatever someone wants,

211
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
even kill the Jedi.

212
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,520
It's all in here!

213
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,940
Let's just get you some help first,
then we can review everything.

214
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,780
It'll be okay, Fives. We'll sort this out.

215
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,450
You don't believe me!

216
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:46,200
We're closing in on the target.
Everyone be ready.

217
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,090
Fives, we are listening to you.
We only want to help.

218
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:56,670
How do I know you're not tricking me?
How do I know it won't be a trap?

219
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,010
The Chancellor will try to kill me!
I promise you that!

220
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,190
The Chancellor?

221
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,230
He's in on it!

222
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,060
I don't know to what extent.
But I know he orchestrated much of this.

223
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,980
He told me in the medical bay!

224
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,330
He told you?
When you tried to assassinate him?

225
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,610
You have gone too far, Fives.

226
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,120
The Chancellor is incapable
of what you claim.

227
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,240
He is!

228
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,740
I swear to you, General.
You have no idea...

229
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,370
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!
Get on your knees!

230
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,040
No! No! No! Stay back!

231
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,000
Don't do it! Don't do it, soldier!

232
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,720
Get away from me!

233
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,260
Fives, no!

234
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,820
Fives!

235
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,390
- Fives!
- Get this ray shield off!

236
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,230
Fives!

237
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,440
Brother!

238
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,730
Call for help! We need a medic!

239
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,490
Rex...

240
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,780
Fives.

241
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,290
This... It's bigger than any of us...

242
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,080
Than anything I could have imagined.

243
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,960
I never meant to...

244
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,260
I only wanted to do my duty.

245
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,760
Brother...

246
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,640
Fives, stay with me, Fives!

247
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,850
Fives!

248
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,430
The mission...

249
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,350
The nightmares...

250
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,270
They're finally over.

251
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,860
Fives?

252
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,410
No, Fives... Come on, Fives.

253
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,450
Don't go! Stay with me. Stay with me.

254
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,370
Fives! Fives!

255
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,830
Don't go.

256
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,870
No!

257
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,830
Oh, no.

258
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,310
A tragic situation, indeed.

259
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,730
About the clone's breakdowns,
have we discovered any new evidence?

260
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:20,940
I've had my own personal doctors
examine both bodies.

261
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:26,160
It appears Nala Se did miss something
in her examination.

262
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,490
Another cause your doctors found?

263
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,870
A parasite, native to Ringo Vinda.

264
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,290
Probably in a canteen of water
they both shared.

265
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:42,300
It did cause the inhibitors to decay,

266
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,800
once the parasite had taken hold.

267
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,090
It is very rare.

268
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,720
However, just to be cautious,

269
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:55,310
we have prepared an inoculation
for every clone trooper in our army.

270
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,350
So, I guess it's over, then?

271
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:04,540
Yes, we can finally put this
whole wretched situation behind us.

272
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,780
We must direct our attention
back to the war at hand.

273
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,040
Each day we grow
closer and closer to victory.

274
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,930
Lord Tyranus, have you received
the inhibitor chip that you requested?

275
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,140
I have indeed.

276
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,220
You have done well, Doctor.

277
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,570
Our plan has gone
undiscovered, Master.

278
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,450
The clone in question is now dead
and the Jedi still suspect nothing.

279
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,420
Good.

280
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,380
Destroy all evidence.

281
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:02,710
When the time comes,
no one will be able to stop our plan

282
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,060
to execute Order 66.
