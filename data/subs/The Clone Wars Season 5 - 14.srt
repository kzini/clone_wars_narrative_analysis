No.

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,440
I want to hear their story.

11
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:29,200
If they're an enemy of the Jedi
then they're a friend of mine.

Do you serve Count Dooku?

I serve no one.

19
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,320
I thought there could only be two Sith,
a master and an apprentice?

20

We are brothers.
The true Lords of the Sith.

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,820

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,830
Destroyed by Jedi.

25
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,660

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,010
Fortune and power.

27
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,760
Repair this one's legs
and do what you can for the other.

28
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,130
Yes, sir.

all Mandalorians once knew.

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,230
Now my people are living in exile
because we will not abandon our heritage.

37
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,520
Our people were warriors. Strong, feared.

38
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,240
Now they're ruled by the new Mandalorians

39
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,410
who think that being a pacifist
is a good thing.

40
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,540
They've given away our honor
and tradition for peace.

41
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,330
Duchess Satine and her corrupt leadership
are crushing our souls,

42
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,660
destroying our identity.

43
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,420
That is our struggle.

44
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,590
If they are weak, why do you wait?

45
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,730
The Duchess has powerful allies,
including your Jedi friend, Kenobi.

46
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,890
He is also responsible for our exile.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,940
Perhaps fortune brought us together.

48
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,400
It is the will of the Force.

49
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,570
We can help you reclaim Mandalore.

50
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,660
And punish Kenobi for his trespasses.

51
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,660
We allied ourselves with Sith before.
Count Dooku, he betrayed us.

52
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,330
Sith are no better than Jedi.

53
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,330
They claim to be powerful,

54
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,000
but we put these two back together
after the Jedi gutted them.

they possess honor.

73
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,540

the true burden of peace.

Your people are strong and skilled,

80
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,100
but you will need an army
to free Mandalore.

81
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,310
There are more on Mandalore
who will join us.

82

83
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,480
We can assemble an army

We are not ready for the Duchess.

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,010
With my plan,
we won't need a bigger force.

There is only one plan, one vision.

111

And it belongs to Death Watch.

113
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,740
Without us, you have no army
and no reason to replace the Duchess.

You shall watch and learn.

182
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,500
The vision has expanded.
You will still rule Mandalore,

183
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,460
and under your protection,
I will command a new galactic underworld.

184
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,350
Mandalore influences a league
of 2,000 neutral systems.

185
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,980
It gives you a great deal of options
for your enterprise.

186
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,140
You have learned
from your previous oversights.

187
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:56,660
With their combined forces, the Republic
and the Separatists will be irrelevant.

188
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,360
Then, are we ready?

189
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:02,740
Mobilize the army.
Send an advance guard to the capital.

190
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,830
I want a list of targets vital
to Mandalore's security.

191
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:11,180
Choose wisely.
There will be no second chances.

192
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,880
Stay focused.
Mandalore will soon be ours,

193
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:30,060
and Maul and his brother will be dead
alongside the Duchess.

194
