1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,442
Diabolical defeat!

2
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,962
Though Republic victories
outnumber their losses,

3
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:26,281
the Jedi have been unable to stop
Separatist advances in the Outer Rim.

4
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:30,920
The ever-elusive General Grievous
stays one step ahead of his opponents.

5
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:33,520
With thousands of droid armies
at his command,

6
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,959
the Jedi can never predict
where Grievous will strike next,

7
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,359
until now.

8
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,639
Stand by! Grievous is boarding.

9
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,637
- Status report.
- There's too many of them!

10
00:00:54,798 --> 00:00:57,837
Get yourselves to the escape pods.
I will deal with Grievous here.

11
00:00:57,998 --> 00:00:59,597
But, sir, they're commando droids!

12
00:00:59,997 --> 00:01:01,956
That does not matter, Captain. Now go!

13
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:25,833
Jedi.

14
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,673
Grievous.

15
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:07,508
Eeth Koth, isn't it?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

16
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:13,947
Your reputation precedes you, General.

17
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,827
The reputation
of a coward and a murderer.

18
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:24,146
Murderer? Is it murder
to rid the galaxy of you Jedi filth?

19
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:14,219
Greetings, Jedi. It would seem once again
one of your order has lost his way,

20
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,259
and, even better,
a leading member of your Jedi Council.

21
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:24,138
Listen to me, Jedi.
I do not care about your politics,

22
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:27,017
I do not care about your Republic,

23
00:03:27,138 --> 00:03:30,537
I only live to see you die!

24
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,776
But death will not come so easily
for Master Koth.

25
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,095
I will make him suffer endlessly,

26
00:03:41,177 --> 00:03:44,455
because I know
that is more painful for you all!

27
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,133
Away with the younglings.
Much there is to discuss.

28
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:00,213
It's time somebody finally put an end
to that monster.

29
00:04:00,854 --> 00:04:05,572
On that, agreed we are.
How to find him, the question remains.

30
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:11,172
After engaging Grievous,
we lost contact with Master Koth.

31
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:12,292
He could be anywhere.

32
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:16,051
Commander Wolffe has found a message
in the holo-transmission.

33
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:17,251
Play back the message.

34
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:23,770
Look, hand signals.

35
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,810
I admit my skills are rusty, but...

36
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,809
"Saleucami system, Sector J-19,

37
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,327
"zero-eight, zero-five, two-nine. "

38
00:04:40,608 --> 00:04:45,047
Saleucami? But intelligence reported
Grievous has no ships near that sector.

39
00:04:45,528 --> 00:04:49,926
Yes, but so often inaccurate
our intelligence is.

40
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:52,806
- I shall go.
- So will I.

41
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:53,886
And I.

44
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:17,883
I shall engage the Separatist fleet

45
00:05:17,924 --> 00:05:20,443
and send you the coordinates
of Grievous' command ship.

46
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:23,962
- Just make sure you get it right.
- I always do.

47
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:26,841
How do you plan on getting Grievous
aboard your ship?

48
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:30,041
Not to worry,
the good general and I have a history.

49
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,641
I'm sure he'll want to even the score
face to face.

50
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:36,280
Meanwhile, we'll jump in undetected
and board the command ship.

51
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:39,680
If Master Koth is still alive,
we will find him.

52
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:41,880
Hopefully, by the end of this mission,

53
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,679
we will have saved Master Koth
and captured General Grievous.

54
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,157
Sir, we have entered
the Saleucami system.

55
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:11,276
- Begin preparations for our landing.
- Yes, my lord.

56
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:15,835
Sir, there are several ships
coming out of hyperspace.

57
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:18,195
Are they Republic or Separatist?

58
00:06:22,075 --> 00:06:25,434
Republic.
Three cruiser class, four escort class.

59
00:06:26,995 --> 00:06:30,793
You see? Your compassionate friends
have come to rescue you.

60
00:06:31,754 --> 00:06:33,433
Just as I knew they would.

61
00:06:50,312 --> 00:06:53,591
One of the Republic ships
is hailing us, my lord.

62
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,350
Put him through.

63
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:01,229
General.
I knew one day I'd catch up to you.

64
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:07,389
Kenobi! What a surprise. I assume
you are here to bring me to justice?

65
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,749
- You know me too well.
- Indeed I do!

66
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,467
Prepare to fire all cannons, and be alert.
Where there is Kenobi,

67
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:18,747
you will always find Skywalker
not far behind.

68
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:25,386
The enemy ships are faster and
more maneuverable. I suggest caution.

69
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:30,665
Draw them in. I want to board that vessel.
I shall kill Kenobi face to face.

70
00:07:36,145 --> 00:07:38,624
Well, we certainly have his attention.

71
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:42,824
Admiral Yularen, keep Grievous' fleet
occupied so Anakin's arrival is undetected.

72
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:49,463
Yes, General.
Commence attack! All ships fire at will!

73
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:53,223
Yes, sir! We're moving in.

74
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:04,341
Commander Cody, do you have the exact
coordinates of the command ship yet?

75
00:08:04,422 --> 00:08:05,861
We are patching them through now, sir.

76
00:08:08,342 --> 00:08:10,500
We are receiving the coordinates
from General Kenobi.

77
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,860
How close are you going to jump in
next to Grievous' ship?

78
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:16,940
Pretty close. Buckle up, boys.

79
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,819
- Define "pretty close. "
- Close enough to get the job done.

80
00:08:28,739 --> 00:08:32,497
Get me a tractor beam lock on Kenobi's
ship and prepare a boarding party!

81
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,977
Tractor beam has us, sir.
Shall we fire on the source?

82
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:44,496
No, Cody. Let them think they have us.
We need the diversion for Anakin.

83
00:08:47,336 --> 00:08:49,895
We're coming out of hyperspace. Hang on!

84
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:05,533
Primary power down.

85
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:16,251
So, was that close enough for you?

86
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,971
Any closer
and we'd be flying down hallways.

87
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,171
Ah, next time.

88
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,450
- Coast is clear, Rex.
- Copy that, sir.

89
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,288
Stay here and guard the entrance.
This may be our only way out.

90
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,968
Skywalker, Master Koth is located
on the bridge. This way.

91
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:57,566
Remember, we need to keep Grievous on
this ship until General Skywalker is clear.

92
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:12,044
Look out!

93
00:10:28,643 --> 00:10:29,682
Kenobi.

94
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,442
- How are we doing?
- We are close.

95
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,759
So, Kenobi, is everything
going as planned?

96
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,799
That depends
on your point of view, General.

97
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,997
You wouldn't come here without a plan.
And you wouldn't come alone.

98
00:11:06,158 --> 00:11:09,797
Tell me, do you think Skywalker
has rescued Master Koth yet?

99
00:11:21,196 --> 00:11:24,235
- Surprise.
- Not exactly.

100
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,074
Well, at least they're not destroyer droids.

101
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:42,312
The General's description of your tactics
have been 100% accurate today.

102
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:45,672
Very impressive, even by my standards.

103
00:11:57,992 --> 00:12:01,950
Your plans
have come to ruination, Jedi.

104
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:04,710
I hear a lot of talking, General.

105
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,869
But in the final accounting,
what does all the talk get you?

106
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,309
A futile quest for power, a mutilated body

107
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:14,069
and your place as Dooku's errand boy.

108
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:19,427
I'm no errand boy.
I am not in this war for Dooku's politics.

109
00:12:19,549 --> 00:12:24,147
I am the leader of the most powerful
droid army the galaxy has ever seen.

110
00:12:27,908 --> 00:12:32,466
An army with no loyalty, no spirit.
Just programming.

111
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:35,826
What have you to show for all your power?
What have you to gain?

112
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:40,225
The future.
A future where there are no Jedi.

113
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:53,183
The story of Obi-Wan Kenobi ends here.

114
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:10,301
One more step and your friend will die.

115
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,900
Ha, ha, ha.

116
00:13:29,819 --> 00:13:30,938
No!

117
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:50,256
Your friends shall die, Kenobi,
and you shall soon follow.

118
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:58,454
Got to get it.

119
00:14:01,815 --> 00:14:02,854
Behind you!

120
00:14:17,614 --> 00:14:18,612
Uh...

121
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:28,091
I see you got my message.
Where's Grievous?

122
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:32,170
If everything's gone according to plan,
he's onboard Obi-Wan's ship.

123
00:14:32,531 --> 00:14:33,530
He's been captured?

124
00:14:33,651 --> 00:14:36,450
If we can cut off his escape,
there's a good chance of that.

125
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:53,808
- Surrender, General.
- Never!

126
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,086
Anakin! I hope
you've rescued Master Koth,

127
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,686
because Grievous is headed
back to his ship.

128
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:09,566
You both go.
I'll make it back. I'll be fine.

129
00:15:09,806 --> 00:15:11,765
I'll have to disagree with you on that one.

130
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:15,364
Master Gallia, you go ahead.
I'll get Eeth back to the shuttle.

131
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,205
May the Force be with you.

132
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:24,644
Get back to the bridge. We need to detach
before Grievous jumps ship.

133
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,763
Cody, come in!
- Yes, sir.

134
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,643
Grievous is headed your way.

135
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:40,321
Open fire on the Republic ship.
Target their engines!

136
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,881
But, sir, the ships are still attached.

137
00:15:42,962 --> 00:15:46,601
It doesn't matter. Prepare all troops
for our landing on Saleucami.

138
00:16:03,439 --> 00:16:07,118
The circuits are fried. We have no controls.
I can't even get the engines online.

139
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,433
- We've lost our stabilizers!
- I can't hold her steady!

140
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:10,429
Until we meet again, Kenobi!

141
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,624
Hurry! We can still catch him!

142
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:55,024
Obi-Wan, Anakin's leaving.
We'll be trapped on the ship.

143
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,344
Anakin, come in.

144
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:05,702
We're in a bit of a spot
and we need a way off of Grievous' ship.

145
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:09,702
There's a large hangar near your position.
Make your way there and I'll pick you up.

146
00:18:12,302 --> 00:18:14,341
All droids to the landing craft.

147
00:18:14,423 --> 00:18:16,541
All droids to the landing craft.

148
00:18:16,622 --> 00:18:18,020
Hey!

149
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,139
Get to your stations,
we're going to detach.

150
00:18:39,779 --> 00:18:41,177
Prepare to launch.

151
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,856
The reactor's been breached.
I can't lock it down!

152
00:19:10,455 --> 00:19:11,454
Here we go!

153
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,492
Anakin, get me Admiral Yularen.

154
00:19:33,812 --> 00:19:37,610
Several craft detached from Grievous' ship
and attempted to land on Saleucami.

155
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,810
Then we'll have to land and follow them.

156
00:19:39,891 --> 00:19:41,610
- Prepare the tanks.
Yes, sir.

157
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:46,009
There must be several landing sites.
It may be hard to locate the good general.

158
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,488
You'll have to command the space battle
while Rex, Cody and I head to the surface.

159
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,329
You sure you can handle this on your own?

160
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,168
I think I can manage.

161
00:20:15,126 --> 00:20:17,605
I'll get Master Koth to a medical frigate.

162
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:22,325
- You all took a great risk rescuing me.
- You're welcome, Master Koth.

163
00:20:22,646 --> 00:20:26,124
Since you divided your forces,
Grievous is still at large.

164
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:28,324
I would have gladly given my life

165
00:20:28,405 --> 00:20:30,923
if it meant bringing that monster
to justice.

166
00:20:31,324 --> 00:20:34,283
Well, at least we all live
to fight another day.
