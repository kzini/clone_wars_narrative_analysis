1
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,400
<i>As the Clone Wars</i>

2
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,330
<i>scorches its destructive path
across the galaxy,</i>

3
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,740
<i>it is the Jedi
who bring order to the chaos.</i>

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,420
<i>Though as the war progresses, the
number of Jedi have declined,</i>

5
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,090
<i>and new younglings are harder to find.</i>

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,336
<i>When a youngling is located, they
are brought to the Jedi Temple</i>

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,870
<i>and learn quickly that their true
family is now the Jedi Order.</i>

8
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,916
<i>The trials are hard.</i>

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,240
<i>Tests must be passed.</i>

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,350
<i>But none is as important
as The Gathering.</i>

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:50,930
<i>It is then that a Jedi's path
will truly begin.</i>

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,970
Hurry, younglings.

13
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,880
You have proved to be
the top of your class.

14
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:04,080
And so now is the time
of The Gathering.

15
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,390
For a Jedi, there is no greater
challenge or honor.

16
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,100
What is The Gathering, Padawan Tano?

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Petro, Ganodi, Byph,
Katooni, Zatt, and Gungi,

18
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,270
the time has come for you
to build your own lightsabers.

19
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,770
I knew it. That's so wizard.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,570
Whoa! I knew it.

21
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,850
This is no simple task,
and many perils lie ahead of you.

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,060
Where we are going, there is no
place more sacred to the Jedi.

23
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,030
Not the most hospitable place.

24
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,500
I think that's the point.

25
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,350
It's a dead end.

26
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,160
Younglings, outstretch your
hands and focus the Force.

27
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,100
Together, and only together,
can we enter.

28
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,080
Now hurry.

29
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,780
The sun has already risen,
and we must begin.

30
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,650
Master Yoda.

31
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,460
The Force made physical, a Jedi is.

32
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,670
Comes great responsibility
with that, yes?

33
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,680
Protect others, how does a Jedi, hmm?

34
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,180
Build your own lightsaber, you shall.

35
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,260
But first, harvest your crystal,
each one of you must.

36
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,830
- See, I told you.
- Yoda, wow.

37
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,440
- No, I told you.
- No, I told you.

38
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,980
The heart of the lightsaber,
the crystal is.

39
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:25,680
Focuses the Force
from the Jedi, it does.

40
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:01,330
If Jedi you are to become, enter
the crystal cave, you must.

41
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,200
Trust yourself, trust each
other, and succeed, you will.

42
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,580
Once you have found your
crystal, do not remain inside.

43
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,820
As daylight ends, the door will freeze
over again, and you will be trapped.

44
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,290
For how long?

45
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,760
For one rotation.

46
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,070
There will be nothing
anyone can do for you.

47
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,510
How will we know
which crystal to pick?

48
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,550
Only you can know which one is yours.

49
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,620
Now, hurry.

50
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,190
How do they expect us
to find our crystals

51
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,830
when the whole place
is made up of ice?

52
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,030
I don't see the big deal, though.

53
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,130
I could easily last a night in here.

54
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,210
From my calculations, taking into
account the planetary movements

55
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,320
in this system, um... the sun
only rises on Ilum every 19 days.

56
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,030
That's a very long night.

57
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,200
Well, I don't know about you
lad, but enough with the chatter.

58
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,010
I'm gonna be the first to get
my crystal and get out of here.

59
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,770
Petro, wait.

60
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,080
Maybe we should stay together.

61
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,490
No, thank you.

62
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,850
You're on your own.

63
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Come on.

64
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,590
We need to keep moving.

65
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,140
You're right. He is selfish.

66
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,520
Ugh! Which way now?

67
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,350
We don't have much time, and we
have no idea where the crystals are.

68
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,590
We need to break into groups.

69
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,860
What? No.

70
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,330
Are we Jedi or cowards?

71
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,440
On the count of three, close
your eyes and point to a door,

72
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,510
and that's the direction
each of us will go.

73
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,420
One, two, three.

74
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,370
Uh, sorry, Byph.

75
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,910
Looks like you're on your own.

76
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,520
Byph, your instincts
told you to go that way.

77
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,490
You have to follow your instincts.

78
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,700
You shouldn't be
afraid of monsters, Byph.

79
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,810
You're a Jedi.

80
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,160
That must be a crystal.

81
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,580
I don't think this is the right way.

82
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,480
We'd better go back.

83
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Wait.

84
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,200
Up there! Look!

85
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,770
Something's flashing.

86
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,770
I can't see anything.

87
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,940
Why can't you see it?

88
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,180
Maybe because it's your crystal.

89
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,020
They said only we would know.

90
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,650
You'll have to climb.

91
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,920
But up there?

92
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,160
It's... it's just so high.

93
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,540
I can't do that.

94
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,300
I believe in you.

95
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,180
What if I get up there
and there's nothing?

96
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,720
Well, that's a risk
you'll have to take.

97
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,250
Hey, you're lucky.

98
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:11,860
I haven't even seen anything
resembling my crystal yet.

99
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,600
Good luck.

100
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,450
A whistling?

101
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,100
I can't hear anything.

102
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,480
You think it's your crystal?

103
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,060
Gungi, no.

104
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,600
You'll never make it.

105
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,000
You'll freeze to death if you fall in.

106
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,140
You need to be patient.

107
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,250
See how the sun is setting
and moving away from the lake?

108
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,720
Just like the door we came
through, it's freezing over again.

109
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,020
Once the water freezes over,
you'll have very little time

110
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,000
to get your crystal and get out.

111
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,780
Now excuse me.

112
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,250
I have a crystal to find.

113
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,186
And I'm running out of time.

114
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,820
Good luck, Gungi.

115
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,006
This whole thing is ridiculous.

116
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,500
I don't even think
there are any crystals.

117
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,770
You hear me?

118
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,410
You just have us walking in
circles until we freeze to death!

119
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm never gonna find a crystal, never!

120
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,390
Whoa!

121
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,780
Now what?

122
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,620
Looks like I'm the first back
with my crystal.

123
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,190
That wasn't so hard.

124
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,830
And the others?

125
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,276
Who knows?

126
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,010
I didn't wanna gloat,
since I found mine so quickly.

127
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,380
Show us.

128
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,440
A crystal you have found.

129
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,100
Water you have brought.

130
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
But that's impossible.

131
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,580
It was my crystal.
I was sure of it.

132
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,980
Mm.

133
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,120
So certain were you.

134
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,070
Go back, and closer you must look.

135
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,040
But the door is already half closed.

136
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,340
Then you better hurry.

137
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,610
Oh!

138
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,520
You can do this, Katooni.

139
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,190
You can do it.

140
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,570
That's impossible.

141
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,980
It's saying there's crystals
everywhere, but I can't see anything.

142
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,150
Where?

143
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,680
Which way?

144
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
Ah!

145
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,460
You're useless!

146
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,460
Stupid, useless, dumb thing.

147
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,010
You can't even find
a simple small crystal.

148
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,590
There's so many.

149
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:27,730
How am I supposed to know
which one is mine?

150
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:32,280
It's hopeless, hopeless.

151
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,170
Well, that's going to take too long.

152
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,630
I... I'm not afraid.

153
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,340
I can do this.

154
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm a Jedi.

155
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,160
I'm one with the Force,
and the Force will guide me.

156
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,630
I'm running out of time.

157
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,540
Where is it?

158
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,820
Come on, Zatt.

159
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:53,750
You're gonna have to trust yourself
instead of relying on technology.

160
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,490
You can do it.

161
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,110
I can feel it.

162
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,740
It's close.

163
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,710
I can sense it.

164
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,480
I can sense it.

165
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,800
That must be it.

166
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,250
Ah!

167
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,120
Oh, great.

168
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,620
Oh, no.

169
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,390
It's a dead end.

170
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,800
Is anyone there?

171
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,270
Can you hear me?

172
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,400
Great.

173
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,710
I have my crystal, but I'll
never get out of this place.

174
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,960
Well done, Gungi.

175
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,100
But two still remain.

176
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,220
Ugh! I'm running in circles.

177
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,120
Petro! Petro!

178
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,977
Katooni?

179
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,830
Petro! I'm trapped.

180
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:49,770
Can you help me get out?

181
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,150
I... I can't.

182
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,250
I still haven't found my crystal.

183
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,350
Petro, you can't leave me.

184
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,030
I... I have to go.

185
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,790
Petro, no!

186
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,870
Petro! Petro!

187
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,040
Will they make it, Master?

188
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,480
We should help them.

189
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,590
Left the cave, you have.

190
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,430
Help them, you will not.

191
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,300
Come on!

192
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,470
Katooni.

193
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,510
Katooni!

194
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,610
Petro?

195
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,656
Petro!

196
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,750
There's no time.

197
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,120
Put your hand on the ice.

198
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,650
Together, we can break it.

199
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,320
I knew you'd come back.

200
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,260
Come on! The doors are closing.

201
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,900
Petro?

202
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,480
Go ahead.

203
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:16,250
I think I see something.

204
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,410
But it's too late.

205
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,450
Trust me.

206
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Go.

207
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,390
I have my crystal,
but Petro is still inside.

208
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:43,910
Give up on your friend, do not.

209
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,060
Petro!

210
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,270
You made it.

211
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,270
How did he break the ice?

212
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,840
Only water made solid was the door.

213
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:07,410
Easy to break if you have the will.

214
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,990
You-you said we would be trapped.

215
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,500
Not by the cave you were,
but by your mind.

216
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,960
Lessons, you have learned.

217
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,610
Find courage, you did.

218
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,150
Hope, patience,

219
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,600
trust, confidence, and selflessness.

220
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,270
Yes?

221
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,950
Take your crystals back to the temple
and keep them safe, young Jedi.

222
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,196
- Yes!
- So exciting.

223
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,130
- Yay!
- All right!
