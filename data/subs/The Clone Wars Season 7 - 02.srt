1
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,339
Conspiracy!

2
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:20,385
After repeated setbacks
on the planet Anaxes,

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,031
an elite clone squad
is deployed to investigate

4
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,259
the Separatists' tactical advantage.

5
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:28,131
This special unit, called the Bad Batch,

6
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,509
infiltrates Admiral Trench's Cyber Center

7
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:32,567
to steal a strategic algorithm

8
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,487
capable of predicting
the Republic's every move.

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,659
What our heroes found

10
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,116
was a live signal
from the ARC trooper known as Echo,

11
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:44,457
a clone long believed to be dead.

12
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:03,481
Word is the general staff
isn't completely behind this mission.

13
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:07,586
I admit the idea that Echo
is still alive is a long shot.

14
00:01:07,696 --> 00:01:09,946
I'm sure the Council
will approve the mission.

15
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:11,871
Just remember the primary goal

16
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,489
is to learn how the Separatists
are predicting our strategy,

17
00:01:14,555 --> 00:01:16,528
whether it's Echo behind it or not.

18
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,365
Well, if you want my opinion,

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,748
sounds like a trap,

20
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:22,335
but me and the boys
will tag along anyway,

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,472
if only to say "I told you so."

22
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:26,501
Just make sure you're ready

23
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,519
if we get the go-ahead
from General Kenobi.

24
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,124
If you're certain
he'll approve the mission, why wait?

25
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,179
Let's get going.

26
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:35,497
First, we have
that thing to do.

27
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:37,030
Uh, what thing?

28
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:38,633
You know.

29
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:40,553
We don't have time for that, sir.

30
00:01:41,785 --> 00:01:43,115
Yes, we do.

31
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,173
Well, I'll just let you two sort this out.

32
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:49,862
I'll be waiting on the ship
with the rest of the team.

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,666
Come on, Rex. I'm late as it is.

34
00:02:24,172 --> 00:02:25,632
You're late again.

35
00:02:28,563 --> 00:02:30,523
Padmé, I'm so sorry.

36
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,765
We didn't anticipate the Outer Rim 
Sieges would last this long.

37
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,750
That would be why
they call it a siege, Anakin.

38
00:02:36,775 --> 00:02:38,625
I know, I just thought that I...

39
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:43,530
You thought you could bring a swift end
to the conflict single-handedly.

40
00:02:44,114 --> 00:02:45,114
Yeah.

41
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,766
Anakin, what you're doing is important.

42
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:52,157
The Republic needs
you on the front lines

43
00:02:52,366 --> 00:02:54,964
just as they need my
voice in the Senate.

44
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,841
I know.

45
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,210
Oh, great.

46
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:16,963
What is it?

47
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,470
Obi-Wan is coming.

48
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:22,722
No, that's not it.

49
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:24,302
There's something else.

50
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,307
It's Rex.

51
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,270
I'm worried he's letting
his personal feelings

52
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,230
drive him too much on this mission.

53
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:34,361
I wonder where he learned that.

54
00:03:38,026 --> 00:03:39,436
Rex, where's Anakin?

55
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:41,277
I need to speak to him 
about this mission.

56
00:03:41,362 --> 00:03:43,452
Well, General, he's, um...

57
00:03:43,531 --> 00:03:45,741
Well, he's inside your barracks, isn't he?

58
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:46,945
Yes, sir.

59
00:03:47,577 --> 00:03:48,947
What's going on here?

60
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,370
Nothing, sir.

61
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:53,115
I was just waiting for the General...
uh, General.

62
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:57,171
You'll have to do
better than that, Captain.

63
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:00,166
You've known Rex a long time.

64
00:04:00,965 --> 00:04:06,255
When you throw caution to the wind
and take chances, where is he?

65
00:04:06,763 --> 00:04:08,103
Right beside me.

66
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:12,388
Then maybe that's where you should be
for him, Ani.

67
00:04:12,894 --> 00:04:16,524
Trust his instincts like he trusts yours.

68
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:19,281
I'm just trying to look out for him.

69
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,400
I know you are.

70
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:25,494
I love you, Ani.

71
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:28,876
I love you too.

72
00:04:31,121 --> 00:04:33,411
Then what is Anakin doing in there?

73
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:37,168
Ah, he's spot-checking my gear, sir.

74
00:04:37,252 --> 00:04:39,382
Really? Without you?

75
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:40,922
Well...

76
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,131
Here you go, Rex.

77
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,876
- And try not to break it again.
- Anakin.

78
00:04:44,968 --> 00:04:47,468
About this mission, the Council thinks...

79
00:04:47,493 --> 00:04:49,373
That it's a good idea? I agree.

80
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:50,814
Let's get moving, Rex.

81
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,020
No, wait. That's not...

82
00:04:52,045 --> 00:04:53,125
No time.

83
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:57,356
I hope you at least told Padmé
I said hello.

84
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:27,184
So, how many missions
has your team been on, Sergeant?

85
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,510
Honestly, sir, I've lost count.

86
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,967
All the action sort of blurs together.

87
00:05:34,058 --> 00:05:38,348
I know you work with Cody sometimes,
but who do you guys report to?

88
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:41,215
Hmm... good question.

89
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,301
Can't say I've got an answer.

90
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:44,865
Yeah!

91
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:49,323
We are approaching Skako Minor.

92
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,468
It looks to be a difficult landing.

93
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,450
Rex, what do we know about this place?

94
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:40,458
On this part of Skako,
there's a race of locals, the Poletecs.

95
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,132
All we know is they're very primitive.

96
00:06:43,211 --> 00:06:44,881
"Primitive" is being kind.

97
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:48,383
My intel says
the Poletecs worship flying reptiles.

98
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,654
Oh! What the heck was that?

99
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:55,097
It's one of those reptiles.

100
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,021
I want that thing off my ship.

101
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,350
Hold on! Hold on!
Don't just run out there.

102
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:13,432
Hey! Get off of there!

103
00:07:13,457 --> 00:07:16,077
Hey, calm down. We 
need to talk to them.

104
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:17,825
Why?

105
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:18,895
The General's right.

106
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:21,495
Watch out, Rex!

107
00:07:34,762 --> 00:07:36,182
I have a thermal reading.

108
00:07:36,264 --> 00:07:38,854
Point-two-five east, elevation 175.

109
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,517
Relax. I'll handle this.

110
00:07:45,774 --> 00:07:47,154
What are you doing?

111
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,863
Going for a ride.

112
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,685
Tech, I'm with the General.

113
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,155
Hone in on my signal.

114
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:16,906
Okay, I think we're gonna have
a slight communication problem here.

115
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:39,353
That creature still has
a hold of the General.

116
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,313
We're going in,
but remember what the General said.

117
00:09:47,395 --> 00:09:50,355
"No casualties, disarm only."

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,860
We're on it, Captain.

119
00:09:51,941 --> 00:09:53,901
Wrecker, Crosshair, rockslide!

120
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:47,659
Tech, translate what he said.

121
00:10:55,797 --> 00:11:00,007
He says
he does not want our war on his planet.

122
00:11:00,552 --> 00:11:02,222
That is why he took our leader.

123
00:11:02,474 --> 00:11:04,143
We didn't bring the war here.

124
00:11:04,222 --> 00:11:06,365
It was Wat Tambor and the Separatists.

125
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,110
Separatists.

126
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:18,279
Tell him we apologize 
for what's happened.

127
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:23,121
But tell him the enemy is holding
one of our men prisoner in Purkoll.

128
00:11:23,146 --> 00:11:27,276
As soon as we rescue him,
we'll leave his planet, for good.

129
00:11:50,562 --> 00:11:53,147
The chief says
he will provide us with scouts

130
00:11:53,229 --> 00:11:55,399
and lead us to Tambor's city.

131
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,032
From there, we're on our own.

132
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,008
Any help is better than no help.

133
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:10,457
We are receiving a transmission
from Admiral Trench on Anaxes.

134
00:12:11,206 --> 00:12:12,286
Put him through.

135
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,206
Pardon the intrusion, Minister Tambor...

136
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,869
but I have disturbing news.

137
00:12:21,359 --> 00:12:23,569
You may proceed, Admiral.

138
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:30,434
An infiltration team of clones
has traced the algorithm signal to Skako.

139
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,517
I believe your operation there
is in jeopardy.

140
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,189
The Republic would not dare attack us.

141
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:43,025
The Techno Union has 
corporate neutrality.

142
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,663
From what I have seen,

143
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,450
that would not matter
to these Republic operatives.

144
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,871
Then we shall be ready for them.

145
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,386
Hope nobody's scared of heights.

146
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,480
Well, I'm not scared of nothing.

147
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,356
I just... When I'm up real high,

148
00:13:18,567 --> 00:13:20,652
I got a problem with gravity.

149
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,307
Speaking of problems,

150
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:24,619
I am no longer picking up Echo's signal.

151
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:26,992
I... I don't understand.

152
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,913
You said it was coming from this city.

153
00:13:28,992 --> 00:13:30,492
I can only speculate,

154
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:34,787
but it is possible there's a latency issue
with the frequency

155
00:13:34,873 --> 00:13:37,833
caused by all these
atmospheric disturbances.

156
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:42,511
Or... maybe they sent the signal
to lure us into a trap.

157
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,879
And maybe your friend's actually dead.

158
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,590
Well, I can't be the only one
thinking of that.

159
00:13:47,677 --> 00:13:49,797
Look, every mission could be a trap.

160
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:51,508
This one is no different.

161
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:56,108
I'm telling you that signal is being sent
by Echo himself! He's alive!

162
00:13:56,311 --> 00:13:59,561
I think you're letting
your personal feelings get in the way

163
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,227
because you left him for dead
at the Citadel.

164
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,572
I had no choice. You hear me?

165
00:14:04,597 --> 00:14:06,147
Oh, I don't blame you.

166
00:14:06,738 --> 00:14:08,778
I would've left him for dead too.

167
00:14:09,157 --> 00:14:12,077
Besides, he's just another reg.

168
00:14:13,495 --> 00:14:14,695
Hey!

169
00:14:15,413 --> 00:14:18,753
Why don't you pick on someone
not your size?

170
00:14:20,502 --> 00:14:22,802
You'll be a whole lot smaller
when I'm through with you.

171
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:24,795
That's enough!

172
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:30,181
Sergeant, take your men
and scout the area for a tower entrance.

173
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,640
I want to talk to my Captain alone.

174
00:14:42,398 --> 00:14:45,398
Rex, I hate to say it, but...

175
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:49,819
you have to prepare yourself
for the possibility that Echo is dead,

176
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:51,986
and this is all a Separatist trick.

177
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:56,365
Sir, I have watched so many of 
my brothers fall during this war,

178
00:14:56,454 --> 00:14:58,924
and I try not to hang on
to any one of them.

179
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:03,038
But that changed when I 
heard that Separatist transmission.

180
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:04,998
It was no algorithm.

181
00:15:05,088 --> 00:15:08,058
That was Echo's voice. I know it.

182
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:09,838
I hope you're right.

183
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,796
But if, for some reason, you're wrong...

184
00:15:12,887 --> 00:15:14,927
Then I'll deal with it.

185
00:15:37,245 --> 00:15:40,415
We're in business, General.
Tech regained Echo's signal.

186
00:15:40,498 --> 00:15:42,057
It's coming from this tower.

187
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,248
How's it going, Tech?

188
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:53,138
Sorry it took so long.

189
00:15:53,636 --> 00:15:55,386
Hey, Crosshair, check it out.

190
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,102
Yeah, it's a lift.

191
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,149
Well, we already knew that.

192
00:16:03,938 --> 00:16:06,108
Wait, wait, wait. A lift?

193
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,186
How far up are we going?

194
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,320
Don't worry, Wrecker. I'll hold your hand.

195
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,235
Hey! Cut it out, Sarge.

196
00:16:14,324 --> 00:16:16,244
Just give me some droids to crush.

197
00:16:22,832 --> 00:16:25,542
Remember, this is a stealth mission.

198
00:16:25,627 --> 00:16:28,417
No blasting, no blowing things up.

199
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:29,795
Nobody knows we're here.

200
00:16:32,884 --> 00:16:34,724
Intruders! Attack!

201
00:16:38,306 --> 00:16:39,846
Why?

202
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,803
So much for stealth.

203
00:17:06,084 --> 00:17:07,634
Yeah! Hah! Ha-ha!

204
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:09,380
Yeah!

205
00:17:10,225 --> 00:17:14,185
Uh... sorry. I just got excited.

206
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:19,072
I've still got a lock on Echo's signal.

207
00:17:19,889 --> 00:17:22,826
All right, men. Let's hunt some droids.

208
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:25,767
Now you're talking! Yeah!

209
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,210
Where exactly
is Echo's signal coming from?

210
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,960
Strange. I just lost the signal.

211
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:49,542
What? How can that be?

212
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:52,758
There's no "atmospheric disturbances"
up here.

213
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,339
Well, I have a new theory.

214
00:17:54,424 --> 00:17:56,934
I'm surprised
I did not consider it earlier.

215
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,510
The signal is only traceable
during data transmissions.

216
00:18:00,597 --> 00:18:03,075
So until Echo
dispenses more intel,

217
00:18:03,168 --> 00:18:04,767
I cannot pick up the signal.

218
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,151
Okay, we're splitting up.

219
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,688
Search every door.

220
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,207
If someone finds Echo,

221
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:11,232
contact the others.

222
00:18:11,316 --> 00:18:14,856
We go in together,
just in case there's trouble.

223
00:18:33,797 --> 00:18:35,417
Drop your weapon!

224
00:18:35,442 --> 00:18:37,232
You are surrounded!

225
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:52,141
Ah! It appears the signal is back.

226
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,533
It's from up ahead.

227
00:18:59,322 --> 00:19:01,122
In there.

228
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:18,037
Tech, open this door.

229
00:19:21,469 --> 00:19:24,469
You clones are so predictable.

230
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:26,643
Wat Tambor.

231
00:19:26,724 --> 00:19:29,887
Your algorithm predicted
nearly every move

232
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:32,654
you made to infiltrate Purkoll.

233
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,480
There is no algorithm.

234
00:19:34,941 --> 00:19:37,111
We know you're holding
a prisoner of war here.

235
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:38,441
Prisoner?

236
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:40,826
I don't know what
you mean, Captain.

237
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:44,141
I am leaving here with my friend.

238
00:19:44,367 --> 00:19:46,617
Your friend is dead.

239
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:48,873
His mind is ours.

240
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:50,539
Liar!

241
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:56,746
Execute them.

242
00:20:47,055 --> 00:20:49,675
Tech, open that door for Rex!

243
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:50,844
Yes, sir!

244
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:53,511
I hope you find
what you're looking for, Captain.

245
00:21:17,293 --> 00:21:19,713
I don't like the look of this.

246
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:28,564
I'm definitely picking up a life-form
in there.

247
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,387
It seems to be a stasis chamber.

248
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,636
I think I can get it open.

249
00:21:48,741 --> 00:21:50,621
Echo. Tech.

250
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:52,582
We got to get him out of here.

251
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:54,333
Figure out how to
unplug him from...

252
00:21:54,795 --> 00:21:56,013
From this mess.

253
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,630
What have they done to you?

254
00:22:04,716 --> 00:22:09,256
We... We have to get to the shuttle
to escape the Citadel.

255
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:11,555
- No! I'll go first.
- Echo.

256
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:14,599
- No! No. No.
- Echo, it's Rex. I'm here.

257
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:15,694
No.

258
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:20,568
Rex? You, you came back for me.

259
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,691
Yes. Yes, I did.

260
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,319
What?

261
00:22:25,724 --> 00:22:27,418
What happened?

262
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:28,894
Where am I?

263
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:30,710
It's okay, Echo.

264
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,544
You're safe now.

265
00:22:32,786 --> 00:22:34,036
Just sit tight, trooper.

266
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,501
You're going home.
