1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,290
Turmoil in the Outer Rim!

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,450
Located near a major hyperspace lane,
the planet Felucia

3
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:26,540
is caught in an unending battle
between Republic and Separatist forces.

4
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:31,140
Clone tank divisions make a valiant push
deep into Separatist controlled territory

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,980
led by Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano.

6
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,470
General Grievous
learning of the impending Jedi attack,

7
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,810
has dispatched reinforcements
to one of his droid outposts

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,640
hoping to secure his grip on the system.

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,550
Droid re-enforcements
have just arrived.

10
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,170
We shall break into three groups
to divide their defenses.

11
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,890
I'll take the left flank.
Skywalker, attack the front gate,

12
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,640
Ahsoka, you scale the back wall,
we'll meet in the middle.

13
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,890
Okay, scouts, find me a way down there,
quiet-like.

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
Going through the front gate won't be easy.

15
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,520
You have it tougher going over that wall.

16
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,480
You taught me well. I can handle anything.

17
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,820
Don't get cocky.

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,220
- Hold up, I sense something out there.
- A droid?

19
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,840
I don't think so.

20
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,720
Probably just an animal.

21
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:12,400
- Come on, we got to get to that wall.
- Stay alert, men. Let's move.

22
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,750
Skywalker, Ahsoka, are you in position?

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,540
Ready and waiting, Master Plo.

24
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,640
We're in position.

25
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:48,720
We are detecting several Republic tanks
moving in on the ridge in front of us.

26
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,770
Artillery, open fire.

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,950
Form up for counter attack. Lower the gate.

28
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,780
Forward, forward, attack!

29
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,130
- Steady, steady, wait for my move.
- Copy that.

30
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,720
Follow me.

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,590
Comet, Sinker, Boost, get up there.

32
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,170
- We're all clear, Commander, come on up.
- I'll be right there.

33
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,360
I can't believe my luck, a Jedi youngling.

34
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,540
The outpost is secure.

35
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:41,750
Good job, Corporal.
Where's Commander Tano?

36
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,380
She was covering our flank
when we scaled the wall.

37
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,890
Everybody fan out.
I want a perimeter sweep now.

38
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,140
Ahsoka, state your location.

39
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,820
Ahsoka, come in. Are you there?
Can you hear me?

40
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,980
Ahsoka, come in. Where could she be?

41
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,280
Ahsoka, can you hear me? Ahsoka!

42
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,500
You won't be needing this.

43
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,670
Hey, what is this place?
Who are these pirates?

44
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,420
These are Trandoshans,

45
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,840
they're gonna release us
and hunt us down for sport.

46
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,930
Hunt us down?

47
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:34,470
We have found new prey for the hunt.

48
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,690
The youngling will provide great sport.

49
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,520
Perhaps your first Jedi kill.

50
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,660
Are you ready, Young Dar?

51
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,610
She'll die by my claw.

52
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,000
Your son will outplay all comers.

53
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,560
We'll take this new batch to Island Four.

54
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,550
Time to see
who's smart enough to join the hunt.

55
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,590
Open fire!

56
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,290
You need to come with us.

57
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,880
Who are you?

58
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,010
We used to be Jedi younglings.

59
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,370
We never stood a chance.
They attacked us on a training mission.

60
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,870
We were captured and brought here.

61
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Why would they take younglings?

62
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,250
Because Jedi Knights
are too powerful for them.

63
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,090
I'm Kalifa. This is O-Mer and Jinx.

64
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,440
- Who are you?
- Ahsoka Tano.

65
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,550
I was captured during the Battle
of Felucia. I'm a Padawan learner.

66
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,770
- What's the situation here?
- You'd better sit down.

67
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,600
We were taken by those foul lizards
for their amusement.

68
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,440
To be hunted, killed
and mounted on their wall as trophies.

69
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,200
We've been stuck here for more rotations
than we can count.

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,450
No one has come for us.
I doubt anyone is still looking.

71
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,080
Chew on that, Padawan, then rest.
You'll need your strength.

72
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,130
General, we've been over the same area
a dozen times,

73
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,090
there's no sign of Commander Tano.

74
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,630
Not good enough, Rex, try again.

75
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,060
We have alerted our forces
throughout the Outer Rim

76
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,230
and intelligence assets
inside the Confederacy.

77
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,150
- If she's spotted, we shall know about it.
- Good.

78
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,990
Skywalker, our mission here is finished.
We must return to Coruscant.

79
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,450
I am not abandoning her.

80
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:21,530
Your emotions are clouding your judgment.

81
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,580
- I will not leave her fate up to others.
- It's time to go.

82
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,840
Call everybody in, Rex, we're leaving.

83
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,220
Ahsoka, it's time to go.

84
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,640
What's happened?

85
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,740
The sun's almost up
which means we clear out.

86
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,150
- Where do you go?
- We keep moving

87
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,610
and keep those disgusting hunters
from picking up our scent.

88
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,820
That's your plan?

89
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:04,410
If you really are a Padawan, you would
know there's wisdom in experience.

90
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,330
We've been here longer.
You will learn if you listen.

91
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,750
And only if you listen.

92
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,230
The sun has risen, let the hunt begin!

93
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,520
Get down. Someone's coming.

94
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,240
Those two came in with me,
we should help them.

95
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,450
No, it's too late.

96
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,880
Look at her run.

97
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,510
It's your shot, take her out.

98
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Ugh!

99
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,240
We could've stopped them.

100
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,370
No, Ahsoka, we are not saviors here.
Here, we are survivors.

101
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,210
If they had spotted us we'd be dead now.

102
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,840
We'll never get out of here
if we just keep hiding.

103
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,920
We have to act.

104
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,680
There were other Padawans here
that once thought as you do now.

105
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,850
- All right, where are they?
- They're dead!

106
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,270
Just because they failed
doesn't mean we will.

107
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,810
You don't understand,

108
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,780
it's not that we don't want to fight,
we're younglings.

109
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,530
They have every advantage.

110
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,740
- Get back here.
- I can't do that.

111
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,870
My Master would never forgive me

112
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,620
for running and hiding
in a situation like this.

113
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,540
Do not overestimate your abilities.

114
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,050
I'm not.

115
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,590
Ahsoka, don't...

116
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,940
Here, lizard, lizard. Come and find me.

117
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,140
Kalifa! Don't kill him out of hatred.
It's not the Jedi way.

118
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,290
The others will be coming.

119
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,070
I don't understand,
why won't this thing work?

120
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:42,700
The Trandoshans deactivate the blasters
if we take them.

121
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:45,150
That is why none of us have any.

122
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,620
It's been a long time since the Trandoshans

123
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,410
captured another Padawan
and brought them here.

124
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,200
- Thanks.
- I didn't mean it as an insult.

125
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,210
I meant it as a sign,
a mistake on their part.

126
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,710
Ahsoka, your energy, your strength,
it's what we've been lacking.

127
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,880
We were beginning to lose hope
and forgot who we are.

128
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,260
And who are you?

129
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,140
We are Jedi.

130
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:23,100
All right, we need a strategy.

131
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:27,320
- So, what do you suggest?
- What about a base?

132
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I mean, they must have a compound
or something, right?

133
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,370
Not that we've ever seen.

134
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,320
So where do they come from?

135
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,950
We don't know, we've only witnessed them
hunting and in their hover pods.

136
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,540
If we are gonna go on the offensive,
we'll need to find out where they live.

137
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,460
We'll start covering ground tomorrow.

138
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar!

139
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,970
Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar! Dar!

140
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,260
We have already covered the beach area

141
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,270
and most of the briar
on this side of the bay.

142
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:43,020
If it was easy to find, you guys
would have found it before I got here.

143
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,400
True enough.

144
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,560
- Maybe we should try more inland?
- It's worth a shot.

145
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,570
Guys, I think
we're looking in the wrong place.

146
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:56,030
That's their fortress.

147
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,740
Split up!

148
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,650
O-Mer, this way!

149
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:50,830
Kalifa!

150
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,720
- Finish her, my son, the kill is yours.
- I will kill her with my own hands.

151
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,660
Come here, you Jedi whelp.

152
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,840
Not so impressive, are you?

153
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,340
And yet you have the honor of being
my first Jedi kill.

154
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,900
First of many, I hope.

155
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,830
- Careful.
- It's okay. I can make it.

156
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,620
Kalifa!

157
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,410
Those Jedi whelps killed my son.

158
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:54,080
Young Dar!

159
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,760
There's no escape! I'll hunt you down!

160
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,350
- Move us in closer!
- We can't, the brush is too thick.

161
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,770
Kalifa, we have to move, hurry.

162
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,150
Please, Ahsoka, leave me.

163
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,610
- I won't.
- You have to.

164
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,620
Ahsoka, please take care...

165
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:28,130
I'll take care of the others.

166
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,530
I know you will.

167
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll kill you! You killed my son!

168
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,520
I'll kill you!

169
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,690
You can't hide from me!

170
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:11,370
- What is Ahsoka's strength?
- She is fearless.

171
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,040
That can also be a weakness.

172
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,960
Is she a worthy apprentice?

173
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:21,420
No one has her kind of determination.

174
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,420
Except you.

175
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,050
I'll find her.

176
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,970
This may not be within your power.

177
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:35,740
Whatever you're trying to say, Master Plo,
just say it.

178
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:41,900
I am suggesting that perhaps,
if you have trained her well,

179
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,990
she shall take care of herself,
and find a way back to you.
