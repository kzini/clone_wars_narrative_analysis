1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,450
Trapped behind enemy lines!

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,000
Carrying secret information
vital to the Republic's war effort,

3
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,670
Jedi Master Even Piell and Captain Tarkin
were taken prisoner by the Separatists.

4
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,050
An elite strike team, led by
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,970
landed on the planet Lola Sayu
and infiltrated the prison.

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,390
The team rescued Master Piell and Tarkin,

7
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,220
but they were pursued by the prison's
evil commandant Osi Sobeck.

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,480
During the escape,
their ship was destroyed.

9
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:47,390
Now we find them on the run,

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,480
desperate to escape the trap
that is the citadel.

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,660
We're clear!

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,160
What's our next move?

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,660
We're going to have to
fight our way off this rock.

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:09,040
Contact the Council,
see when they plan to rescue us.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,420
I'll handle it.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,680
Master Piell, it's good to see you alive,
my friend.

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,220
Likewise, Master Windu.

18
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,020
Our escape route has been compromised

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,390
and there are several squads of droids
closing in on us.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,020
When can we expect your arrival?

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
Master Plo is already en route.

22
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,950
Gunships will arrive
to evacuate you and your men,

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,570
but do not delay,

24
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,530
only a small window of opportunity
shall we have.

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,360
Your rendezvous point will be this island.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,630
Understood.

27
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,740
May the Force be with you.

28
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,540
Incoming!

29
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,940
No doubt there's more on the way.

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,370
Count Dooku, My Lord.

31
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,210
Commander Sobeck, you've been
avoiding my transmissions.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,170
My deepest respect.

33
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,760
I was hoping to surprise you
with good news.

34
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,470
Good news would indeed be a surprise.

35
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,890
Have the prisoners been captured?

36
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,720
Not yet, My Lord.

37
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,020
But we've located their position
and my droids are moving in now.

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,480
I need not remind you that the prisoners
are carrying secret hyperspace coordinates

39
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:03,070
into the core systems of the Republic
and our Separatist home worlds.

40
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,200
This information will allow us to launch
a surprise attack on Coruscant,

41
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,080
striking a crippling blow to the Republic
and the Jedi.

42
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:17,420
Yes, My Lord. I will see to it
that they are soon back in our possession.

43
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,260
You should know, Commander,

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,300
right now your honesty is the only thing
keeping you alive.

45
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:41,860
They're boxing us in!

46
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,860
Lock in your cables!

47
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,820
Artoo, we need your droids
to hold off the enemy as long as possible.

48
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,580
Good. Everybody, follow me!

49
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,460
This is sheer madness!

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,510
We understand, sir.

51
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,010
We will delay the enemy
as long as possible.

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,890
Prepare for attack.

53
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,930
It was an honor to serve under you, sir.

54
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,320
Keep moving!

55
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,560
All for one and one for...

56
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,790
Keep moving, keep moving!

57
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,350
Master Tiin, you should be leading
the fighter attack.

58
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,150
Once you punch a hole
through their defenses,

59
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,860
I will lead the gunships down to
the surface and extract the team.

60
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,860
Depending on the size of their force,

61
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,740
I don't know how much time
we can buy you.

62
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,240
You will do your best, I'm sure.

63
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,960
If the team isn't at the extraction point
when you arrive,

64
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,880
you may be forced to leave them,
or put us all at risk.

65
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,170
I'm afraid Master Gallia is right.

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,020
They'll be there.

67
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,430
The prisoners have evaded us long enough.

68
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,140
Bring out the anoobas!
Use them for tracking only!

69
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,030
Contact me as soon as the fugitives
have been located.

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,240
Roger, roger.

71
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,600
What if your Jedi friends are not there
when we arrive?

72
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:15,140
Keep moving and you won't
have to worry about that, Tarkin.

73
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,730
Why did Master Piell have to share
half of the intel with that guy?

74
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,320
It's like he's not even grateful
we rescued him.

75
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,940
Captain Tarkin feels the Jedi should be

76
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,450
relieved from the burden
of leading the war effort.

77
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:32,410
That's ridiculous.

78
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,280
Maybe, but we aren't soldiers,
we're peacekeepers.

79
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,250
The Jedi code often prevents us from
going far enough to achieve victory.

80
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:42,710
A rather simple point of view.

81
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,500
Either way, he is a good captain.

82
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,800
Did you hear that?

83
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,050
Yes. We're going to have company.

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Commander, the additional reinforcements
have arrived.

85
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,030
Tighten your grip, K2-B4.

86
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,540
The Republic will almost certainly attempt
a second mission

87
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,620
to infiltrate our defenses
and rescue the prisoners.

88
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,090
I'm counting on you to ensure
that nothing slips past our blockade.

89
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,560
You know, it's not wise
to argue with Master Piell.

90
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,780
It's certainly not a good career move.

91
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,280
General Skywalker,
I stand by my principles. No matter what.

92
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:49,410
Besides, I needn't worry about my career.

93
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,400
I've fallen into favor with the Chancellor.

94
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,740
He shall support me.

95
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,120
I happen to know the Chancellor
quite well, myself.

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,490
Oh... Really?

97
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,370
Really.

98
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,040
Let's keep moving.

99
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,380
If we're not at the rendezvous
at the exact time, we'll miss our window.

100
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,260
Those creatures are gaining.

101
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,930
If they've caught our scent,
they'll lead the droids right to us.

102
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,890
We're gonna have to deal with them.

103
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,270
What about using this cave
to surprise them?

104
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,560
If we can get them to pass by,
we can attack them from behind.

105
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,400
But we need a distraction.

106
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,150
Leave that to me.

107
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,110
And Obi-Wan, of course.

108
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,280
Okay, the rest of you, follow me.

109
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,530
Keep going!
Ahsoka and I will take care of the droids.

110
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,950
Master Piell!

111
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,710
I have to get help.

112
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,550
No. Don't leave.

113
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,720
Listen to me carefully, child.

114
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:52,140
The information, I need you to
deliver it back to the Council.

115
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,600
I should find Anakin or Obi-Wan.

116
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,310
They need to hear this.

117
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,730
No. You must listen.

118
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,990
But I wasn't assigned to the team.

119
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,820
I lied just so I could be
a part of the mission.

120
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,840
Whether you were meant to be
on this mission or not,

121
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,410
you are now the most important part of it.

122
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,080
Remember this.

123
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:19,000
And see to it that the information
I'm about to give you

124
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:23,670
is revealed to no one but the Jedi Council.

125
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,140
Sir! The anoobas have located the fugitives
along the northern shore.

126
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:37,690
Squad, come with me!
I will deal with this personally.

127
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,820
So much for the hunting party.

128
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,820
There are more squads on their way.

129
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,550
Oh, no.

130
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,180
He died honorably.

131
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,020
What about the information?

132
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,440
I have it. He told me just before he died.

133
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,250
We don't have much time.

134
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:35,410
Let's take this moment to honor him,
then we must move on.

135
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,960
He would have wanted us
to complete our mission.

136
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,810
There have not been battles like these
since the days of the Old Republic.

137
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,610
Indeed. Good hunting.

138
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,860
There's the extraction point.

139
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,930
Incoming!

140
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,550
Look what I found!

141
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,240
They are too many droid fighters.

142
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,530
We need more time
to break through the blockade.

143
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,910
We're out of time, Master Tiin.
We must break through now.

144
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,290
Very well. Wing commanders form up.
We're going in.

145
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,010
Captain!

146
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,930
If I can't have the information,
it will die with you.

147
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,690
My thanks, Padawan Tano.

148
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:38,030
I see you've trained her well.

149
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,820
The rescue ship should be here by now.

150
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,330
So should the rest of the Separatist army!

151
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,050
I believe you've worn out your welcome.

152
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,820
Admiral Coburn, we have the survivors.
Recall all fighters.

153
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,990
Yes, General.
Prepare to jump to light speed.

154
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,600
We're all ready, Admiral.

155
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,150
Of Master Piell's loss,
we are sorry to hear.

156
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,270
He will be missed.

157
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,650
Because of his great sacrifice,
we now have the Nexus Route coordinates.

158
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:46,740
Captain Tarkin and Ahsoka
have each memorized half.

159
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,700
Debrief them both, we must.

160
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,790
With all due respect, Master Jedi,

161
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,970
I was instructed by Chancellor Palpatine

162
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,790
to bring the intel directly to him
for debriefing.

163
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,890
I promised Master Piell that
I would deliver it only to the Council.

164
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,260
And that's what I will do.

165
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Hmm...

166
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,310
Personally meet with the Chancellor, I
will. Decide what is best to do, we shall.

167
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,230
Master Plo, there's something
we want to ask you.

168
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,980
Did you assign Ahsoka to the mission?

169
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,280
It appears I did.

170
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,290
A job well done, General Skywalker.

171
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,920
I wish more Jedi
had your military sensibilities.

172
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:48,680
Perhaps I can inform the Chancellor
of your valor.

173
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,310
I'm not sure what to
think of your new ally.

174
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,650
Well, I think we need people like him.

This is a war. If we aren't willing to do
what it takes to win,

176
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,690
we risk losing everything
we try to protect.

177
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,950
Unfortunately, war tends to distort
our point of view.

178
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,700
If we sacrifice our code, even for victory,

179
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,370
we may lose that which is most important,
our honor.
