1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,950
Escape from a Separatist prison!

2
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,740
Carrying information about secret routes

3
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,750
into the heart of the Republic
and Separatist home worlds,

4
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,790
Jedi Master Even Piell was captured,

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,750
and imprisoned in a fortress
known as the Citadel.

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:31,500
Leading an elite strike team,

7
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,050
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker
rescued Master Piell and his officers.

8
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,550
Now the Jedi have split up
to evade Separatist forces

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,060
as they attempt to escape the Citadel...

10
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,070
Artoo, are you and your battle droids
ready to go?

11
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,710
All right, get the ship fired up,

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,660
we'll meet you at the pipeline exit
after you've picked Obi-Wan,

13
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,530
assuming he's still on schedule.

14
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,660
This passage will
get us near the landing pad.

15
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,890
Artoo, send the shuttle to
the rear landing platform.

16
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,690
We've already been given the go-ahead
by General Skywalker, sir.

17
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,400
Assuming you are still on schedule.

18
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,480
The trick will be if
Anakin arrives on time.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,780
A probe!

20
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,540
Did you get it?

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,420
Security doors!
Move or you'll be cut in half!

22
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,690
I can't!

23
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,560
We lost one.
Looks like we've got some cutting to do.

24
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,700
Count Dooku insists that you
speak with him, Commander.

25
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,240
Well, let's not keep him waiting.

26
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,450
He's already waiting, sir.

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,380
Count Dooku, my lord. How unexpected.

28
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,630
You may cease the propriety,
Commander Sobeck.

29
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,060
I understand there is a problem
with the Jedi prisoner.

30
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,890
An incursion team attempted a rescue,
but the situation is taken care of.

31
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,980
Are you in possession of the information
the prisoner is carrying?

32
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,810
Not yet. But we will soon have it.

33
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,980
You are aware that this information will

34
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:42,570
tip the scale of the war to
the side that controls it.

35
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:47,160
Perhaps, this is a matter that
requires my presence?

36
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,410
No, my lord.

37
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,160
Find them, Commander.
Get the information,

38
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,130
then kill them all.

39
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,090
Don't ever surprise me with
a transmission from Count Dooku!

40
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,130
I need time to prepare!

41
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,180
Yes, Commander.

42
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,710
I am beginning to admire
the design of this fortress.

43
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,880
It's rather formidable to evade.

44
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,090
How can you admire such a horrible place?

45
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,430
Ah, you reveal your short-sightedness.

46
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,890
This ordeal only demonstrates how
effective facilities like the Citadel are.

47
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,190
Pity it ended up in Separatist hands
and not ours.

48
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,520
He has a point.

49
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,030
All right, Snips,
I need you to lead the group.

50
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,400
Keep following the tunnel. I'll catch up.

51
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:07,200
Hey, where are you going?

52
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,570
Obi-Wan's not here,
so someone has to protect our flank.

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,790
I guess it's a good thing I came along
after all.

54
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,710
We've received a coded transmission.

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,590
Apparently they've split up
into two groups.

56
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,140
The rendezvous points are
the landing field behind the tower

57
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,260
where Artoo will pick up Obi-Wan Kenobi,

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,480
and the pipeline exit
where they'll find Anakin Skywalker.

59
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,480
And what if things
don't go according to plan?

60
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,110
Then we would have to send an entire fleet
to get them out of there.

61
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:53,160
I am concerned that the Jedi have
elected this child to lead the group.

62
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,870
I've served with her many times
and I trust her, Captain.

63
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,250
Uh-oh.

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,210
Dead end.

65
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,550
It looks like
there are security guards there.

66
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,060
Okay, boss, we'll land and wait
for General Kenobi.

67
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,540
Uh-oh. That doesn't look like
General Kenobi.

68
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,790
We'll have to improvise.

69
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,460
Your arrival is long overdue,
where have you been?

70
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,010
Even so, the odds are 3-to-1
that you are a traitor.

71
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,100
We will take you to interrogation below.

72
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,060
Yes, sir. Move it!

73
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,610
Don't talk back to me,
droid. I'm in charge.

74
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,400
We have captured the shuttle

75
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,860
that infiltrated our defenses.

76
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,540
Good, guard the shuttle
and we'll lure the Jedi into a trap.

77
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,390
Sorry, Commander. Just wanted to
fool them. What are your orders?

78
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:40,560
You're right! If we're not at the shuttle,

79
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,390
General Kenobi could be
walking into a trap!

80
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,810
We'll try to locate them
if they get captured.

81
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,710
Look out!

82
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,750
What happened?
Why didn't you blow the wall?

83
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,090
That part of the plan was your job!

84
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,640
I thought it was a dead end.

85
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,440
If Master Plo really assigned you
to this mission,

86
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,000
he would have briefed you on the plan.

87
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,640
The shuttle's there
but there's no sign of Artoo.

88
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:01,260
Something might have happened.

89
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,576
We'll have to make our way around to

90
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,890
the other side and get a different view.

91
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,640
This could be a trap.

92
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,160
Anakin?

93
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,540
I must commend you on
your escape tactics,

94
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,330
but in the end it was easy to

95
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,130
predict your every move.

96
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,700
This pipe leads up to the top of the ridge,

97
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,860
where Artoo will pick us up
and get us out of here.

98
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,660
There's the hatch.

99
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go! Let's go! Everyone in.
Don't use your lights,

100
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,840
and make sure your weapons are locked.

101
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,680
The slightest electronic pulse could
ignite this whole tube.

102
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,760
I hope somebody tells the droids that.

103
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,120
Welcome back.

104
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:34,120
I must say, you're not at all what I pictured
for someone who has such a soft voice.

105
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,130
I want your half
of the information.

106
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,220
Give it to me now,
or I'll start executing your men.

107
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,760
This is war, Sobeck.

108
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,140
They're all prepared to die
to protect that intel.

109
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,140
Really?

110
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,950
Sir, we have located the other group
and our droids are closing in on them.

111
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,370
Your Jedi resolve
only delays the inevitable.

112
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,960
Take them to Interrogation.
Torture them slowly.

113
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,970
So they were captured, huh?

114
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,180
And now they're moving them to
the prison block?

115
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,980
Yes, sir! We will move to intercept them.

116
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,360
We'll take them from here.

117
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,990
Uh, I think we have a...

118
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,450
We'll handle it.

119
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,330
Yes, sir!

120
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,390
Good to see you, Artoo.
I wondered where you've been.

121
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,900
The Commander is pleased to
see you as well, sir,

122
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,650
but would like to return to the shuttle
as soon as possible.

123
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,140
Yes, I couldn't agree more.

124
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,400
What about General Skywalker, sir?

125
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,070
Not to worry, he'll switch to plan B.

126
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:44,710
How much longer are we going to
wander through this tunnel in the dark?

127
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,260
Captain Tarkin,
haven't you learned to trust me by now?

128
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,390
You may have earned my trust,
General Skywalker,

129
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,100
but my faith in your comrades
is still lacking.

130
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,680
You lack faith in the Jedi.

131
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,230
I find their tactics ineffective.

132
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:02,060
The Jedi code prevents them from
going far enough to achieve victory.

133
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,230
To do whatever it takes to win.

134
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,900
The very reason why
peace keepers should not be leading a war.

135
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,780
Have I offended you?

136
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,530
No. I've also found that

137
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,040
we sometimes fall short of victory
because of our methods.

138
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,790
Well, I see we agree on something.

139
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,970
I think I found a way out.

140
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,020
What do you see, Snips?

141
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,850
The coast is clear.

142
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,810
Any sign of Obi-Wan and the shuttle?

143
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:45,150
No, I don't see him or Artoo anywhere.

144
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,490
We've got to go!

145
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,950
There could be
a whole battalion of droids out there!

146
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,540
Better than hiding in a fuel line.

147
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,560
The plan's been compromised.
The shuttle's not coming.

148
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,820
Throw me a charge!

149
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:47,550
Let's go! Time for plan B.

150
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,250
There's a plan B?

151
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,220
There's always a backup plan.
We'll meet Artoo at Obi-Wan's position.

152
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,560
Based on their recent position,

153
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,350
we believe they're traveling
along this cave system.

154
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,610
Uh, sir, the prisoners did not make it to
the interrogation level.

155
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,900
What did you just say?

156
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,410
Um, we think they might have...

157
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:21,200
Sir, Count Dooku commands you to
contact him immediately.

158
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:33,210
Inform Count Dooku that I am unreachable.
Send all units to the airfield.

159
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,300
It's their only possible way of escape.

160
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,440
Hold it!
Where are you going with these prisoners?

161
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,460
We're transferring them
aboard the shuttle.

162
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,110
From Citadel to Point Tarron.

163
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,780
Point Tarron? There's no outpost there.

164
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,670
Uh, it's new.

165
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,790
We have orders. We're coming aboard.

166
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,250
Wait.

167
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
The prisoners are escaping

168
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,800
with reprogrammed battle droids.

169
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,300
Let no one on board that shuttle.

170
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,670
Sorry I'm late.

171
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,340
How nice of you to join us!

172
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,010
The ship is surrounded!

173
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,760
We need to launch a full-forward assault
and take that vessel!

174
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,520
We may have a bigger problem.
Those turrets. If we don't take them out,

175
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,680
they will use them to destroy the shuttle
and prevent our escape.

176
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:11,600
Which is precisely why
we should get aboard that shuttle,

177
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,520
and use the weapon systems to
decimate those droids.

178
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Whatever we're going to do,
we better do it fast.

179
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,020
General Skywalker,
a droid is manning one of those turrets.

180
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,030
They're going to blow up the shuttle, sir.

181
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,750
This is our only chance.
We've got to stop him.

182
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,670
Echo, look out!

183
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,970
Echo!

184
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,270
We have to go now!

185
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,240
Master Kenobi, what has happened?

186
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,240
I'm afraid we've had a situation
with the shuttle.

187
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,830
By "situation," he means big explosion.

188
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,420
We're going to need a rescue.

189
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,590
It will be done.
I'm sending our cruisers now.

190
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,610
We'll need to hold out
until the Council sends a ship.

191
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,440
Not a problem. We've beat them once,
we'll beat them again.

192
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,370
This landscape is
almost impossible to cross.

193
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,090
How are we going to get to
the rendezvous point?

194
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,290
That is the trap of the Citadel.

195
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,420
It was designed so it would be
almost impossible

196
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,670
for fugitives to get off the surface,

197
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,460
even if they escaped the tower.

198
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,510
Lucky we're not just any fugitives.

199
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,640
I hope you're right.
