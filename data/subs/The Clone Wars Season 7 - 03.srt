1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,183
Trapped.

2
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:20,270
On an unsanctioned mission
to rescue ARC trooper Echo,

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:24,774
General Skywalker, Captain Rex,
and the Bad Batch travel to Skako Minor,

4
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,526
headquarters of the Techno Union.

5
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,070
After a harrowing encounter
with the natives,

6
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,489
our heroes infiltrate the city of Purkoll,

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:35,201
only to find themselves
surrounded by Wat Tambor's forces.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,423
Hey!

9
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,386
Hunter, hold them off.
I'll check on Rex and Echo.

10
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,894
Situation's almost under control
out there.

11
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,645
How's it going in here?

12
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,774
I'm still trying to decrypt
Echo's cerebral interface.

13
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:09,361
Until I do, we cannot disconnect him
from this computer system.

14
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,695
How is he, Rex?

15
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,364
He's too weak to walk.

16
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,825
Very disoriented.
Doesn't even remember how he got here.

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,578
He remembers being at the Citadel,
but that's about it.

18
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,413
Any word on the extraction squad?

19
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,249
We called it in, but no word back.

20
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,129
Well, that's no surprise.

21
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,632
We knew when we got into this
we'd be on our own.

22
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,930
It's gonna get more difficult
to get out of here.

23
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,265
There are several squads of droids
closing in.

24
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,508
Enemy approaching. Droids-- lots of 'em.

25
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,218
How long can you hold them off?

26
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,636
How long do you need?

27
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,847
Tech, how much longer?

28
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,807
Not yet. I need more time.

29
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,609
We have them
completely surrounded, sir.

30
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,028
Good.

31
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,280
Send in the Decimator.

32
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,218
I've got it.

33
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,720
We can unplug him now.

34
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,070
-Rex?
-What is it?

35
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,616
I got a big headache.

36
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,203
Better to feel something than nothing,
old buddy.

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,498
It's a touching reunion, guys,
but we need to get out of here now.

38
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:33,171
There's an exhaust vent that leads
to the cooling systems right there.

39
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,263
They've breached the front door.

40
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,265
It won't be long
before they're through the second.

41
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,645
That should get it open.

42
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,905
Great. Now how do we get up there?

43
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,116
I can help with that.

44
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,368
Wait, what?

45
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,954
Wrecker, what are you doing?

46
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,749
A heads-up would've been nice!

47
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,584
The door's nearly breached, sir.

48
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,546
Whoa!

49
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,348
It's okay, Wrecker. I've got this.

50
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,481
What are you doing?

51
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:36,651
I'm putting an end
to Tambor's little science experiment.

52
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,281
Are you done? Time's up.

53
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,827
Whoa! Whoa! Oh, no!

54
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,579
What is that thing?

55
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,581
I don't like it! I don't like it!

56
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,292
It's trying to get me! Whoa!

57
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,847
What happened? Why did it shut off?

58
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,809
No organic targets were detected, sir.

59
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,395
The room appears to be empty.

60
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,315
Oh, no.

61
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,450
Orders, sir?

62
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,671
They took it-- Techno Union property!

63
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,174
They've ruined years of research.

64
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:43,802
Find them!

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,641
Huh. This ventilation corridor
acts as a cooling system

66
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,768
for all the computers in the facility.

67
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,895
How did you know it was up here, Echo?

68
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:56,147
Well, they got access to my memory,

69
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,318
and I got access
to the Techno Union database.

70
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,531
All their plans, inventory,
building schematics-- everything.

71
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,450
You mean you can find us
a safe way out of here?

72
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,828
Well, there is a way,

73
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,913
but you're not gonna like it.

74
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,266
I don't know about this.

75
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:41,943
I'm telling you, there's a landing pad
on that other building.

76
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,320
So you think
there's a ship there we can steal?

77
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,906
Well, I hope there's a ship we can steal.

78
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,701
Let's hope this trip isn't for nothing.

79
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,675
Oh, boy. I can't even look.

80
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,927
Just keep walking, Tech.

81
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:11,014
That's fine, but if you fall,
don't take me with you.

82
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,683
Uh-oh. I looked. Ahh!

83
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,353
I think I'm gonna be sick.
Not gonna panic.

84
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,605
Hang on, Wrecker. We're almost there.

85
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,358
Gonna be okay. Breathe.

86
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,613
Turn around! Go back!

87
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,502
Whoa. Wh-Whoa!

88
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,629
Oh, boy. Gotcha!

89
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,424
Anybody got a brilliant idea?

90
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,009
I do have a brilliant idea.

91
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,302
I'm hanging here!

92
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,847
When the locals attacked us,
I recorded the creatures' distress call.

93
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,475
He records everything. It's a hobby.

94
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,978
Which allows us to call
those flying creatures to us.

95
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,235
Ow! Enough with the sound!

96
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,695
Take that!

97
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,698
There is our ride out of here!

98
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:17,414
Now, how do we get on them?

99
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,332
How else? We jump!

100
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,504
All right, I'll go first.

101
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,389
I don't wanna do this, but here I go!

102
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,393
See you later!

103
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,904
Uh, that wasn't part of the plan.

104
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,823
Those things can fly!

105
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,963
We have to shake those droids!

106
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,590
How do I steer this thing?

107
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,601
How you holding up, Echo?

108
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:22,187
Never better, sir!

109
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:44,209
Their leader is impressed
we tamed the Keeradaks,

110
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,586
but he wants to know why we returned here.

111
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:51,591
Tell him we had no choice. Tell him...
that we wore out our welcome in Purkoll.

112
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:10,985
Not good.

113
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,405
If I know Tambor, he'll come after us,

114
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:16,157
us and the Poletecs,
with everything he's got.

115
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,621
What's he saying, Tech?

116
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,457
He says that we have broken our word.

117
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,168
We have brought the war to his village.

118
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,629
You're right. Tell him he's right, Tech.

119
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,425
Tell him we didn't plan
to drag his people into war.

120
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:36,261
But look what the Separatists did
to one of our people!

121
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,643
They took away his freedom, his humanity.

122
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,354
They tried to turn him into a machine.

123
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,990
The Techno Union claims it's neutral,

124
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,075
but they have chosen sides.

125
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,953
Now your people have to choose.

126
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,705
Couldn't have said it better, Rex.

127
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,624
Ugh! Let's hope it works,

128
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,127
because I see forces coming--

129
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,755
more than we can handle alone.

130
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:26,186
-Report.
-The clones are hiding among the natives.

131
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:30,732
Take the reinforcements
and bring back my experiment.

132
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,543
Rex, we've gotta take out these walkers.

133
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,336
I'll take one. You take the other.

134
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,089
Don't worry, General.
The boys and I can handle it.

135
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,924
Hunter, Wrecker, you're with me.

136
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,568
Still showing off, huh, General?

137
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,111
You know me, Echo.

138
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,505
That seemed to work.
But how do we get up there?

139
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,758
No, no. Not again!

140
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,820
It's hard to compete with a Jedi.

141
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:33,076
Sir, the attack force has failed.

142
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,996
Aw, the loss of the clone
is a devastating blow

143
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,083
to the Techno Union's profit margin.

144
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:43,586
Should we inform the Separatists
of our loss?

145
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,922
All in good time.

146
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:49,634
We must find a way
to recoup on our investment.

147
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:57,225
Thank you for helping us in our fight.

148
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:07,861
He said the Jedi will always have an ally
here on Skako Minor.

149
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,284
Rex.

150
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,870
Thanks for coming after me.

151
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,122
That's what brothers do.

152
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,541
I'm just sorry it took so long.

153
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,085
Hopefully,
it's gonna be just like old times.

154
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,303
Yeah.

155
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,096
Just like old times.
