1
00:00:20,998 --> 00:00:22,053
Reunited.

2
00:00:22,615 --> 00:00:24,256
With the help of the Bad Batch,

3
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:27,735
Captain Rex rescues his 
old friend, ARC Trooper Echo,

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,186
from the Techno Union.

5
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:32,311
The separatist loss of Echo's 
strategic algorithm

6
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:35,090
 provides a chance for 
the Republic to turn the tide

7
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:36,756
in the battle for Anaxis.

8
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,584
However, Echo's horrifying 
experience behind enemy lines

9
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,794
 leaves lingering questions 
of his true loyalty

10
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,560
and uncertain future.

11
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,249
We have more than a dozen 
active battlefronts on Anaxis,

12
00:01:02,428 --> 00:01:04,480
and we are losing nearly every one.

13
00:01:05,392 --> 00:01:08,598
But, if Admiral Trench can no 
longer anticipate our moves,

14
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:11,165
we now have the opportunity to
retake the planet.

15
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,657
I can improve your chances.

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,524
Uh, excuse me, Generals.

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,736
Echo, I'm sorry,

18
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:25,123
but I just don't think 
you're ready for battle yet.

19
00:01:25,148 --> 00:01:27,148
I am not a liability, Rex.

20
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,642
I'm the best chance we have to take
back Anaxis.

21
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:34,161
If the Trooper has a plan,

22
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:35,820
I'd like to hear it.

23
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
May I?

24
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:49,182
While Master Windu leads a team 
to retake the Assembly Complex,

25
00:01:49,338 --> 00:01:52,650
the Bad Batch will escort
me into Trench's new com-port,

26
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,541
which, according to code intel,

27
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:58,766
 is now located on this separatist 
dreadnought above Anaxis.

28
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:00,891
Once I'm plugged in,

29
00:02:00,945 --> 00:02:03,163
I can feed Trench strategies,

30
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:04,562
but this time,

31
00:02:04,587 --> 00:02:07,660
you'll know every move 
before he makes it.

32
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,856
And you are certain

33
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:10,512
that if we get you on board that ship,

34
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,614
that you can convince Trench's army

35
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:13,888
to do what you want?

36
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:14,943
Absolutely.

37
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,793
Unfortunately,

38
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:18,675
I've been doing this for a while,

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,942
but this time,

40
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,950
I can help bring about a Republic victory

41
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:24,340
 instead of a defeat.

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,058
Tech, is everything ready?

43
00:02:39,183 --> 00:02:40,183
Yup, Sarge.

44
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:41,208
We are ready.

45
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,816
Still not sure how we're 
gonna land on that ship.

46
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:44,691
Don't worry.

47
00:02:44,716 --> 00:02:45,940
Echo says he's got a plan.

48
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:48,755
That makes me feel so much better.

49
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,051
What do you mean by that?

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,280
To be blunt, his mind belonged to the

51
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,960
separatists until we unplugged him.

52
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,440
We don't really know 
where his loyalties lie.

53
00:02:56,755 --> 00:02:58,482
Yeah, well I know.

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,951
Now get moving.

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,345
Please tell me we are 
blowing something up!

56
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,235
Sorry, Wrecker.

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,540
This is strictly stealth.

58
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,095
I hate that word!

59
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:28,906
Echo, you're up.

60
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:30,156
Don't worry.

61
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,312
As soon as I plug in,

62
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,273
I'll send a signal to the command ship.

63
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:35,789
What type of signal are you gonna send?

64
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,616
Nothing that will give us away, right?

65
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:41,022
As far as the droids are concerned,

66
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,566
we're just gonna be another 
one of their shuttles

67
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,871
coming in for a landing.

68
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:48,441
The regs think we take risks.

69
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,913
We have an incoming ship.

70
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,077
Is this one of ours?

71
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,870
I've never seen this model.

72
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:18,427
Sending the signal.

73
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,930
Now.

74
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,429
Yep, it's one of ours.

75
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:27,700
Roger, roger, shuttle TC-159.

76
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,920
You may approach and land.

77
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,175
I'd still rather blow it up.

78
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,874
I have a feeling you'll get your chance.

79
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,941
Gold Leader, you're cleared for launch.

80
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,273
Copy that, General. We're going in.

81
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,516
Admiral Trench,

82
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:50,148
the Jedi are attacking the assembly plant

83
00:05:50,173 --> 00:05:51,654
with a large force.

84
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,830
Yes.

85
00:05:53,872 --> 00:05:58,004
Now I will use their 
arrogance and desperation

86
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,113
to our advantage.

87
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:25,029
Tech, can you rig an interface.

88
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:27,318
I assume that's a rhetorical question.

89
00:06:27,481 --> 00:06:30,418
We should make sure this comvault 
has no other entrances.

90
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:31,443
I'm on it.

91
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,738
Contact Skako.

92
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,971
I want to use the algorithm to calculate

93
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:47,080
the best possible counterattack.

94
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,956
As you command.

95
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:56,945
All right.

96
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,425
I have access to everything.

97
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,628
And good timing.

98
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:03,300
I just scanned a strategy request
Trench sent to the techno-union.

99
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,441
Wait!

100
00:07:04,473 --> 00:07:06,387
You can't just send a signal from here.

101
00:07:06,496 --> 00:07:07,425
Why not?

102
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,930
We have to make it appear as if

103
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,340
your signal is originating 
from Skako Minor.

104
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,310
Otherwise they'll know we are here.

105
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:43,043
My name is General Mace Windu 
of the Jedi Order.

106
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:45,341
At this point of the Clone War,

107
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:46,722
I have dismantled and destroyed

108
00:07:46,747 --> 00:07:49,070
over 100,000 of you
Type-1 battle droids.

109
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,303
I'm giving you an opportunity to 
peacefully lay down your weapons,

110
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,255
 so that you may be reprogrammed

111
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,895
to serve a better
purpose than spreading

112
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,545
the mindless violence and chaos

113
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,888
which you have
inflicted upon the galaxy.

114
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,710
Blast him!

115
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,239
Well, I guess it was worth a try.

116
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:32,435
Here is the new strategy 
from Skako, Admiral.

117
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,873
Mobilize all troops on Anaxis to the
Assembly Complex.

118
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,875
The Republic will not 
send reinforcements.

119
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:40,811
They will put all their faith

120
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,320
in the Jedi.

121
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,808
Give the order.

122
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:55,230
I'm intercepting a transmission.

123
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,456
Trench is ordering all of his droids

124
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,143
to the Assembly Complex.

125
00:09:01,893 --> 00:09:03,995
All right, Echo.
What are you trying to pull?

126
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,315
Don't worry.

127
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,680
That's what I told him to do.

128
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,800
But our troops will be 
vastly outnumbered.

129
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,460
Not when I send them a feedback pulse

130
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,160
that shuts down all the droids.

131
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,100
How do we know that's what 
you're really going to do?

132
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:19,793
We have to trust him.

133
00:09:20,505 --> 00:09:21,654
Rex is right.

134
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:24,380
Echo, we're all counting on you.

135
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:33,800
Master Windu, I know 
this sounds crazy, but

136
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,200
it's about to get a little more 
crowded where you are.

137
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,020
We have our hands full as it is.

138
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,736
What is your plan?

139
00:09:39,908 --> 00:09:42,020
If it makes you feel any 
better, it isn't my plan.

140
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,960
Echo is drawing all the droids to your

141
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,640
position so he can neutralize 
them all at the same time.

142
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,080
Obi-Wan, Skywalker just contacted me.

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,838
He said we've got a lot more droids
headed our way.

144
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,956
I see Anakin is being as 
insightful as ever.

145
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,699
I was told not to worry.

146
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,753
It was all part of their plan?

147
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,180
If I know Anakin, we've got the easy part.

148
00:10:18,297 --> 00:10:21,399
The droids are going to 
overwhelm the Jedi.

149
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,977
They don't stand a chance.

150
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:42,230
Well, there weren't as many as I thought
there were going to be.

151
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,099
Does this meet your expectations?

152
00:10:51,428 --> 00:10:54,029
This exceeds my expectations.

153
00:11:05,301 --> 00:11:06,903
Hey there.

154
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,949
Shutting down.

155
00:11:08,974 --> 00:11:10,535
Awaiting orders.

156
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:18,073
What?!

157
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,208
What was that?

158
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,788
We monitored a powerful energy surge,

159
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,054
which has overloaded the droid circuitry.

160
00:11:26,673 --> 00:11:29,833
We are tracking the 
origin of this pulse now.

161
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,660
I am pleased to report that we are

162
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,388
in control of the assembly complex,

163
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,747
and all other fronts are 
falling to the Republic,

164
00:11:35,772 --> 00:11:37,193
 thanks to Echo's plan.

165
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,240
That's good news, Master Windu.

166
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:41,085
We're on our way back to the base.

167
00:11:41,147 --> 00:11:42,366
May the Force be with you.

168
00:11:42,764 --> 00:11:43,999
Good job, Echo.

169
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,631
Well, I guess you 
actually are on our side.

170
00:11:47,303 --> 00:11:49,124
Was there ever any doubt?

171
00:11:49,838 --> 00:11:50,838
Some?

172
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,287
Well, thanks.

173
00:11:54,503 --> 00:11:55,599
Come on, brother.

174
00:11:55,624 --> 00:11:57,080
Unplug and let's get out of here.

175
00:11:57,661 --> 00:12:00,553
The algorithm has never 
been wrong before.

176
00:12:01,311 --> 00:12:03,451
How could we have missed this?

177
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:06,420
The source originated on board this ship.

178
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,974
Dispatch security droids.

179
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:11,052
What about our apparent defeat?

180
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,860
A wise leader does not rely completely on

181
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,914
things such as algorithms.

182
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:26,360
My personal strategy for victory
is through total annihilation.

183
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Wait.

184
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,637
I just scanned a new order from Trench.

185
00:12:31,113 --> 00:12:32,573
He's initiated a countdown.

186
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,120
There's a bomb,

187
00:12:34,238 --> 00:12:36,105
hidden at the assembly complex.

188
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,099
But it's big enough to 
destroy most of Anaxes.

189
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:40,240
Can you stop it?

190
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:43,138
Well, I can try.

191
00:12:43,466 --> 00:12:44,887
General, where are you going?

192
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,786
If you can't stop the detonation,

193
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,231
perhaps Trench can.

194
00:12:51,255 --> 00:12:52,536
You're clear.

195
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,005
Continue your sweep, Jesse.

196
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:56,683
Sir.

197
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:57,945
General Windu, this is Tech.

198
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,254
We've discovered a bomb 
in the fusion reactor.

199
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,731
We need someone to go down 
there and help disarm it.

200
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,145
I'm on my way.

201
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:10,053
Get the men out of here.

202
00:13:11,418 --> 00:13:12,775
You heard General Windu.

203
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,596
Organize your platoons and have
them evacuated as soon as possible.

204
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:16,644
Sir, yes, sir.

205
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:08,884
Ray shield.

206
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,675
Echo, I found the bomb.

207
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,669
Tell me the sequence to shut it down.

208
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,122
I'm decrypting it now.

209
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,271
You have to unplug.

210
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:17,630
They're going to detect us.

211
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,177
No, no, we need these codes.

212
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,305
The first number in 
the sequence is three.

213
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:30,778
The next is one.

214
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,360
Eight.

215
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,605
We have located the source of the pulse.

216
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Seven.

217
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:44,324
Jam the signal at its source.

218
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:45,655
They're on to us.

219
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,032
We need to unplug now.

220
00:14:52,055 --> 00:14:53,055
Echo.

221
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,880
The server overloaded its neural system.

222
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,540
And it appears deliberate.

223
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:57,101
Echo!

224
00:14:57,126 --> 00:14:58,986
That means Trench knows we're here.

225
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,560
Echo, are you there?

226
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,688
General Windu, Trench took out Echo.

227
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,800
We can't get to the last number in
the sequence.

228
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
Sorry, General.

229
00:15:07,226 --> 00:15:08,969
You'll have to disarm 
that bomb without us.

230
00:15:08,994 --> 00:15:10,243
Don't worry about me, Captain.

231
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,665
Just get your men out of there.

232
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:12,751
Yes, sir.

233
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,272
We got company.

234
00:15:28,913 --> 00:15:32,580
The Jedi lacks the final 
sequences to stop

235
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:33,872
the detonation.

236
00:15:34,781 --> 00:15:37,100
The loss of clones at the shipyard will

237
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,020
seal the Republic's fate.

238
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:43,640
Dispatch more units to deal
with the infiltrators on the ship.

239
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,900
And prepare our landing 
craft for our next assault.

240
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:49,900
As you command.

241
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,020
Jedi scum.

242
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,820
Tell me the sequence 
to disarm the bomb.

243
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:16,984
Never.

244
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,172
Dooku would kill me for losing Anaxes.

245
00:16:21,305 --> 00:16:22,800
And you think I won't?

246
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:25,234
You're a Jedi.

247
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,843
Your nobility...

248
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:32,137
I don't have such weaknesses!

249
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,567
Now let's try that again.

250
00:16:43,147 --> 00:16:45,390
Mace, if you can't stop the detonation,

251
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,040
you must leave now.

252
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,813
That is not an option.

253
00:16:48,979 --> 00:16:50,673
I still have a chance to stop this,

254
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,950
even if it's down to my best guess.

255
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:55,673
How about I take the 
guesswork out of it, Master?

256
00:16:56,009 --> 00:16:58,150
Admiral Trent was kind 
enough to give me

257
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,977
the final number himself.

258
00:17:00,128 --> 00:17:01,128
Try seven.

259
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,615
Good work, Skywalker.

260
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,390
The bomb has been disarmed.

261
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,342
You both owe me one now.

262
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:42,995
Wrecker is gonna love this.

263
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,780
Admiral, it was a pleasure.

264
00:17:59,732 --> 00:18:01,396
Hey! Fire!

265
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,490
Can't blast our way out.

266
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:08,769
There's too many of them.

267
00:18:16,534 --> 00:18:17,885
What's he doing?

268
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,143
Time to release the wrecking ball!

269
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,846
Yeah!

270
00:18:26,674 --> 00:18:27,674
Hey!

271
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,205
I honestly feel bad for those droids.

272
00:18:38,662 --> 00:18:40,302
It's all clear.

273
00:18:40,469 --> 00:18:41,850
Please, not the face.

274
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,490
Not the face.

275
00:18:49,511 --> 00:18:50,591
More droids.

276
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:51,631
Go.

277
00:18:51,656 --> 00:18:53,176
I'll buy you some time.

278
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,960
Stickey.

279
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:05,029
We'll meet you at the infiltration point.

280
00:19:06,141 --> 00:19:07,352
Oh.

281
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,120
He's gonna try and top me.

282
00:19:09,471 --> 00:19:10,811
You watch.

283
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,083
This is the infiltration point.

284
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,633
I'm picking up dozens of 
droids on my sensors,

285
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,123
all heading this way.

286
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,485
Hope you're not waiting on me.

287
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:37,102
Now all we're missing is Crosshair.

288
00:19:43,805 --> 00:19:44,933
You miss me?

289
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,516
How touching.

290
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,124
Relax, Wrecker.

291
00:20:05,435 --> 00:20:07,175
You'll top him next time.

292
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,797
No, he won't.

293
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,770
I've got a present for you, Wrecker.

294
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,431
Oh, seriously?

295
00:20:24,691 --> 00:20:25,751
I get to blow it up?

296
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:27,753
The whole stinkin' thing?

297
00:20:31,934 --> 00:20:37,043
This is the happiest day of my life.

298
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:57,597
Captain Rex, Corporal Echo 
and Clone Force 99.

299
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,349
You have all done a great 
service for the Republic.

300
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,113
Thanks to your courage and effort,

301
00:21:02,238 --> 00:21:05,245
Republic shipyards will soon 
be up and running again.

302
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,753
You've got some medals 
coming your way.

303
00:21:08,286 --> 00:21:09,286
Thank you, General.

304
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:16,515
You coming?

305
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,120
Not really our thing.

306
00:21:19,518 --> 00:21:20,529
Accolades.

307
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,580
Yeah, we're just in it for the thrill.

308
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:24,949
Go!

309
00:21:25,057 --> 00:21:27,322
You sure it's your thing?

310
00:21:28,442 --> 00:21:29,442
What do you mean?

311
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,060
Your path is different.

312
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,655
Like ours.

313
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:37,361
If you ever feel like you 
don't fit in with them,

314
00:21:37,611 --> 00:21:40,033
well, find us.

315
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,870
Those are some of 
the finest troopers I've

316
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,446
ever fought alongside.

317
00:21:52,046 --> 00:21:53,085
Echo,

318
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:55,902
you and I go way back.

319
00:21:56,866 --> 00:22:00,046
If that's where you feel your place is,

320
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,684
then that's where you belong.
