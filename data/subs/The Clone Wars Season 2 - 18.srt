1
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:19,727
Desperate times call
for desperate measures!

2
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:22,527
In one of the longest
and fiercest battles of the war,

3
00:00:22,608 --> 00:00:26,448
Separatist forces are on the verge
of claiming the planet Malastare.

4
00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:28,448
If the Republic loses this planet,

5
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:33,489
it will cost them vital fuel resources
necessary for maintaining their armies.

6
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:36,290
In a final effort
to turn the tide of this battle,

7
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,010
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine
has authorized

8
00:00:39,092 --> 00:00:43,172
the use of the Republic's newest weapon,
the electro-proton bomb.

9
00:00:44,052 --> 00:00:48,133
Now at the imperial palace of Doge Urus,
the leader of the Dugs,

10
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,853
the Jedi count down the minutes

11
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:53,014
until the detonation
of their doomsday device.

12
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,056
That's a lot of clankers.

13
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:19,179
I won't allow my people
to become Separatist slaves.

14
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,220
I assure you, Doge Urus,
that will not happen.

15
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:23,460
Dr. Boll has stated

16
00:01:23,502 --> 00:01:27,342
that only droids will be affected
by the bomb's electron field.

17
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,343
Yes. The clones and your people
will be quite safe.

18
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:34,343
We have accounted
for every probable outcome.

19
00:01:34,383 --> 00:01:37,624
It's the improbable
that concerns me, Doctor.

20
00:01:37,745 --> 00:01:39,504
There must be other options.

21
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:44,465
I'm afraid not.
This bomb is our only hope for victory now.

22
00:01:45,187 --> 00:01:47,306
The droids are on the move.

23
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:51,787
Go! Go!

24
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,189
We just need to hold them back
until the bomb drops.

25
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:07,510
Blast them!

26
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:20,874
Hold the line!

27
00:02:21,994 --> 00:02:23,914
We've got fighters inbound!

28
00:02:33,957 --> 00:02:35,356
Tell the bombers to take off.

29
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,526
Approaching drop zone.

30
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:27,168
Everyone, stay tight.

31
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:29,888
Remember,
you've only got one shot at this.

32
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:31,528
Bombs away.

33
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:40,050
Uh-oh.

34
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:14,019
Here it comes!

35
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,779
I'm losing my transmission.

36
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:32,502
Well, Doc, looks like it worked.

37
00:04:36,184 --> 00:04:37,624
The ground is sinking.

38
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:43,865
Run for it!

39
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,555
The droid army was completely
neutralized by the bomb.

40
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:31,195
But the blast created a sinkhole
which engulfed many of our troopers.

41
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:33,276
We have search parties
looking for them now.

44
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:42,238
We need that treaty signed

45
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,238
so we can gain access
to the fuel reserves here on Malastare.

46
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,039
Without it, our armies shall be vulnerable.

47
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,280
I will do my best.

48
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:57,361
Sir, we have a report from the front.
They've lost contact with the rescue team.

49
00:05:58,683 --> 00:06:01,562
One problem
always seems to replace another.

50
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:12,044
I hope your bomb has not upset
the delicate balance of our planet.

51
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:26,648
You deal with the treaty and Doge Urus.
I'll help the rescue team in the crater.

52
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:51,094
Split up. If you see anything, contact me.

53
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,219
General Windu, we found them!

54
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:24,541
- We've got what we...
- We're on a very tight timeline here.

55
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:27,261
How long do you think it'll take
to get the treaty ratified?

56
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:31,942
We are waiting for two more members
of the council to arrive.

57
00:07:32,063 --> 00:07:34,143
They will sign the treaty.

58
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:36,543
We appreciate your cooperation.

59
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:39,584
Without your fuel,
our offensive will grind to a halt.

60
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:44,225
This is the beginning of a great alliance.

61
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:50,946
What happened down here, trooper?

62
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:56,228
General, there's something down here
with us, and it's not Seppies.

63
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,228
Calm yourself, soldier. We'll check it out.

64
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,909
Trapper, Ponds, Hawkeye, come with me.

65
00:08:06,631 --> 00:08:12,391
Skywalker, something strange is going on.
I think you should come down here.

66
00:08:12,512 --> 00:08:15,272
I'm on my way. Artoo, start up my fighter.

67
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:17,072
If you'll excuse me...

68
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,994
Sir, there's nothing around here
but rocks and debris.

69
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:27,434
I have a bad feeling about this.

70
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:09,684
Skywalker!

71
00:09:10,045 --> 00:09:12,085
- I'm here. What the...
We need your help!

72
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,567
Artoo, I can't see. Turn on your beacon.

73
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:26,488
Never mind.

74
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,089
What the heck is that thing?

75
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:38,451
Now's our chance. Let's go!

76
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,173
I've never seen anything like it!

77
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,460
Artoo, get out of here.

78
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:35,183
What? Uh-oh.

79
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,268
We're going to need some heavy artillery.

80
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,510
Don't worry about me, I'm all right.

81
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:11,591
- Where's your starfighter?
- That thing ate it.

82
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:14,832
That thing, it is a Zillo Beast.

83
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:19,312
They once roamed Malastare,
devouring our ancestors.

84
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:24,274
When the Dugs first started
harvesting the fuel in the planet's core,

85
00:11:24,315 --> 00:11:26,314
they were killed off.

86
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:31,155
They are supposed to be extinct.
Apparently, they're not.

87
00:11:54,321 --> 00:11:55,800
His weakness...

88
00:11:58,363 --> 00:11:59,802
What's going on out there?

89
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:03,443
It is an internal matter.
None of your concern.

90
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:09,643
- Your men are killing a unique life form.
- It is a dangerous, bloodthirsty monster!

91
00:12:10,285 --> 00:12:15,085
- Did you forget that it tried to kill you?
- It was under attack.

92
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:17,885
It had lived peacefully below the surface
for all these years.

93
00:12:18,006 --> 00:12:21,326
Until you unleashed it with your bomb!

94
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:25,047
We dropped that bomb
to save your planet, at your request!

95
00:12:25,088 --> 00:12:28,448
To save our fuel for you to buy.

96
00:12:28,529 --> 00:12:33,890
If you want us to sign your treaty,
then you must help us destroy the beast.

97
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,811
What purpose would it serve to kill it?
If it really is the last of its kind...

98
00:12:38,851 --> 00:12:40,770
It is our duty!

99
00:12:40,852 --> 00:12:44,932
Our ancestors warned us
that one would return someday

100
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:48,612
and destroy our entire civilization.

101
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:51,454
Will you help us or not?

102
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,934
I respect your traditions
and your ancestors,

103
00:12:55,975 --> 00:13:00,215
but we cannot allow the destruction
of an innocent life form.

104
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,736
Then there will be no treaty.

105
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:10,337
Master Windu,
are you certain this argument is worth it?

106
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,058
I mean, after all, it's just one creature.
Remember what the Chancellor said.

107
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:17,059
It isn't the creature. It's the principle.

108
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,140
Allowing the Dugs to kill it
violates what we stand for as Jedi.

109
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,620
But if we choose to defend the creature,

110
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,301
we lose all hope
of securing a treaty with the Dugs.

111
00:13:30,783 --> 00:13:36,543
We'll handle this our way,
no matter what these Jedi think.

112
00:13:40,985 --> 00:13:45,585
How remarkable!
I have never seen anything quite like it.

113
00:13:45,946 --> 00:13:49,466
I recommend that we transport it
off the planet as soon as possible.

114
00:13:49,547 --> 00:13:52,666
We can find a place for it to live
undisturbed in the Outer Rim.

115
00:13:53,428 --> 00:13:55,788
And what do the Dugs have to say
on this matter?

116
00:13:56,228 --> 00:13:58,548
They want us to help them destroy it.

117
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:03,309
Then by all means help them.
This creature is of no importance to us.

118
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,950
We cannot be alienating the Dugs
at this crucial time.

119
00:14:07,151 --> 00:14:10,230
It is not the Jedi way
to take an innocent life.

120
00:14:10,832 --> 00:14:14,832
- Especially if it is the last of its kind.
- Chancellor Palpatine,

121
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:18,352
I think it would be in our best interest
to study this creature.

122
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:22,753
Its outer scales are virtually impenetrable.
None of our weapons could harm it.

123
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,954
Even my lightsaber couldn't cut it.

124
00:14:25,154 --> 00:14:28,155
If we could somehow duplicate that
for our ships...

125
00:14:28,475 --> 00:14:30,355
An impenetrable armor.

126
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,756
What if we let the Dugs think we killed it?

127
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,796
Then we could have the treaty
and the creature.

128
00:14:35,877 --> 00:14:39,317
- Yes, Anakin, go on.
- When I was climbing on the creature,

129
00:14:39,398 --> 00:14:42,118
I noticed small gaps
between the armor and its scales.

130
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:45,918
Maybe a stun cannon or a pulse
could penetrate through the skin

131
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,039
and short-circuit its nervous system.
Like putting it into a deep sleep.

132
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,880
He's right. It would appear to be dead.

133
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:56,840
We could transport it to a secure location
before it wakes up.

134
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,921
The Dugs would never know
the difference.

135
00:14:59,042 --> 00:15:02,602
That may be the only way
we shall get this treaty signed

136
00:15:02,883 --> 00:15:05,643
and rest Master Windu's conscience.

137
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:24,247
I'm glad you finally decided
to see things our way, Jedi.

138
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:30,088
But you're a fool if you think your weapons
will even scratch Zillo Beast.

139
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:35,049
These are no ordinary weapons.
Your Zillo Beast will be no match for them.

140
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,891
Maybe true. But our way is already proven.

141
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:41,331
Your way?

142
00:15:42,492 --> 00:15:44,012
Open the valve!

143
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,540
Our fuel is deadly to the beast.

144
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,740
It killed them in the past.
It will kill this one now.

145
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:26,901
You're only going to provoke it.
You'll drive it out of that hole,

146
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:31,062
- and then it'll be harder to deal with.
- We'll handle it, Jedi.

147
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:54,747
- Order them to stop!
- What? What do you mean, stop?

148
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:04,229
- I said, order them to stop!
- Or what?

149
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:10,350
We are innocent life forms, too,
are we not?

150
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,276
Charge up the rays!

151
00:17:56,842 --> 00:17:57,961
Fire.

152
00:18:08,204 --> 00:18:09,484
Back up. Back up!

153
00:18:18,607 --> 00:18:20,046
This isn't working!

154
00:18:49,174 --> 00:18:52,214
Whose bright idea was this, anyway?

155
00:18:57,455 --> 00:18:59,935
Keep the beam on him, he's getting tired.

156
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:24,420
Hey, it worked!

157
00:19:24,821 --> 00:19:27,261
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

158
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:29,461
You go first.

159
00:19:35,904 --> 00:19:39,063
Now we just have to get him out of here.

160
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:54,627
Welcome to the Republic, Doge Urus.

161
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:58,988
I am sure this business arrangement
will be mutually beneficial.

162
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:03,589
The beast has been loaded
onto the transport.

163
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,909
Have you selected a planet for relocation?

164
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:09,031
There has been a slight change of plans.

165
00:20:09,111 --> 00:20:14,151
The scientific community has reviewed
the data on this rather unique creature.

166
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:18,392
They believe it should be further studied
in a more controlled environment

167
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:20,913
before it is released into the wild.

168
00:20:21,034 --> 00:20:25,554
- And where is this controlled environment?
- On Coruscant.

169
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:31,355
Master Windu, you and General Skywalker
shall safely bring the beast here.

170
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:39,157
Well, you made the right choice.

171
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,198
We got our fuel, you saved your creature,
and now he'll be safe.

172
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:46,638
Let's hope we can say the same
about Coruscant.
