1
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,530
<i>Kidnapped!</i>

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,330
<i>During a Separatist invasion
of the planet Kiros,</i>

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,510
<i>thousands of peaceful colonists
were abducted by Zygerrian slavers.</i>

4
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,380
<i>Determined to find the missing colonists,
the Jedi travel to Zygerria,</i>

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,850
<i>home to the galaxy's
most notorious slave empire.</i>

6
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,650
It looks like Zygerria
is a popular place these days.

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,770
Hmm.

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,860
Whatever is happening
is attracting plenty of high class scum.

9
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,180
Let's just hope the information our spies
gave us about the Queen is accurate.

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,180
Remember, I'll keep her occupied

11
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,690
while you locate
the missing people of Kiros.

12
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:32,060
How do you plan
on keeping the Queen occupied?

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,860
- With my magnetic charm, of course.
- Oh, yes, of course.

14
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,700
Hold on to this, will you, buddy?

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,980
Remind me why I'm the one
playing the part of the slave?

16
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,890
I tried it once, I wasn't any good at it.

17
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,640
Besides, the role of master
comes easily to me.

18
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,310
Really? Well, this time
try to be convincing at it.

19
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,910
Ugh!

20
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,790
How can a civilization this advanced
still practice slavery?

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,210
It makes them wealthy and powerful
at the expense of others.

22
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,050
Before the Hutts bought my mother,
she was sold in a market just like this.

23
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,940
Get up, you useless skug.

24
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,780
Master, the bonds, they are too heavy.

25
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,950
Tell it to my whip.

26
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,490
You don't want to do that.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,790
You dare touch me!

28
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,790
Excuse my slave, friend.
She is freshly caught.

29
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,090
Hmm. What have we here?

30
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,090
You wear Zygerrian armor,
but you are not one of us.

31
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,300
Who are you?

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
I've come for an audience with the Queen.

33
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,180
Then you have an invitation?

34
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:34,480
We can't just let anyone in
to speak with Her Majesty.

35
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,200
No invitation, but I do bring news,
news the Queen will be eager to hear.

36
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,320
I doubt that,
you're nothing more than a brigand.

37
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,120
I wouldn't say that,
especially when the Queen learns

38
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,160
you prevented her from hearing
the news about Bruno Denturri.

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:58,000
<i>Halt! Cease all hostilities.</i>

40
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,510
<i>This man is to be escorted to the palace,
by order of the Queen.</i>

41
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,040
Make certain all preparations
are complete for this evening.

42
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,050
And fetch refreshments.

43
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,590
My Queen, I present Lars Quell.

44
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,050
Hmm.

45
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,560
So, you are the man who claims
to be acquainted with Bruno Denturri?

46
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,560
Yes, Your Highness.

47
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:00,770
However, when I spoke with him
he failed to describe your beauty.

48
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,320
Really?

49
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,780
And did Bruno
speak of my intense hatred of him?

50
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,910
Or did that escape his memory as well?

51
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,250
He needed not speak of it, Your Majesty.

52
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,750
In fact, Bruno Denturri
will not be speaking ever again.

53
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,380
What do you mean?

54
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,050
Bruno Denturri is dead by my hand.

55
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,090
Here is a slave from his palace,
compensation for my efforts.

56
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,100
Unhand me, brigand!

57
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,230
You impress me, Lars Quell.

58
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,940
She is quite a prize.

59
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,240
And to have defeated
Bruno Denturri in combat,

60
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,740
you must be quite the warrior.

61
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,380
Hmm.

62
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,790
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,460
The slave is certainly of fine stock,

64
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,130
Bruno always knew
how to choose a beautiful female.

65
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,960
Don't you dare touch me!

66
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,680
Though she will have to be processed.

67
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,260
Her demeanor leaves much to be desired.

68
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,640
What is your price for her?

69
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,310
With respect,
how can I price the beauty of this slave,

70
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,190
when I look upon
the magnificence of Your Highness,

71
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,120
whose beauty would make
the brightest star seem dull by comparison.

72
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,320
Lars Quell, you flatter me.

73
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,490
No, Your Majesty, however...

74
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,460
Lars, stop it. Stop it!

75
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,170
You are a bold one, aren't you?

76
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,380
My reputation precedes me then.

77
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:50,880
Perhaps we can find a way
to put a price on your slave.

78
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,840
Come, walk with me.

79
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:32,090
Sir, take a look at this.

80
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,720
Stand watch, I'll take a closer look.

81
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,350
Governor Roshti?

82
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,730
No! No!

83
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,400
Governor, I'm a friend,
a Jedi, here to help.

84
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,950
- Where are your people?
- They're...

85
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:12,420
- Sir, did you find out where the others are?
- Not yet.

86
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,630
We've got to get him out of here.

87
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,810
You there,
what are you doing with that slave?

88
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:03,970
Slavery is the natural order of things.

89
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,600
The weak deserve nothing more

90
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,480
than to kneel before the strong,
bound to our service.

91
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,480
I will need men with your talents
to spread our ways across the galaxy.

92
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,740
Let me go!

93
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,620
You dare raise a hand against your master.
Clearly you require further processing.

94
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,340
No! I won't go back there.

95
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,140
Wait! Stop!

96
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,010
Such a waste.

97
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,520
But perhaps she was more trouble
than she's worth.

98
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,690
But you, Lars,
you are proving quite resourceful.

99
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Very well, I will pay your price
for this slave girl.

100
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,860
It seems
I am in need of a new servant.

101
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,450
She is my gift to you, Your Highness.

102
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,040
You are a man of many surprises.
It pleases me.

103
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,630
I wish you to be my guest
at the slave auction,

104
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,710
and to sit at my side.

105
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,730
Well...

106
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,650
- Who is he?
- He hasn't talked, but I'll loosen his tongue.

107
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,410
Why would a slaver
try to rescue a slave from the palace?

108
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,240
It's suicide.

109
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,540
Wait. I know you from the hologram.

110
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:00,010
I never forget a Jedi.

111
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,810
Your Highness, Zygerrians,
and guests from a thousand worlds,

112
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,230
our auction begins

113
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:22,320
with slaves of unmatched quality
and impossible quantity.

114
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,620
I give you Togruta from the Kiros System!

115
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,120
Oh, no.

116
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,290
This handsome sample
represents a lot of numbering,

117
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,170
no less than 50,000 beings.

118
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,140
Note the compliance.

119
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,430
Virtually untrained in combat.

120
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:51,600
There will be no rebellion
from these slaves.

121
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,810
So where do you keep 50,000 slaves,
like the people of Kiros?

122
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,990
Your Majesty, I have urgent news.

123
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,990
All will be revealed in time.

124
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,880
Before we begin the auction,
I would welcome a most special guest,

125
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:24,170
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Jedi knight!

126
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,350
Down with the Jedi!
The Jedi are not so tough.

127
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:34,140
My friends, my good friends,
do not fear the Jedi.

128
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,190
They are no different from others
we have forced into submission,

129
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,570
for they have forsaken their ideals
to serve a corrupt Senate.

130
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,740
Every Jedi
has become a slave to the Republic.

131
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,910
The Jedi Order is weak,
and we will help break it.

132
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,710
Teach the Jedi his place.

133
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:23,820
Whip the Jedi! Whip the Jedi!
Whip the Jedi! Whip the Jedi!

134
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,400
Looks like
I have to rescue you again, old man.

135
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,910
I knew you'd have a backup plan.

136
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,670
Prove to me you are a slaver.
Swing that whip, or die beside him.

137
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,420
Those are some lousy options.

138
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,060
You leave me no choice, Highness.

139
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,910
Guards, subdue them!

140
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,100
Ahsoka, the Queen!

141
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,310
Looks like your slave empire
is finished, again.

142
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,940
Get that thing out of my face,
you little skug!

143
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,190
Such determination.

144
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,840
You destroyed my auction
and frightened my customers.

145
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,720
Count Dooku and half my kingdom
are demanding your death.

146
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,510
You should have listened to them.
My friends, where are they?

147
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,440
Continue to misbehave and they die.

148
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,410
A most curious Jedi who cares more
about his friends than his own mission.

149
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,420
Hero. General.

150
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,080
And now my servant.

151
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,920
I will not serve you.

152
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,920
Your heart is not in your words.

153
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:38,720
You will stand beside me,
a testament to my power.

154
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,930
Here, my bodyguard will need a weapon.

155
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:48,770
And you need not worry about your friends,
they will be quite safe.

156
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,170
The Queen has promised
once the other Jedi is tamed,

157
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,470
you will be mine, little skug.

158
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,130
Whoa!

159
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,190
You better hope that doesn't happen.

160
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,530
My people, we have found them.

161
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,860
Keep moving, skug.

162
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,870
General Kenobi, you are the first Jedi

163
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,710
I have entertained
at our educational center.

164
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:36,170
Few possess a Jedi's resolve,

165
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,880
and it is strength of will
that is my greatest enemy.

166
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,900
Now that I have your attention, Jedi,

167
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:02,700
be aware that it will not be you
who suffers should you defy me.

168
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,080
You were once a slave, weren't you?

169
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,590
What makes you think I was a slave?

170
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,600
The noble selflessness in your eyes.

171
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,640
Your commitment to the service
of something greater than yourself.

172
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,060
Your Jedi, the grand Republic,
even your friends.

173
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,980
I don't see commitment as slavery.

174
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,230
Oh, it is when it comes
at the cost of yourself.

175
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:38,440
What you could be!

176
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,450
With you willingly beside me,
there is nothing we could not accomplish.

177
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,620
We are nothing. You have all the power.

178
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,980
What if I freed your friends?

179
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,150
Would you promise to stay?
Commit to serving me?

180
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:24,650
If a Jedi as noble as you gave his word,
I think you might keep it.

181
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,500
I don't trust you.

182
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:33,000
Have I been anything but honest?
I have no reason to lie. I am who I am.

183
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
It is you, you,
who are the complicated one.

184
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:42,210
Now, Master Skywalker, the future
of your friends lays in your hands.

185
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,010
If they are to live as slaves,
it will be you who keeps them that way.
