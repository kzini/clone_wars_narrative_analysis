1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,530
<i>A people enslaved!</i>

2
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,040
<i>To locate the abducted colonists
of a peace-loving world,</i>

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,500
<i>the Jedi infiltrated the slaver planet
of Zygerria,</i>

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,380
<i>only to be captured by its ambitious queen,</i>

5
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:33,460
<i>who plots to rebuild her empire
of oppression.</i>

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>Now even Obi-Wan Kenobi
must come to terms with a life in chains.</i>

7
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:55,150
Obi-Wan Kenobi, once a Jedi master,

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,490
now a Jedi slave.

9
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,170
Pitiful.

10
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,410
Keep eyes on your toil, skug!

11
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,150
Everything about this place
is designed to shatter the will.

12
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
It has already begun to affect
these poor people.

13
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,660
Speech is forbidden!

14
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,370
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

15
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,050
There will be punishment!

16
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,500
No, stop, it's my mistake!
Leave him alone!

17
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:02,430
Now a slave gives me commands?

18
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,350
Beg!

19
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,930
Beg me before this one dies
because of you!

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,060
Please. Forgive me, Master.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,740
Keep away from me.
Jedi only make things worse.

22
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:45,260
<i>Long have Sith empires been built
upon the backs of slaves.</i>

23
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,600
<i>To carry on this tradition,
we will require millions.</i>

24
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,270
I assure you, the Queen's defiance
will not sour your plans, Master.

25
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,290
<i>If she fails to see the error of her ways,</i>

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,280
<i>end her rule.</i>

27
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,220
Have you considered my offer, Skywalker?

28
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:26,770
If you vow loyalty to me,

29
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,480
I will free your friends.

30
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,810
It's not an easy decision.

31
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,480
Hmm, curious.

32
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,690
I thought the Jedi were selfless,

33
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,730
placing the needs of others
before their own.

34
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,250
My Queen, I bring word.

35
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,620
Count Dooku is on his way here.

36
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,790
Ah, sooner than anticipated.

37
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,470
Make preparations for his arrival.

38
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,520
So even you have a master.

39
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,300
Dooku is not my master!

40
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,640
Perhaps you should not attend
this meeting.

41
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,430
Can I trust you not to run away?

42
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,270
I don't run away from anything,
Your Highness.

43
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,150
Hmm...

44
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,380
Get off, you miserable tin can!

45
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,880
Get down there and find that Jedi.

46
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,390
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,440
Nice work, pal. You find Ahsoka?

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,250
I wasn't expecting you, Count.

49
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,710
Not without an invitation.

50
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:23,630
But I was invited,
by your faithful advisor.

51
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,090
He's concerned over
how attached you've become to Skywalker.

52
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,180
Skywalker is a symbol of my...

53
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,110
Our power to enslave even Jedi.

54
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,780
Your power over him is an illusion.

55
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,310
You forget, I was once a Jedi myself.

56
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,570
You have little in common with Anakin.

57
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,070
Please, hear my plans for the Jedi,
then decide.

58
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,120
Right now,
at my facility in the Kadavo system,

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,960
Obi-Wan Kenobi is in despair.

60
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm listening.

61
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,500
Kenobi is coming to realize,

62
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,460
perhaps for the first time in his life,

63
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:10,010
that his efforts to help others
will only injure them.

64
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,020
As plans for escape
and hopes of rescue fade,

65
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,150
the gnawing fear
that he will never be able to take action

66
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,860
will grow in Kenobi's heart.

67
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,280
To ease the burden of his fellow slaves,

68
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,450
defiance will become compliance.

69
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,870
When Kenobi realizes
he cannot help those around him,

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,010
his spirit will break and he will be mine.

71
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,210
If such Jedi as Skywalker and Kenobi
can fall,

72
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,550
how many others will follow?

73
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,010
Hmm?

74
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,600
Imagine...
Imagine an army of Jedi in your service.

75
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,020
Zygerria will be invincible!

76
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,150
A most ambitious plan, Your Highness.

77
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,480
Only my goal is not the enslavement
of the Jedi Order,

78
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,820
but its extermination.

79
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,070
I have come to supervise their execution,
perform it if necessary.

80
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,090
Now,

81
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,040
summon Skywalker.

82
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,100
Well, hello, Master.

83
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,560
Took you long enough.

84
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,640
Well, I knew you had a nice view.

85
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,580
Are you okay?

86
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,620
I sense a disturbance in the Force.

87
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,120
It's Dooku. I need you to get our ship.

88
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,920
Here, take this comlink.

89
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,580
Where are you going?

90
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,590
The Queen knows where Obi-Wan is.

91
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,090
Hold on to that comlink
and wait for my signal.

92
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,130
Come on, Artoo.

93
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,930
I have no desire to end Skywalker's life.

94
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,020
He has become a valuable asset to me
and my throne.

95
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,150
Your compliance is not optional.

96
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,690
I command you to kill Skywalker.

97
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:36,450
I will not be ordered about
in my own palace, Count!

98
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,950
If you won't do my bidding,
perhaps your prime minister will.

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,510
Atai, what does he mean?

100
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,170
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
but the Count is right.

101
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,460
The Jedi should die.

102
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,840
You're not fit to be queen any longer.

103
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,800
Atai, you traitor!

104
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll make you both pay for this treachery.

105
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,400
Punishment for a slave
who disobeys her master.

106
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,940
That's enough, Dooku!

107
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,070
Skywalker.

108
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,200
I see the Queen has given you a long leash.

109
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,120
One more step and I will end her life.

110
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,140
Why would you think I care
about this slaver scum?

111
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,000
Indeed.

112
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,240
The Queen!

113
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,130
She was murdered by the Jedi.

114
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,500
That's our signal. Let's get going.

115
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,970
Take your vengeance!

116
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,370
Your Highness.

117
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,160
No escape

118
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:50,410
for any of us.

119
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,330
Where is Obi-Wan?

120
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,880
Tell me.

121
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,960
Kadavo system.

122
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,670
You were right, Skywalker.

123
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,090
I am a slave.

124
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,760
Just as you are.

125
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,630
Someone wishes to speak with you.

126
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,220
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

127
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,100
<i>In chains once again, I see.</i>

128
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,310
Count Dooku.

129
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,100
Still afraid to get your hands dirty?

130
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,730
<i>I would gladly make an exception
in your case, my friend.</i>

131
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:01,400
I wanted to say a proper farewell
before Keeper Agruss puts you to death.

132
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,260
Keeper, the slave ship <i>Tecora</i>
is making an unscheduled landing

133
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,890
on platform two-four.

134
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,680
<i>Skywalker.</i>

135
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,650
So much for our ride home.

136
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,700
What now?

137
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,370
We get through the old fashioned way.

138
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,040
<i>Kenobi, tell your young friend, Skywalker,</i>

139
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,830
<i>if he does not surrender,</i>

140
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,380
<i>the slaves will be terminated in his name.</i>

141
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,050
<i>Anakin! I'm glad to see you,</i>

142
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,600
<i>but I'm afraid our host feels otherwise.</i>

143
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,600
You can't make everyone happy, Master.

144
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,560
<i>They're threatening to kill the slaves
unless you surrender.</i>

145
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,100
It's good to see
you're always ready to negotiate.

146
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,440
But I've had enough bargaining
with slave drivers.

147
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,820
<i>Anakin, you must realize
this is a fight you cannot win alone.</i>

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,150
Who said I was alone?

149
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,380
Keeper, a fleet of warships has dropped out
of hyperspace in sector six.

150
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,210
Jedi reinforcements!

151
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,430
Wolf leader to wolf pack,
accelerate to attack speed.

152
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,220
This is Warthog, we're going in.

153
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,820
Rex! Now!

154
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,270
About time.

155
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Those towers are ray shielded.

156
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,290
I hope you told Master Plo
not to destroy this facility

157
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,000
before we get off of it.

158
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,330
Yeah, all of us and the slaves.

159
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,630
We'll need a bigger ship.

160
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,970
<i>I'm catching too much heat!</i>

161
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,880
<i>R-7, cut the engines!</i>

162
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,650
Yeah! That got 'em. Good work, General!

163
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:29,190
Keep your focus, Warthog.
Watch out for those towers!

164
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
No!

165
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,470
The walls, they're electrified.

166
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,260
The controls are destroyed, Master Plo.
There's nothing we can do from here!

167
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,350
I cannot move the cruiser in
for the rescue operation

168
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,850
until those enemy canons are destroyed.

169
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,560
<i>We'll take care of those canons.</i>

170
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,440
Just make sure
that cruiser gets down here.

171
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,280
We're running out of time!

172
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,450
I'm going to go help my people,
I'll see if I can buy us some time!

173
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,780
Good luck!

174
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,880
Incoming!

175
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,900
A Jedi!

176
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,180
You're all clear, Master Plo.

177
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,180
Bring the cruiser down to the landing pad.

178
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,850
<i>Cancel that order, Master!</i>

179
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,560
There's no way
to get the people out of the holding cell

180
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,430
and up to the landing platform.

181
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,600
But I have an idea.

182
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,650
We need to have the cruiser move in
underneath the facility.

183
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,730
We can escape onto the ship
if Admiral Coburn can get in close enough.

184
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,570
You heard Commander Tano.

185
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,960
I want the men topside with rocket packs
and cable guns. Move it!

186
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,280
Yes, sir!

187
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:43,970
Come now, Master Kenobi, I know
a Jedi won't kill an unarmed man!

188
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,200
I'm no Jedi.

189
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,270
Okay, everyone, get ready.
We'll have to go by groups!

190
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Gotcha.

191
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,600
<i>That's everyone. We have to go.
The facility's breaking up!</i>

192
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,690
Okay, Master Plo, the cruiser is clear!

193
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,650
All gunships, fire!

194
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:54,140
I thank you, the Jedi, and the Republic
for saving our lives.

195
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,020
Ahsoka is the real hero.

196
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,980
Without her creativity, I don't think
we would've gotten your people to safety.

197
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,740
Indeed. Padawan Tano,
might I have a word in private?

198
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,530
Of course.

199
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:16,210
Ahsoka, you have done a great deed
for your people today.

200
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,920
You're sad?

201
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,170
Well, you and the Jedi have done your best,

202
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:26,470
but I do not think our people will recover
from this horror anytime soon.

203
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,180
I understand, but in the end,

204
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,220
surviving this
will only strengthen the people.

205
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:38,070
Perhaps, and perhaps the people of Kiros
will also join the Republic.

206
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,020
I think that's a wise choice, Governor.
