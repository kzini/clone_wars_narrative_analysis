1
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,600
<i>Ahsoka Tano on the run!</i>

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,630
<i>After an attack on the Jedi Temple,</i>

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:25,830
<i>Anakin Skywalker's young Padawan
found herself accused</i>

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,200
<i>of murdering the person
responsible for the bombings.</i>

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:32,510
<i>With no choice but to run,
she was chased by her master,</i>

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,310
<i>who begged her to turn herself in.</i>

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,790
<i>Knowing there is little hope
of being cleared of the crimes,</i>

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,820
<i>Ahsoka decided to find out the truth</i>

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,750
<i>and prove her innocence on her own.</i>

10
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,990
<i>After further investigation,
there can be little doubt</i>

11
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,260
<i>that the clone officers
murdered in the escape</i>

12
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,430
<i>were killed by none other
than Ahsoka Tano herself.</i>

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,790
<i>She used a Jedi mind trick</i>

14
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,960
<i>to convince the clone to open the door</i>

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,630
<i>and then proceeded to cut him down</i>

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,130
<i>along with five other clones
along the way.</i>

17
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,700
I do not believe that Ahsoka
could have fallen so far.

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,710
<i>The beliefs of
the Jedi Council are irrelevant.</i>

19
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,440
<i>We deal strictly in facts and evidence,</i>

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,080
<i>and the evidence points
to Padawan Tano being guilty</i>

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,580
<i>of the attack on the temple</i>

22
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,510
<i>and the murder of the Republic officers.</i>

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,610
<i>This is sedition.</i>

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,580
Skywalker, was there no way
to stop your Padawan

25
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,620
before she escaped?

26
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,520
No, Master Mundi.

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,760
The Council believes that Ahsoka

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,820
may be guilty of the crime,

29
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,230
still believe they are wrong,
do you, hmm?

30
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,900
I believe she didn't kill
the clone troopers

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,530
or the woman
who used the nano-droids

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,900
to blow up the temple.

33
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,470
That's why she's running.

34
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,170
To prove her innocence.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,080
Now she's in the lower depths.

36
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,500
With her skills,
she will be hard to find.

37
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:57,770
Two teams we will send.

38
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,670
Master Skywalker and Master Plo Koon,

39
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,840
with clones you will go.

40
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:06,810
I think it would be best
if Skywalker stayed here.

41
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,350
Having you involved
may actually make things worse.

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,220
Master Windu, with all due respect,

43
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,390
she is <i>my</i> Padawan.

44
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,330
The reason for you not to go.

45
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,470
I think we're being foolish

46
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,100
if we take Anakin off this mission.

47
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,410
Who knows her better?

48
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,010
He's emotionally tied to her.

49
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,400
Probably too emotional
to do what needs to be done.

50
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,600
I'd rather capture Ahsoka
and find out the truth

51
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,910
then let her run because of a lie.

52
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,440
You must prove to us
that you will stay focused.

53
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,780
Can you?

54
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:40,420
I've already alerted security
on the lower levels

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,080
to be on the lookout for Ahsoka.

56
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,390
Go swiftly then, Skywalker,
and bring back this lost child

57
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,920
before it is too late.

58
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,860
Yes, Master.

59
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,390
This one just came in.

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,660
Looks like the Jedi
are after one of their own.

61
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,770
She's armed and dangerous.

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,770
Alert all units.

63
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,510
You heard him.

64
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,060
Barriss, it's Ahsoka.

65
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,520
Ahsoka, I'm so glad you're safe.

66
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,860
- Safe but on the run.
- Where?

67
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,070
I can't tell you,

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,660
but someone is definitely trying
to frame me.

69
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,036
It's not safe for you to call me

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,800
using the Jedi communicator.

71
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,710
Find another way to contact me.

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,970
I will.

73
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,546
In the meantime, I'll do some digging

74
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,000
and see if I can find anything out

75
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,600
to help you on my end.

76
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,647
Thank you, Barriss.

77
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:22,510
Be safe.

78
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,790
Hey, buddy, are you hungry?

79
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,490
Yeah.

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
Let's make a trade.

81
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,100
What do you want?

82
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,670
Your cloak.

83
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,970
Passes, please.

84
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
Passes, please.

85
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,210
Passes, please.

86
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,570
That's her. The rogue Jedi.

87
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
All units respond.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,400
We have located the rogue Jedi.

89
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,430
- Uh.
- Whoa.

90
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,240
- Ah!
- Oh.

91
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,440
Get out of the way. Look out!

92
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,980
Stop her!

93
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,910
I've got her.

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
Ah!

95
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,050
Ugh.

96
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,096
- Look out.
- Ah.

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,430
- Whoa.
- Ah!

98
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,930
<i>Dupa-la zuga lu!</i>

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Sir, look!

100
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,700
Stop!

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,470
Not good.

102
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,780
Don't worry, little guy,
I'll get us out of this.

103
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,520
I'll... I'll think of something.

104
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,130
Maybe I can cut a hole in the roof.

105
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,550
<i>Ya kumay na. Ya kumay na.</i>

106
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,790
Almost there. <i>Kumay na.</i>

107
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,820
Almost got it. <i>Kumay na.</i>

108
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,890
<i>Kumay na.</i>

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,360
<i>Kumay na.</i>

110
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,960
Huh.

111
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,630
I, uh, guess I'm not exactly
on my game these days.

112
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,540
Thanks, kid. I owe you one.

113
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,736
The lower level police claim
to have spotted Commander Tano

114
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,890
heading to level 1312.

115
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,190
All right, let's bring her home.

116
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
Uh!

117
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:48,730
Well, well, I didn't believe it

118
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,270
when I first heard it,

119
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,200
but I guess it's true,

120
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:56,010
the Senate has put a bounty
on your horned little head.

121
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,500
And I'm going to be the one
who collects.

122
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,170
Ventress, it was you, wasn't it?

123
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,880
You were behind all of this,
and you framed me!

124
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

125
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,520
Yes, you do!

126
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,320
So what are you now, a bounty hunter?

127
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,360
Yes, and someone who knows
how to make easy money.

128
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,760
You think
you're just gonna hand me over?

129
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,700
And then what?
Get a pat on the shoulder?

130
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,930
You're Separatist war criminal
and a Sith.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,770
They'll have us both in prison
before you said your name.

132
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,370
I don't have to hand you
over to the Jedi.

133
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,000
I can hand you over to the bondsman

134
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,710
and still get paid.

135
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,640
I'm gonna get my money
whether you're dead or alive.

136
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,410
Heh, good luck.

137
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:56,310
Despite what you hear, I'm still a Jedi.

138
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,820
I'm afraid the other Jedi
no longer see it that way.

139
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,390
I hate to admit it, but you're right.

140
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,550
That's why I'm going to need your help.

141
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,130
In what star system do you
think I would ever help you?

142
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,890
A traitorous Jedi tried
to blow up the Jedi Temple

143
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,600
and has framed me for that
and other killings.

144
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,740
Mmm, so the Jedi
aren't that holy after all.

145
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I know Dooku tried to have you killed.

146
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,210
I know he betrayed you.

147
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,490
What if this is his new apprentice?

148
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,840
I've fallen from my path

149
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,850
just as you've fallen from yours.

150
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,280
We have a lot more in common
than you think.

151
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,790
What can you offer me
that's better than money?

152
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,620
If you help me,
I'll speak to the Council

153
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,790
and the Senate on your behalf.

154
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,560
I'll get you a full pardon
for your crimes.

155
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,730
You have my attention.

156
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,900
But I'm going to go
where the tide flows.

157
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:55,930
If the tide is flowing against you,

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,210
don't think I'll forget about
the bounty on your head.

159
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,570
Fair enough.

160
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,340
I suggest we find
somewhere else to discuss this.

161
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,910
Shine the light over there.

162
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,680
Stay where you are!

163
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Ventress.

164
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,910
Send out the probes.

165
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,540
I want them found now!

166
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:51,620
Nice place you have here.

167
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,250
Not everyone on Coruscant

168
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,890
lives in a luxurious temple
on the surface.

169
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,030
I guess I'll have to get used to that.

170
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,060
Just make the call.

171
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,940
Adding another criminal act
to your record?

172
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,640
I don't want them
to be able to trace it.

173
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,370
Barriss, it's me.

174
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,110
It's so good to see you, Ahsoka.

175
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,180
Are you okay?

176
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,610
Yeah, I'm okay,

177
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,950
if you consider Anakin
and a hundred clones on my tail

178
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,420
a good space to be in.

179
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,950
You were almost captured?

180
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,820
Once or twice, yeah.

181
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,950
Where are you?

182
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,890
I can't say, Barriss.

183
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,690
I believe I've found a clue.

184
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,060
A clue?

185
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,830
How? From where?

186
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,400
We don't have much time, Ahsoka.

187
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:45,430
Fine, I'm on level 1312.

188
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,640
A holo-booth
at the corner of 12th and G.

189
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,140
Got it.

190
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:56,140
Three levels up there seems
to be an abandoned warehouse

191
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,580
where they used to build munitions

192
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,856
that Letta visited during
the time she was getting access

193
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
to the nano-droids.

194
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,950
How did you find this out?

195
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,980
I told you I would do some checking.

196
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,990
Ah, thank you, Barriss.

197
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,390
Be careful, Ahsoka.

198
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,390
Well?

199
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,060
I think I have a lead.

200
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,500
It doesn't seem like you need my help.

201
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,770
That's not true.

202
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,870
We need to find
an abandoned munitions warehouse

203
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,480
on level 1315.

204
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,220
We should be able to find
some information there.

205
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:40,850
You know the place
I'm talking about, don't you?

206
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,090
Yes.

207
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,800
I can get you there.

208
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,860
Listen to me.

209
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,200
I don't want to fight.

210
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,000
I do.

211
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,970
We're taking you in now, Commander.

212
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
That's not gonna happen, trust me.

213
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,910
Now I'm not going to hurt
any of you...

214
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,340
we're not going to hurt
any of you...

215
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,880
but you're not taking me in.

216
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,460
Commander, we are taking you in.

217
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,667
Let's play.

218
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:18,850
Take 'em out. Ah!

219
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,960
Take her out. Take her out.

220
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,350
Ventress, don't.

221
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,490
Look out! Ugh!

222
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,760
They'll cut us down!

223
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,960
Oh!

224
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,030
Watch it!

225
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,030
Take a shot.

226
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,670
Too fast.

227
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,210
Arg.

228
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,540
Ah, oh.

229
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,410
See?

230
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,720
Didn't kill one.

231
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,820
It's the new me.

232
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,260
General Plo Koon, we had Commander Tano,

233
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:11,600
but she escaped
with the help of Asajj Ventress.

234
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,580
There it is.

235
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,490
That's where you're supposed
to find this clue.

236
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,730
I've done my part of the bargain,

237
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,230
which means you're on your own
from here.

238
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,700
But don't forget,

239
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,300
you have to speak on my behalf now.

240
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,740
That was the deal.

241
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,140
Agreed.

242
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,840
Thanks for getting this far, at least.

243
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,680
I have to admit,

244
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,580
I never saw us
doing anything together. Ever.

245
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:57,950
These are strange times.

246
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,810
I thought we decided
we were going to part ways.

247
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,390
Ugh, ah!

248
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,570
Ah!

249
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,920
How am I supposed to find a clue

250
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:24,020
when I don't even know
what I'm looking for?

251
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,230
Uh!

252
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,370
Ventress!

253
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,470
I see you've had a change of heart.

254
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,420
Why bring me here?

255
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,860
Answer me, Ventress.

256
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,920
Why?

257
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Ah!

258
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,730
Calling all units.

259
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,770
Suspicious activity on level 1315.

260
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,620
Ugh.

261
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,320
Nano-droids?

262
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,460
No, Wolffe, let me explain.

263
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,470
Explosives.

264
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,380
These are the same types
of nano-droids

265
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,340
that were used to blow up
the Jedi Temple.

266
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:38,210
I can't believe it.

267
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,100
<i>Captured she has been?</i>

268
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,060
Yes, Master Yoda.

269
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,670
<i>Without incident?</i>

270
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,360
No, she was subdued by the clones

271
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,600
and found in possession
of explosive nano-droids.

272
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:01,600
It still doesn't explain
Ventress's involvement.

273
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,870
We saw her with Ahsoka.

274
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,270
<i>I think there's more going on
than we know.</i>

275
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,510
By Ahsoka or against her?

276
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,780
<i>That remains to be seen.</i>

277
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,510
<i>We're bringing her back to the temple.</i>

278
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,350
<i>Let's just hope we can keep her here.</i>
