1
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,380
<i>Dooku held for ransom!</i>

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,580
<i>After escaping capture
by Jedi knights Anakin Skywalker</i>

3
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,420
<i>and Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

4
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,380
<i>the villainous Count Dooku
fell into the clutches of pirates</i>

5
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:28,620
<i>led by the brigand Hondo Ohnaka.</i>

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,600
<i>Eager to get custody of Dooku,</i>

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,980
<i>the Republic agreed
to pay Hondo a hefty sum</i>

8
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:35,020
<i>in exchange for the Sith lord.</i>

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,940
<i>But Anakin and Obi-Wan
had not counted</i>

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,060
<i>on the treacherous cunning
of Ohnaka and his band.</i>

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,460
Master.

12
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,500
What happened?

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,860
Well, I guess that pirate brew
is stronger than we thought.

14
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,420
I only took a sip.

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,580
We were drugged, obviously.

16
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,780
Why would they risk
losing the ransom?

17
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,980
The deal appears to have changed.

18
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,060
They must be trying to
triple their payday.

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,420
A shrewd observation, Master Kenobi.

20
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,380
Great. It's you.

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,740
I did warn you
these pirates were devious.

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,620
You will notice our shackles
are bound together.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,860
I have tried to separate us

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,860
to no avail.

25
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,420
It's bad enough
we have to be in the same cell,

26
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,540
but could you at least spare me
the sound of your constant chatter?

27
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,980
And while I hold my tongue,

28
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,980
the two of you will devise
a brilliant strategy

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
for getting off
this godforsaken planet?

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,460
- Yes!
- Yes!

31
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,780
Excellent.

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,740
I told you
kidnapping the Sith lord

33
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,860
was a stroke of brilliance.

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,180
I can almost smell that spice now.

35
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,780
It'll be worth twice as much to us
on the black market.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,620
But I think we could've gotten
a bigger ransom from the Separatists.

37
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,340
You fool.

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,180
Sometimes I wonder
why I bother to keep you around.

39
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,780
If we tried to ransom Count Dooku off
to the Separatists,

40
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,980
they would simply send
their droid armies here

41
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,540
to wipe us out.

42
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,140
Now, as my sweet mother always said,

43
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,060
"Son, if one hostage is good,

44
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,700
"two are better.

45
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,660
"And three?
Well, that's just good business."

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,780
How much do you think they'll fetch?

47
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,980
Don't you worry about how much.
You'll get your cut.

48
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,660
Just see to it
that the Republic's ransom gets here.

49
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
Once we get the ransom for the Sith,

50
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,340
then we'll get the ransom
for the Jedi.

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,660
Thank you, mom.

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,220
The spice is on its way.

53
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,740
Hondo has asked me to go out
and meet the Republic senators

54
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,660
and bring them here with the ransom.

55
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,940
But I want you to intercept that ship
and force it down.

56
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,540
Be careful.

57
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,900
I want that spice intact.

58
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,900
It's too risky.
What about Hondo?

59
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,260
Yeah, that nitwit couldn't kill a nuna.
He depends on me for that.

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,740
I'll tell him the ship was destroyed
with everyone on it,

61
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,220
including the spice.

62
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,460
By the time he finds out the truth,
we'll be long gone.

63
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:13,180
<i>- ...and we'll be landing...
- Hidey-ho, Chancellor.</i>

64
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,620
- <i>Me-sa have a question.</i>
- In a moment, Representative Binks.

65
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,700
Good work, Senator Kharrus.

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,380
I am relieved you're about to arrive
at the pirates' stronghold safely.

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,900
Captain Hondo,
the leader of those brigands,

68
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,580
will accept the ransom

69
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,260
and turn Count Dooku
over to the Jedi.

70
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,460
And then
they will bring him back with you.

71
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,020
Once we've landed,
our signal will be strong enough

72
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,460
to set up proper communications.

73
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,980
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

74
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,980
Senator Kharrus, Representative Binks,
take your seats.

75
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,060
We are coming in for a landing.

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,540
The last time I went
on one of these ransom missions,

77
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,100
I spent three weeks in a dungeon.

78
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,420
Representative Binks,
stop fooling around.

79
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,740
We're landing.
Secure yourself.

80
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,260
Me-sa trying.

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,140
Is-sa stucken.

82
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,500
- We're under attack.
- We've been betrayed.

83
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,300
Missile closing.
Bank left!

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,020
What the...?

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,780
- Jar Jar, what are you doing?
- Sorry. Me-sa fix it.

86
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,420
- Mack, what's going on back there?
- Sir, you must get out of the cockpit.

87
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,180
- We're hit!
- Sir, you must leave.

88
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,780
Get back into your seat.

89
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,980
We're going down.

90
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,380
Don't you think our priority
should be escape first, eat second?

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,180
Do control your protégé's insolence
so I can concentrate.

92
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,580
- Anakin.
- What?

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,020
Control your insolence.
The Count is concentrating.

94
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,020
Well done, if I do say so myself.

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,820
Most impressive.

96
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,820
Me-sa no see-a Senator Kharrus.

97
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,260
Pilots are dead.

98
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:15,500
Sir, over here.
I found the senator.

99
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,180
He can't be dead.

100
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,620
We've got to figure out
a way to contact Coruscant.

101
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,140
They crashed into Doshar field.

102
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,940
Good, good.
And you have the spice?

103
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,940
No, not exactly. No.

104
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,900
I think there are survivors.

105
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,340
We have to call it off.
Maybe we should tell Hondo.

106
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,780
No one tells Hondo anything!

107
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,780
If anyone survived that crash,
we'll take care of 'em.

108
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,260
Trust me,

109
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,700
we're getting that spice.

110
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,660
We do know where we're going,
don't we?

111
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,860
Hush, Anakin.

112
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,940
Do we know where we're going?

113
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,020
Quiet.

114
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,580
I was brought this way
when I was captured. It was open then.

115
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,780
I found the door key.

116
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,820
This is the way to the hangar.

117
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,660
Yes, but are you sure it's safe?

118
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,860
- The key works.
- Is it safe?

119
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,620
Of course it is.

120
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,580
Right.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,740
Hold it right there, Jedi.

122
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,750
What were we thinking,
following a Sith lord?

123
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,790
Oh, what to do,
what to do, what to do?

124
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,150
I don't want to kill you, per se.

125
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,550
In fact,
you seem like decent fellows.

126
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,630
Even you, Count.
This is just business,

127
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:01,310
and once I get my money,
we can go back to being friends.

128
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,550
It's very simple.

129
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,230
Now, try not to complicate things
by breaking out again.

130
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,030
We have to get out of here before
the Republic arrives with the ransom.

131
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,230
For once, I agree with you.

132
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,150
- Any luck repairing the homing beacon?
- No, sir.

133
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,950
You-sa find rest, Senator.

134
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,950
Thosen with good in their heart

135
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,910
always passen too soon.

136
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,190
Sir, with the death of Senator Kharrus,
are you now in command of the mission?

137
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,870
Technically, no.

138
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,070
Then, who is?

139
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,670
Representative Binks
is the highest-ranking person here.

140
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,830
- We be missing you, Senator.
- Sir, this place is dangerous.

141
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,470
Look, those geysers
are spitting out acid.

142
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,750
These-a beasties
don't like the geysers neither.

143
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,910
What is it, Sergeant?

144
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:11,710
How are we gonna deliver the ransom
to the Jedi and get Count Dooku back?

145
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,310
You do not want to stand guard.

146
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,670
I do not want to stand guard.

147
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,350
You want to deactivate the cell bars

148
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,870
and go out drinking.

149
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,110
I want to deactivate the cell bars

150
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,510
and go out drinking.

151
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,630
Not bad.

152
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:39,190
Yes, most impressive, Master Kenobi.

153
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,630
What's-a that?

154
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,070
You think this is trouble, sir?

155
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,950
They could be the ones
we're supposed to deliver the ransom to.

156
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,630
Or they-sa the ones
that be shooting us down.

157
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:02,550
You're right, Binks. Incoming!
Form a circle!

158
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,110
There's not enough cover out here.

159
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,790
They're cutting us off
from the shuttle.

160
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,350
We've got to regroup.

161
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,830
Follow me. Let's hide.

162
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,710
Come on, men.

163
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,910
Where'd they go?

164
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,310
I don't know.
Maybe they fell in a crater.

165
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,190
Find the spice.

166
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,430
Should we look for the clones
in the crater?

167
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,750
Get back here.

168
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,990
Once that geyser goes off,
they're broiled.

169
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,390
- We're not gonna last long in here.
- Don't worry.

170
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,030
As long as those beasties
are up there, we're safe.

171
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,830
When they run, we run.

172
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,670
See? Me-sa knew it was safe,
since the beasties are nearby.

173
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,710
Come on, let's go!

174
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,750
Commander, you're right.
The ransom's gone.

175
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,510
I suggest we stay here
and wait for the Republic

176
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,870
- to send a rescue party.
- We-sa can't wait.

177
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,030
We don't have much choice.

178
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,990
Ani and Obi are waiting for us
to deliver the spicen.

179
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,030
Those pirates are on speeders.
How are we gonna catch them?

180
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,350
Me-sa be having an idea.

181
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,230
Hurry it up, Dooku.

182
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,070
You should be more patient, Master.

183
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,750
After all, the Count
is an elderly gentleman

184
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,990
- and doesn't move like he used to.
- I suppose you're right.

185
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,390
I would kill you both right now

186
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,110
if I did not have to
drag your bodies.

187
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,190
Look! There they are.

188
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,750
Giddy up!

189
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,790
Let him go, sir.
We've got the spice back.

190
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,510
Now we just have to
get beyond that wall.

191
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,030
Let's go!

192
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,670
This is not going well.

193
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,550
Don't let them get away!

194
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,350
Hey, what are you guys doing?

195
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:40,430
You're too heavy.
I can't do it.

196
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,070
Drop Dooku!

197
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,630
I guess this means
we won't be friends.

198
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,850
Right, now that we have the spice,
we need to find the compound.

199
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,010
- Anything to the south?
- Nothing, sir.

200
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,130
Who knows where
that pirate stronghold is from here.

201
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,890
Well, look at that.

202
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,650
Power lines.

203
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,950
They must lead somewhere.

204
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,650
There's-a power,
there's-a be people too.

205
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,250
Captain!

206
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,570
Well, Turk,

207
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,890
did the Republic arrive
with my spice?

208
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,530
The Republic deceived us.

209
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:26,370
They didn't send the ransom,
they sent an army.

210
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,170
They ambushed us in Doshar field.

211
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,290
I suggest we counterattack
with tanks.

212
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,810
- Where are your men?
- I was the only survivor.

213
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,530
I think they will attack us
to try and free the Jedi.

214
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,650
I warned them.

215
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,930
I didn't want
to torture anyone.

216
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,610
But now?
Even in a galaxy at war...

217
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,450
you hope to find some honor.

218
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,330
Let me take our tanks.
I'll make 'em pay.

219
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,850
Go. Stop them before they reach
the compound.

220
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,250
I will deal with the Jedi.

221
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,930
Yes, Captain.

222
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,890
We have to find a way out of here

223
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,810
before Senator Kharrus
and Jar Jar arrive.

224
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:07,450
We'll look like fools.

225
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,490
I think it's time
to lose the dead weight.

226
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,130
You two, come with us.

227
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:26,610
There be some bombad clankens
coming this-a way.

228
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,290
What?
Bombad clankens?

229
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,970
Right there!

230
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,370
- Where?
- There!

231
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,490
- Wait!
- Over there! Come on! There!

232
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,290
You're right.
Bombad clankers.

233
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,170
Representative Binks,
we're going to need your services

234
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:49,130
- for this part of the mission.
- Who-sa? Me-sa?

235
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,090
Yes, sir.
You are the Senate representative.

236
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:55,810
We need you to go out there
and negotiate with the pirates.

237
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,930
Me-sa no liken this idea,

238
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,970
but I think is-sa
what Senator Kharrus woulda do-sa.

239
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,090
He's probably going
to get himself killed.

240
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,650
Don't worry.
He's smarter than he looks.

241
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,890
I take it the Republic didn't arrive
with the ransom.

242
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:26,090
Your Republic obviously doesn't want

243
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,730
the Sith lord.

244
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,210
They didn't show?

245
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,170
They did.
They did show...

246
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,050
...with a huge army
that they thought would be enough

247
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,130
to get the better of me,

248
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,570
- Hondo!
- That can't be right.

249
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,410
Are you calling me a liar?

250
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,050
Isn't that kind of what you do
for a living?

251
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,970
You reject my hospitality,

252
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,890
refuse to wait in your cell,

253
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,650
and now
you're going to insult me?

254
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,850
- I'm just saying.
- Anakin.

255
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,610
What? He is a pirate.

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,490
Yes, but this may not be the best time
for you to speak.

257
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,690
- But you--
- At all, Anakin!

258
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,770
What are you supposed to be?

259
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,650
Me-sa Representative Binks.

260
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,770
Me-sa coming to deliver the spicen.

261
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,170
Where's the army Turk reported?

262
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,610
Don't know.

263
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,010
Let's fry this one
and look around.

264
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,770
No, if he's a representative,

265
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,610
he might be worth something as well.

266
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,930
You, Representative Bink,

267
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,970
we'll take you to your Jedi friends

268
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,330
so you can... negotiate.

269
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,130
Okey-day.

270
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,330
Sir, they're taking

271
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,930
- Representative Binks hostage.
- Get ready.

272
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,370
Sorry. Sorry!

273
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:10,930
What happened to the power?
I was having fun.

274
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:22,890
What the...?

275
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,130
Hold it right there.

276
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,290
Kill him. Kill him!

277
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,090
He's no representative.
He's a plague!

278
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,490
Who's-a plague-a? Me-sa?

279
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,810
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Nice work, sir!

280
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,410
We're leaving without the spice?

281
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,330
It won't be long until Hondo
figures out what's happened.

282
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,890
What are you doing?

283
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,970
What chance
do you really have, Jedi?

284
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,930
Now let me go,

285
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,210
and I might let you live.

286
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:28,610
Approach us, and he dies.

287
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,890
Looks like your forces
were destroyed, Jedi.

288
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,290
Ani! Obi!

289
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:39,091
Jar Jar?

290
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,290
Me-sa have arrived with the spicen.

291
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:45,490
Excellent, Jar Jar, assuming
the pirates still have Count Dooku to trade.

292
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:55,010
Well, that answers that question.

293
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,130
Commander,
start the engines, please.

294
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,890
So what now, Jedi?

295
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,930
You're going to arrest me?

296
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,290
- No. Anakin, release him.
- What?

297
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,650
Captain, you have nothing we want,

298
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:15,770
and since we're not prisoners anymore,
you have no bargaining power.

299
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,130
What?
You-sa was in bombad trouble?

300
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:19,890
Me-sa rescued you.

301
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,850
No, Jar Jar.
We weren't in any trouble.

302
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,410
Let's leave on even terms.

303
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,210
Hold. Hold!

304
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,610
Jedi,

305
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,250
after everything,

306
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,850
you're just going to walk away?

307
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,210
We have no quarrel with you,
and we seek no revenge.

308
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:42,650
Indeed very honorable,
Master Jedi.

309
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,170
Oh, Captain,

310
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:47,730
you will find that Count Dooku
does not share our sense of honor,

311
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,890
and he knows where you live.
