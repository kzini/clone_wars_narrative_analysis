1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,490
<i>Fugitives on the run!</i>

2
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,250
<i>Disguised as Jedi killer, Rako Hardeen,</i>

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:25,250
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi works undercover</i>

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,460
<i>to solve a Separatist plot
against Chancellor Palpatine.</i>

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,340
<i>Obi-Wan meets the plot's mastermind,
Moralo Eval,</i>

6
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,130
<i>breaking him out of jail to gain his trust.</i>

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,050
<i>But now, Kenobi faces another obstacle,</i>

8
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,220
<i>bounty hunter, Cad Bane.</i>

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,890
<i>Can Obi-Wan Kenobi
overcome Bane's suspicions?</i>

10
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,810
<i>Or will the ruthless criminal
see through his disguise</i>

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,350
<i>and expose the Jedi?</i>

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,270
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,230
We're coming in too fast, Hardeen.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,490
Are you trying to kill us?

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,160
They'll be waiting for us
at every space port.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,660
We have to ditch the ship.

17
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,700
You mean you're going
to intentionally crash us into the swamp?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,920
Yeah, that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
He's right. We have no choice.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,800
Get ready for a fast exit.

21
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,760
Nobody can trace us here.
The swamp will swallow up the ship.

22
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,300
So we leave no trace of our crash.

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,970
Moralo Eval likes a man who plans ahead.

24
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:12,160
You do have a plan?

25
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,320
Yeah, I know Nal Hutta.

26
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,030
We can get a new ship
at the Bilbousa Bazaar,

27
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,070
but this time, we buy one.

28
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,910
Otherwise, we'll have the authorities
back on our tail.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,660
Not so fast.

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,540
We need to ditch these prison fatigues.

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,250
We'll have a bounty on our heads
for escaping

32
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,040
and I don't like to stand out.

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,650
That's local security.

34
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,520
Keep moving.

35
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,330
We'll get some new gear and equipment.

36
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,800
Pablo's pawn shop

37
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,290
has everything a bounty hunter needs
and more.

38
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,060
Now all I need's a new hat.

39
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,690
For trying to blend in,

40
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,190
your hat sure makes you stand out.

41
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,610
I don't like to hide under a helmet.

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,780
Is there anything else you desire?
A new ship?

43
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,000
Your choice of weapons is lousy, Pablo.

44
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,540
Where can I get some quality blasters?

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,210
I wouldn't be too picky being on the run,
like you obviously are.

46
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,760
I'd keep my mouth shut if I were you,
Pablo.

47
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,220
We'll get our weapons elsewhere.

48
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,060
Thanks for the hat.

49
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,640
For your trouble.

50
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,910
That trader's heard worse threats
than yours, Bane.

51
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:25,700
Probably calling the Hutts right now,

52
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,420
seeing what kind of bounty there is on us.

53
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,910
Relax.

54
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,370
On this slime-pool, everybody's an outlaw.

55
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,420
Besides,
they'll be looking for three of us.

56
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,590
So we're splitting up.

57
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,550
You find a ship, we'll get weapons.

58
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,550
Not so fast.

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,140
If it's all the same to you,
I'll get the weapons.

60
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,390
It's not the same to me.

61
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,690
You crashed the ship,
you get us a new one.

62
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,820
It does seem fair.

63
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,660
Soon as we have a ship, we ditch Hardeen.

64
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,590
Really?

65
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,250
We'll throw him to the Hutts.

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,250
While they interrogate him,
we'll be long gone.

67
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:22,340
Tell me, is this business or personal?

68
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,760
Both.

69
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,770
No, no, no. That's my final offer.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,620
All right then, it's a deal.

71
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,870
Good timing.

72
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,250
Soon as you pay for the ship,
we can get moving.

73
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,120
With pleasure.

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,920
Hey, where's my weapon?

75
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,960
Won't need it. You're not coming.

76
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,520
Says who?

77
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,010
He doesn't want to split his fee
for breaking me out of prison.

78
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,140
And also, he despises you.

79
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,730
All I know is I'm not going anywhere
without my reward.

80
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm sorry. This is between you two.

81
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
What's it gonna be, Bane?

82
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,830
Here's your reward,

83
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,330
I'm not killing you.

84
00:06:58,850 --> 00:06:59,930
Where am I?

85
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,900
You're a guest of the Hutts.

86
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,980
If you do not answer my questions
about your two partners,

87
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,150
we will not be so hospitable.

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
You call this hospitable?

89
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,080
Wait. Torture won't be necessary.

90
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,830
My partners double-crossed me,

91
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,790
but I put a tracking device on their ship.

92
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,010
Let me down and I'll
tell you the frequency.

93
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,390
Now tell us the tracking frequency.

94
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,870
Yes, Count Dooku. I'm sorry I was delayed.

95
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,190
I'm free now.

96
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,040
I'll try to reach Serenno
as soon as possible.

97
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,740
<i>No more excuses, Eval.</i>

98
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,160
<i>Time is running short.</i>

99
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,450
Yes, Count Dooku, no more excuses.

100
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,340
You said it yourself, Eval.

101
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,880
You're free now. I want my money.

102
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,420
After the weapons and the ship,
I have very few credits left.

103
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,260
You'll be paid when we reach Serenno.

104
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,850
What is this? Who is attacking us?

105
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,640
The Hutts!

106
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,560
How did they find us so quickly?

107
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,780
Hardeen, trying to even the score.

108
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,950
The engines are fried,
we'll have to turn back.

109
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:45,120
<i>Their ship will crash soon on Nal Hutta.</i>

110
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,630
<i>Be there to capture the fugitives.</i>

111
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,300
You found the ship like I said.

112
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,340
Our deal was you'd let me go now.

113
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,470
The deal has changed.

114
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,350
This is Ben.

115
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,310
I apologize
for being out of communication,

116
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:50,150
but the situation was rather tenuous.

117
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,400
Although, it now appears
things may be on track soon.

118
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,730
<i>Here's what I need,</i>

119
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,490
<i>have the bounty on us removed.</i>

120
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,400
<i>If I can win over Cad Bane,</i>

121
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:01,570
<i>I can learn more about Eval's plot.</i>

122
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:04,370
<i>But there can be no more complications.</i>

123
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,950
<i>So no matter what reports you hear,</i>

124
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,080
<i>do not contact me or send help.</i>

125
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,290
<i>And one more thing,</i>

126
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,550
<i>I shall need enough credits
to buy a new ship.</i>

127
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,100
Why are you removing the bounty
on the three fugitives?

128
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,430
<i>If they're free to move, they could
lead us back to Eval's operation.</i>

129
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,390
Very well. Keep me apprised.

130
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,810
You look troubled, Anakin.

131
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,070
How can they expect me to just sit here
and do nothing

132
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,490
with Obi-Wan's murderer on the loose?

133
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:45,080
It is possible that they do not trust you
to control your feelings.

134
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,120
Hardeen killed my master, my best friend!

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,880
And now he's escaping with Cad Bane
and Moralo Eval,

136
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,420
and the Jedi Council won't do anything
about it!

137
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,090
I have it from a reliable source
that the fugitives were last headed

138
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,510
towards Nal Hutta.

139
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,310
You cannot deny your feelings, Anakin.

140
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,930
They are what make you special.

141
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,150
If you believe you can stop this plot
against me,

142
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,860
I trust you.

143
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,400
Thank you, Chancellor.
You won't regret this.

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,740
No. I won't.

145
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,290
Oh, back so soon?

146
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,380
Let me guess? You missed me?

147
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,890
Watch it!

148
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,350
Kill me and you won't get off Nal Hutta.

149
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,890
Moralo Eval is running out of time
and patience.

150
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,310
Let the man talk.

151
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,740
Look, I've got a ship.

152
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,320
You've got the Hutts on your tail,
so you make me a partner in everything.

153
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,950
Your deal is accepted.

154
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,160
No.

155
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:16,830
First I wanna know
where you got the credits to buy a ship?

156
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,510
You thought you left me for dead,

157
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,340
but the Hutts owed me a favor.

158
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,170
So you had them shoot us down?

159
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,510
You would've done the same thing, Bane.

160
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,980
The way I see it, we're even now.

161
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,510
Now that we're all friends,

162
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,020
get me off this festering stink-hole.

163
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,400
Wait, who's going to pay for this mess?

164
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,030
So about your fee from Eval,
a 50/50 split sounds fair to me.

165
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,870
Over my dead corpse.

166
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,460
Don't tempt me.

167
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,930
What makes you think Obi-Wan's murderer
is on Nal Hutta?

168
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,720
I got a tip from the Chancellor himself.

169
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,020
How are we gonna find them?

170
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,230
Ahsoka, you should know by now.

171
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,100
If you want to find a lowlife...

172
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,400
You start at the saloon.

173
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,160
Hey, ladies, where are we going next?

174
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,660
I love you guys.

175
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,390
The fugitives are already gone.

176
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,850
All three of them were here?

177
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,270
Two came in, met the third.

178
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,770
When did they leave?

179
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:08,360
Nothing's free on Nal Hutta,
especially information.

180
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,530
I don't have time for games.

181
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,210
You just missed them.

182
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,030
Keep talking.

183
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,630
I heard one of them say
they just bought a ship.

184
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,710
Let's go, Snips.

185
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,850
<i>Captain Rex, I need to speak
with General Skywalker.</i>

186
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,470
<i>He's not responding to my calls.</i>

187
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,810
Sir, General Skywalker is unavailable.

188
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,770
<i>Where is he, Captain?</i>

189
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,850
I can't say, sir.

190
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,650
<i>You can't or you won't?</i>

191
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,980
Anakin is on Nal Hutta.

192
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,190
<i>Nal Hutta?</i>

193
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,610
Protecting me
is only postponing the problem,

194
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,030
not solving it.

195
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,160
<i>With all due respect, Chancellor,
the Council has a plan in place.</i>

196
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,910
Yes, and so does Moralo Eval,

197
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,370
who appears to be several steps ahead
of you.

198
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,500
For that reason,
I asked Anakin to take action.

199
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,260
<i>He is confident he can find the fugitives
and stop this plot against me.</i>

200
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:14,800
<i>I suggest you have more faith
in young Skywalker.</i>

201
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:19,890
<i>Captain, if you must escort me home,
I'm leaving now.</i>

202
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,600
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

203
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:25,270
This is exactly what Obi-Wan
didn't want to happen.

204
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,320
If I warn him, it could blow his cover,
get him killed.

205
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,450
Kill Hardeen, Skywalker might.

206
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,280
Or die trying, he may.

207
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,160
Warn them both, you must.

208
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,500
Overdue, the truth is.

209
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,220
How do you know
they couldn't have gotten very far?

210
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,720
So you only gave them enough fuel

211
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,730
to reach the nearest filling station
on Orondia,

212
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,430
which is owned by your brother?

213
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,280
Well, that's a nice little
money-making scam.

214
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:05,560
We better get going.

215
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,450
Orondia's pretty deserted.

216
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,070
They may steal a ship there,

217
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,650
to throw us off their trail.

218
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,540
I like your thinking.

219
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,090
Here,
take it. I just want to get out of here.

220
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,590
We're being swindled.

221
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,640
Who sells a ship with only enough fuel
to get to this lousy rock?

222
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:42,060
The way I see it,
you keep paying off everybody but me.

223
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,350
Yeah, why is that?

224
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,000
Look! It's Cad Bane.

225
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Are you sure?

226
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,490
Ugh, who else wears a hat like that?

227
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,950
Good point.

228
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,050
Now what?

229
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,800
Jedi!

230
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,240
Take over! I'll bring them down!

231
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,590
I'll take care of him.

232
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,220
No! It's my turn to kill a Jedi!

233
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,510
Anakin.

234
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,620
You're going to pay for what you did.

235
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,960
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

236
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,420
This is for Obi-Wan.

237
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,100
You can thank me later, Hardeen.

238
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,970
You had your chance to kill him.

239
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,470
Now it's my turn.

240
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,300
Anakin, don't follow me.

241
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,620
The ship is still operational.

242
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:07,570
I got it working. Now
let's get out of here.

243
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,530
You're lucky we're in a hurry, little lady.

244
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,910
We'll have to dance another time.

245
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,710
Master!

246
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,060
Master, are you all right?

247
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,190
What is it? What's wrong?

248
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,270
That's why I felt a connection.

249
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,570
Obi-Wan is still alive.

250
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,740
- I don't understand.
- I don't, either.

251
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,360
But we're gonna get
to the bottom of this. Believe me.
