1
00:00:18,976 --> 00:00:20,603
Stolen secrets!

2
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:24,649
Villainous mercenary Cad Bane
was hired by Darth Sidious

3
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:28,319
to steal a holocron
from the vaults of the Jedi Temple.

4
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,405
After fleeing the scene of the crime,

5
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,574
Bane hunted down
and captured Master Bolla Ropal,

6
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,328
who has a crystal which holds secrets
of the Jedi Order.

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,332
As a Separatist fleet arrives
to help the bounty hunter,

8
00:00:41,457 --> 00:00:44,335
Anakin Skywalker races in
to cut off their escape

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,839
and stop Bane
from delivering the stolen holocron.

10
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:53,177
- I guess we're going down with the ship.
- Roger, roger.

11
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,684
General, we're receiving
an urgent transmission from the planet.

12
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:09,026
General Skywalker,
our base has been overrun!

13
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,862
There's no possibility of evacuation!

14
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,598
They've taken General Ropal
and the holocron memory crystal.

15
00:01:16,492 --> 00:01:18,536
Do you know where they've taken them?

16
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:22,540
Sorry, sir. We tried to stop them,
but they left the outpost.

17
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,044
Wait a second.
There's too much interference.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,547
Transmitter's been destroyed
at the source, sir.

19
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,049
We have to find out
what ship Master Ropal is on.

20
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,407
You will remain conscious, Master Jedi.

21
00:01:56,532 --> 00:01:59,619
The bounty hunter
has some questions for you.

22
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:04,457
Attach mind limiters, pain pulsers
and give him a full dose of X-C33.

23
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,968
Sir, that Republic ship has destroyed
our escort and is blocking our escape.

24
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:18,638
Whoever's commanding that cruiser
is a bold one.

25
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:22,433
Move us out of the battle zone
and prepare to jump to hyperspace.

26
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,061
I have a small favor to ask our Jedi guest.

27
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,069
General, a Separatist command ship
is fleeing the battle.

28
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,949
You think they have Master Ropal
on board as a prisoner?

29
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,283
I'm sure of it.

30
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,370
Admiral, intercept them
before they can jump to hyperspace.

31
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:46,332
- I'll ready the troops for boarding.
- Boarding? We have no boarding craft.

32
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,544
We were prepared to land on the planet,
not aboard another ship.

33
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:53,673
- You can't be serious.
- I am, Admiral. Thank you for your opinion.

34
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,238
Now, target their hyperdrive.
We don't want them getting away.

35
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,814
Sir! Captain!

36
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:13,943
Sir, they hit the power converters
so we can't go into hyperspace.

37
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,487
Hmm. I wonder what the Jedi are planning.

38
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,243
I've rounded up three brigades, sir.
Where are we going?

39
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:24,579
We're going to board a Separatist frigate,

40
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,832
rescue Master Ropal
and recover an archive holocron.

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,878
We have no assault craft, sir.
Only a couple of fighters and The Twilight.

42
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,881
Waiting for orders, sir.

43
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,924
And the plan is?

44
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,551
Just curious.

45
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:46,851
I came down to see if I could be
of any help, General Skywalker.

46
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:50,354
Actually, you can.
Activate those walkers, Admiral.

47
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,527
You are not thinking of using those
to transport the clones to that frigate.

48
00:03:56,611 --> 00:04:02,033
- Well, they are pressurized.
- And they're equipped with magnetic feet.

49
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:06,704
- Hmm. Good call.
- Master, you're a genius.

50
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,540
Those walkers are designed for terrain,
not space.

51
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,793
Rex, load them up. Let's go, Snips.

52
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:18,883
Execute Battalion, take AT-AT 300!
Carnivore Battalion, Walker 773! Let's go!

53
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,518
Simply open this little box of yours,

54
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,229
so I can get the information
from this crystal,

55
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,899
and your suffering will come to an end.

56
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:41,864
You will never get me
to unlock the holocron.

57
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:45,785
Unfortunately, I don't have time
to discuss this with you.

58
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,995
Hit him again, full power.

59
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,543
I'm not sure
how much more of this he can take.

60
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,880
- Are you a medical droid?
- No, sir.

61
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,841
- Then step back and shut up.
- Roger, roger.

62
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,385
More power.

63
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,607
- We've lost all his vital signs.
- Check.

64
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,196
- He is no longer functioning.
- Drop him.

65
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,622
He's dead.

66
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,709
Looks like we will have to find
another Jedi to open this holocron.

67
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,878
Only next time,
I will try a different method.

68
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:11,495
When Darth Sidious asked me
to loan you the Federation fleet,

69
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,914
he didn't say you were going to war!

70
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:17,501
Bane, you have already lost
four of my ships.

71
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,754
I hope you can pay for all of this.

72
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,550
One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal I was after.

73
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,427
When my benefactor gets this,

74
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,555
he will compensate you
for your puny fleet.

75
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:34,185
Sounds like the Jedi want it back.

76
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,041
The Jedi are overwhelming
our vulture droids.

77
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,877
- Should we send out reinforcements?
- No.

78
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,421
- What are you doing?
- Did you say, "No"?

79
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,799
- Mmm-hmm.
- Roger, roger.

80
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,761
The Jedi will board the ship
and get the holocron back!

81
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:11,639
Transmit the information
and close the deal immediately!

82
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,893
I can't. Only a Jedi can access the device.

83
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:20,231
Fortunately, there are two Jedi
on their way to help me.

84
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,900
One more than we need for our purposes.

85
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:26,821
You'd better live through this.
I want my money, Bane.

86
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:28,489
You can count on it.

87
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,578
Artoo!

88
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,674
Wipe all the frigate's memory banks
and destroy every record of our mission.

89
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,926
Initiate the self-destruct sequence.

90
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,595
You, transfer all ship functions
to my wrist com.

91
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,266
I want control of doors,
gravity generators, everything.

92
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:56,392
Roger, roger.

93
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:58,644
The rest of you,
stay here and defend the bridge.

94
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,565
We're defending the bridge alone?
Against the Jedi?

95
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,275
I hate this job.

96
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,461
Don't shoot! I'm not the commander.
He's the commander!

97
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,966
Guess I'm the commander now.

98
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,636
Artoo, see if you can find Master Ropal.

99
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,642
One authentic Jedi holocron
and the memory crystal I was after.

100
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,645
Oh, no. He has both pieces now.

101
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,190
Rex, send a squad,
lock down the hangar bay

102
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,318
and destroy all the escape pods.
No one gets off this ship!

103
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,153
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,364
Artoo, you have to find Master Ropal.
Hurry!

105
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,742
What was that?

106
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:05,502
General Skywalker, one of the engines
on that frigate has exploded.

107
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,838
I caution you to avoid the aft section.

108
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,133
- How much damage is there?
- I suggest immediate evacuation.

109
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,302
Not until we get what we came for.

110
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,264
Spread out. While you take on the clones,

111
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,768
I will separate the Jedi
and lead one of them away.

112
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:30,110
Master, I found him!

113
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:37,243
Rex, have some men
take Master Ropal back to the Resolute.

114
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,829
We might not be able to find
the holocron in time, Master.

115
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,750
But if it's destroyed with the ship,
Nute Gunray won't get it either.

116
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:48,629
Maybe, but I'd rather
return it to the library personally.

117
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,634
Come on, Artoo.

118
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:58,555
Artoo says we're close. Stay sharp.

119
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,976
Ow!

120
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:03,394
Switch to night vision.

121
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,740
There!

122
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,088
Welcome, Jedi. We've been expecting you.

123
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,383
Kill them!

124
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,767
Let's make this a bit more interesting.

125
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,979
Lockdown!

126
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,819
Magnetics! You were trained for this!

127
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:03,037
Artoo, turn the gravity generators
back on!

128
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:33,108
Check your fire! Hit one of those shells
and this fight is over for all of us!

129
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,783
I'll get him, Master!

130
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,745
Ahsoka, wait! It's a trap!

131
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,459
Ahsoka, wait! We'll take him together!

132
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,386
Whoops!

133
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,109
You thought you could get away?

134
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:01,280
You're not much of a challenge, youngling.
I got you right where I want you.

135
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,158
Ow!

136
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,002
I'm not impressed.

137
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:40,277
General Skywalker, can you hear me?
Are you all right in there?

138
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,071
Yeah, I'm all right.
Get back to the hangar.

139
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,908
Find a transport,
but wait for us as long as you can.

140
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:47,284
We're on it, sir.

141
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,952
Ahsoka, do you copy?

142
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,632
There's a power surge
heading toward the bridge.

143
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:05,219
If you're there, get out immediately.
You must abandon your mission.

144
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,096
I don't have the holocron memory

145
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,308
and I seem to have misplaced
my Padawan.

146
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,644
The ship is tearing itself apart!

147
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:17,356
Move off to a safe distance, Admiral,
and await my signal for evacuation.

148
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,693
Of all the Jedi,
why did I have to end up with Skywalker?

149
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,864
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

150
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,825
Those binders have been
specially designed for Jedi.

151
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,996
The more you struggle,
the tighter they get.

152
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,667
- Impressed now, youngling?
- Not really.

153
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,803
Enjoy this while you can, sleemo.

154
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:51,056
This burning boat
is about to finish us both off.

155
00:14:51,139 --> 00:14:52,558
We have time.

156
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,144
The bond between a Jedi teacher
and his apprentice is strong.

157
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,856
Which means my Master
will be coming for me any minute.

158
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,237
Let's see if we can get
him here any faster.

159
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,371
You said we'd be safe back here.

160
00:15:14,454 --> 00:15:17,165
Come on,
there's three of us and only one of him.

161
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,375
It won't matter.

162
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:24,673
Sir, a Jedi is coming.
He looks very unhappy.

163
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,597
Your Master has gotten the message.

164
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,812
You have nowhere left to run,
bounty hunter.

165
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,232
Let me worry about that, Jedi.

166
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,901
If I activate this control,

167
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,780
the outside airlock will open
and she will be sucked into oblivion.

168
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,633
Do you think you can kill me
and then save her

169
00:15:50,657 --> 00:15:53,076
before she's pulled out into space?

170
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,329
It's a horrible way to die.

171
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,834
Besides, isn't negotiation the Jedi way?

172
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,339
What do you want?

173
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:08,884
This holocron carries information
I've been paid to collect.

174
00:16:08,967 --> 00:16:11,887
I can't unlock it, but you can.

175
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:15,390
The last Jedi who had it wouldn't open it.

176
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:18,060
I hope you don't make the same mistake.

177
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:25,817
We don't have much time.
Hurry it up, Jedi, or she dies!

178
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:32,658
- No, Master! Don't do it!
- I can't let you die, Ahsoka.

179
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,409
Master, no!

180
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,125
- We'll deal with the holocron later.
- How touching.

181
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,131
All units make for that shuttle!

182
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,917
Captain, the main reactor is exposed.
It will implode at any moment.

183
00:17:25,168 --> 00:17:28,171
Yes, sir. We're trying to make our way
to the shuttle now.

184
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,507
- Get out of there!
- Sir! Yes, sir.

185
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,342
You two find the General and help him!

186
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,011
This frigate's not going to last.
We have to get out of here!

187
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:36,179
Yes, sir!

188
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,518
Come about. We need to put some
distance between us and that frigate.

189
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,209
Now I will combine this holocron

190
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,297
with the memory crystal
I acquired from your dead Jedi friend.

191
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:20,182
My employers will be most pleased.

192
00:18:51,254 --> 00:18:56,301
- Bane, did the Jedi cooperate with you?
- With some encouragement.

193
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,053
I have access to the holocron

194
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:00,430
and all the information
the memory contains.

195
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:02,599
I only have to get off this ship.

196
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:08,438
Maybe you should transmit it to me now.
Then I can send another ship for you.

197
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,651
No thanks, Viceroy.
I have a plan for my own escape.

198
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,495
Hold it right there!
You're not going anywhere, bounty hunter.

199
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,292
Rex, I hope you found us
a ride off this bucket!

200
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,587
We've got to leave now.
The reactor's gonna blow. We cannot wait!

201
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,382
You'll have to.
I'm going after that bounty hunter.

202
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,969
Master, wait! Stop!

203
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,139
This is the way to the hangar!
We must get off the ship now!

204
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:48,103
- I can't let Bane get away.
- Patience, Master.

205
00:19:48,603 --> 00:19:49,855
Patience.

206
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,524
You're right.

207
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:19,175
Come on, come on!

208
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:31,521
- Trooper, did you get the holocron?
- No, sir.

209
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,317
- I'll get it, Master.
- No time. Rex, get us out of here.

210
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,709
Well, it looks like
the holocron was destroyed,

211
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,211
but at least the Separatists didn't get it.

212
00:20:56,379 --> 00:20:59,174
Bane's dead, but I can still feel him.

213
00:21:14,397 --> 00:21:18,902
Master, I'm sorry
I let that mercenary get the upper hand.

214
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,740
It wasn't your fault, Ahsoka.
It was mine, start to finish.

215
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,415
So, did you manage
to recover the holocron

216
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,751
or capture the bounty hunter?

217
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,754
Um, no and no.

218
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,090
I see.

219
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,928
So the mission was
your usual version of success, then?

220
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,265
If by success you mean, "I won," then yes.
