1
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,820
A royal welcome!

2
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,340
Sent to investigate allegations

3
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:21,981
that Mandalore was joining
Count Dooku's Separatists,

4
00:00:22,102 --> 00:00:24,541
Obi-Wan Kenobi was reunited
with an old friend,

5
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:26,741
the Duchess Satine of Kalevala.

6
00:00:26,862 --> 00:00:28,782
While Satine claimed
Mandalore's intentions

7
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:33,103
were to remain neutral during the war,
an attack on the capital city led Obi-Wan

8
00:00:33,144 --> 00:00:36,903
to the discovery of a terrorist organization
known as Death Watch.

9
00:00:36,985 --> 00:00:38,744
Now the Duchess travels to the Senate

10
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,424
so she can plead her case
against her involvement in the war

11
00:00:41,505 --> 00:00:44,505
as the Jedi prepare a defense
against her opponents.

12
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,944
You know your marching orders.

13
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:48,945
The safety of the Duchess Satine is
of the utmost importance.

14
00:00:49,027 --> 00:00:50,305
The Death Watch will stop at nothing

15
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,386
to assassinate her
before she pleads her case to the Senate.

16
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:57,627
The Death Watch may be backed
by the Separatists, so stay sharp.

17
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,828
Artoo, use your scanners to probe
for any suspicious droid activity.

18
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,707
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that will be all.

19
00:01:07,749 --> 00:01:08,748
Yes?

20
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,990
The Duchess
and her retinue requests your presence.

21
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,189
Very well.

22
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,990
I sense some anxiety from you
about the Duchess.

23
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:23,391
- She couldn't be in safer hands.
- Yes, I know.

24
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:27,192
- Then why...
- Never mind. It's all in the past.

25
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:31,592
- Oh, so you're close to her?
- I knew her. A long time ago.

26
00:01:43,635 --> 00:01:46,355
All secure here.
Let's move on to the next sector.

27
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:59,757
War is intolerable!

28
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:03,398
We have been deceived into thinking
that we must be a part of it.

29
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:06,278
I say the moment
we committed to fighting,

30
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,198
we already lost.

31
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:09,318
Excuse me, Your Grace,

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,000
are you suggesting we oppose the war
on humanitarian grounds?

33
00:02:13,121 --> 00:02:16,519
I'm going to oppose it
as an affront to life itself.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,840
As the designated regent
of 1,500 systems,

35
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:21,800
I speak for thousands of worlds

36
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:25,082
that have urged me to allow them
to stay neutral in this war.

37
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:27,922
And yet some might argue
that the strongest defense

38
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:30,322
is a swift and decisive offense.

39
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:38,244
You are quite the general now,
aren't you, Master Kenobi?

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,124
Forgive me for interrupting, Your Highness,
I meant no disrespect.

41
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,484
Really?

44
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:54,007
- Your Highness is too kind.
- You're right. I am.

45
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:59,727
Allow me to introduce
my fellow Jedi, Anakin Skywalker.

46
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:01,327
Your servant, my lady.

47
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:06,128
I remember a time when Jedi were
not generals, but peacekeepers.

48
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,609
We are protectors, Highness.
Yours at the moment. We fight for peace.

49
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,329
What an amusing contradiction.

50
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:17,250
What Master Skywalker means is that we
are acting at the behest of Your Highness

51
00:03:17,331 --> 00:03:19,490
to protect you from the Death Watch
and the Separatists,

52
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,451
who don't share
your neutral point of view.

53
00:03:21,531 --> 00:03:23,331
I asked for no such thing.

54
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:27,012
That may be so,
but a majority of your court did.

55
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,933
I do not remember you
as one to hide behind excuses.

56
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:36,853
I do not remember you
as one to shrink from responsibilities.

57
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:42,294
I am certain we all agree
Duchess Satine and General Kenobi

58
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:45,815
have proven there are two sides
to every dilemma.

59
00:03:45,856 --> 00:03:46,934
Indeed.

60
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:50,495
Now, in regard to the Senate vote,
we think...

61
00:03:50,616 --> 00:03:53,975
I think a multitude makes discord,
not good council.

62
00:03:54,017 --> 00:03:56,176
Right again, my lady.

63
00:03:56,217 --> 00:04:00,537
There may be two sides to every dilemma,
but the Duchess only favors hers.

64
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:10,379
I'll check out the south quadrant.

65
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,100
- Careful over there, it's dark.
- Yeah, very funny, Mixer.

66
00:04:30,223 --> 00:04:33,302
Stop messing around. That's not funny.

67
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:39,103
Droids.

68
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:46,264
A Republic military presence is the only
sure defense against the Separatists.

69
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:49,585
Even extremists can be reasoned with.

70
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:53,586
Perhaps, if one can be heard
over the clanking of their battle droids.

71
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:57,307
- The sarcasm of a soldier.
- The delusion of a dreamer.

72
00:04:57,748 --> 00:05:01,267
Duchess, Master Jedi, it's been a long trip.

73
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:04,667
I think we could all use
a little rest and refreshment.

74
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:10,788
Hear, hear. Now let us put politics aside
until after dinner.

75
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,028
- Fine!
- Fine!

76
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:23,631
Stand by for lightspeed. Engage.

77
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:29,311
My side's secure.
What do you got, Redeye?

78
00:05:29,512 --> 00:05:30,912
Redeye, do you copy?

79
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:50,396
- You and Satine have a history.
- An extended mission when I was younger.

80
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,996
Master Qui-Gon and I spent
a year on Mandalore,

81
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:56,676
protecting the Duchess from insurgents
who had threatened her world.

82
00:06:00,798 --> 00:06:03,077
They sent bounty hunters after us.

83
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,077
We were always on the run,
living hand to mouth,

84
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,598
- never sure what the next day would bring.
- Sounds romantic.

85
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:31,522
A civil war killed most of Satine's people,
hence her aversion to violence.

86
00:06:31,603 --> 00:06:33,642
When she returned,
she took on the difficult task

87
00:06:33,683 --> 00:06:36,723
- of rebuilding her world alone.
- You didn't stay to help her?

88
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,763
That would have been problematic.

89
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:43,243
My duty as a Jedi
demanded I be elsewhere.

90
00:06:44,725 --> 00:06:45,844
Demanded?

91
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:49,765
But it's obvious you had feelings for her.
Surely that would affect your decision.

92
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,086
Oh, it did. I live by the Jedi Code.

93
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,967
Of course. As Master Yoda says,
"A Jedi must not form attachments. "

94
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:02,047
Yes. But he usually leaves out
the undercurrent of remorse.

95
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:03,127
Yes, Captain?

96
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,248
General, something's wrong
with Skywalker's astromech.

97
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:10,048
Scared him real good, sir.
I've also lost contact with two of my men.

98
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,128
I'm on my way down to assist you.

99
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:15,329
I'll go, Master. If there's something
dangerous down there,

100
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,090
the clones and I can handle it.

101
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,570
Deep-fried nuna leg. Mmm! Delicious.

102
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,371
I beg your pardon, Senators,

103
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:32,452
our men are investigating
a situation belowdecks.

104
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:35,613
I respectfully ask you to wait here
until it is settled.

105
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:40,253
All right, men. What's the problem?
I'm missing dinner.

106
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:43,494
We're not sure yet, sir. But there's still
no sign of Mixer and Redeye.

107
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,694
What's the matter, buddy?

108
00:07:46,855 --> 00:07:48,614
I know, I know. But I'm here now.

109
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,536
Use your scanners.
See if something's out of place.

110
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,617
Well, what have we here?

111
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,618
Looks like the contents of this box
are missing.

112
00:08:10,659 --> 00:08:12,578
Or it got up and walked away.

113
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:16,299
All right, fan out, separate squads.
I'll contact Obi-Wan.

114
00:08:20,301 --> 00:08:21,940
Please excuse me.

115
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,381
Anakin, what have you found?

116
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:28,581
There's a large open container,
and the contents are missing.

117
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:30,622
And I still have two men unaccounted for.

118
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:34,782
That's not good. Keep things quiet,
I'll stay with the senators.

119
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,262
Got it.

120
00:08:37,383 --> 00:08:39,143
What's up? Did you find something?

121
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:52,225
There you are. Redeye, where have you
been? You've had us all worried.

122
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,426
Redeye?

123
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,469
The lift!

124
00:09:30,992 --> 00:09:33,071
Obi-Wan!
There's assassin probes down here!

125
00:09:33,352 --> 00:09:35,592
One made it up the lift.
I'll try to hold the others here.

126
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:37,712
Quickly! Secure the lifts!

127
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:45,354
Help!

128
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:55,356
There might be one left.

129
00:09:55,476 --> 00:09:56,996
- Let's spread out and find it.
Watch it!

130
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:10,438
They're everywhere!
- Get behind me!

131
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,599
Get it off!

132
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,961
Do you always carry a deactivator?

133
00:10:30,962 --> 00:10:33,762
Just because I'm a pacifist
doesn't mean I won't defend myself.

134
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,481
Now you sound like a Jedi.

135
00:10:43,524 --> 00:10:45,643
Good work, men. You too, buddy.

136
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:51,644
Assassin droid.
How did that monster end up in the hold?

137
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:54,285
The question is,
who smuggled him onboard?

138
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:00,647
Just like that swarm of venom-mites
on Draboon, remember?

139
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:03,486
How could I forget? I still have the scar.

140
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,567
Begging your pardon, Duchess,

141
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:08,488
I distinctly remember
carrying you to safety.

142
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:11,648
I meant the scar I got
after you fell and dropped me.

143
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:13,248
Oh. Yes.

144
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:16,689
I'm looking for the droid
that services the cargo bay.

145
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,250
Uh, yes, sir. Are all those creatures dead?

146
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:23,290
That's what I'm trying to find out.

147
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:25,250
You're in charge
of the cargo manifest, right?

148
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:30,091
- Uh, yes, I have it right here.
- Well, where did they come from?

149
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:33,932
It is right here on the manifest.

150
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:36,292
"For immediate delivery to Coruscant.

151
00:11:36,372 --> 00:11:38,172
"One container marked medical supplies. "

152
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:41,893
There's no name on this chart!
There's no indication of who shipped it.

153
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:44,414
No, sir, just the Senate stamp,

154
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,254
always accepted for transport here
aboard the Coronet.

155
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:58,776
One of our four distinguished senators
appears to be a traitor.

156
00:11:58,856 --> 00:12:00,136
I sense it, too.

157
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:06,057
It looks like one of our little visitors
is still alive.

158
00:12:06,138 --> 00:12:08,617
I have an idea how to expose the turncoat.

159
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:12,098
Return to the hull of the ship.
Destroy the last assassin droids.

160
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:14,739
I'll find out
which of the senators is the traitor.

161
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,900
- Duchess, you're not eating.
- I have no appetite.

162
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:26,580
Begging your pardon,
you must keep up your strength.

163
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,101
By all means, be my guest, Senator.

164
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:34,783
If you insist. Ah, dessert! Excellent!

165
00:12:34,863 --> 00:12:36,862
This morsel might prove too much

166
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,902
even for the legendary appetite
of Orn Free Taa.

167
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,543
Enjoy.

168
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:47,344
On second thought,
it wouldn't agree with me.

169
00:12:47,425 --> 00:12:51,264
My theory is
our little friend will attack the Duchess

170
00:12:51,346 --> 00:12:53,825
and anyone who defends her.

171
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:57,305
Anyone that is,
except the traitor who programmed it.

172
00:12:57,586 --> 00:13:00,585
Take it away! Please!

173
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:03,587
Obi-Wan, this line of questioning
borders on torture!

174
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:13,748
I assure our pacifist Duchess
that all is under control.

175
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:16,149
I'm trying to expose a bigger threat.

176
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,429
Interesting.

177
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:22,710
The droid displays unusual hostility
toward the honorable Kin Robb,

178
00:13:27,631 --> 00:13:30,831
but it seems to like you, Senator Merrik.

179
00:13:31,832 --> 00:13:33,271
Well, Prince?

180
00:13:35,393 --> 00:13:36,952
Really, General Kenobi,

181
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:38,191
you're quite clever!

182
00:13:53,115 --> 00:13:54,835
You're coming with me.

183
00:14:01,557 --> 00:14:05,717
Anakin! Tal Merrik is the traitor,
and he's taken Satine hostage.

184
00:14:06,157 --> 00:14:09,518
Copy that, but I've got
problems of my own right now.

185
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,479
- Cody, Rex, have you found anything?
All quiet over here, sir.

186
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,880
Wait a minute.

187
00:14:39,043 --> 00:14:40,083
Thanks, little guy.

188
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:43,042
Well, we found the little ones.
What about the mother?

189
00:14:43,164 --> 00:14:44,163
Haven't seen it.

190
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:12,007
No! Please! I beg you!

191
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:16,408
- Monster! You're a horrid monster!
- Get used to it.

192
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,449
Did you find them?

193
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,049
No, but I've stationed troopers
at every escape pod.

194
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,571
Merrik will try to signal his allies for help.
We have to find him.

195
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:34,811
This may not be the time to ask,
but were you and Satine ever...

196
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:38,372
I don't see how that has any bearing
on the situation at hand.

197
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,613
- Death Watch Command.
- Tal Merrik here.

198
00:15:49,696 --> 00:15:53,294
Senator Merrik.
Have you completed your mission?

199
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:57,095
Yes, sir. I have the Duchess,
but I'll need help getting her away.

200
00:15:57,176 --> 00:16:00,656
Very good.
Reinforcements are on their way.

201
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:19,738
I'll take care of this, Obi-Wan.
You, go find your girlfriend.

202
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,179
Right. No, Anakin, she's not my...

203
00:16:34,102 --> 00:16:36,501
Come in, Kenobi, you're expected.

204
00:16:36,582 --> 00:16:40,461
Tal Merrik, you are under arrest.
Release the Duchess.

205
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:44,582
Hmm. I took the precaution of wiring
the ship's engines to explode.

206
00:16:44,664 --> 00:16:47,384
I press this remote and we all die.

207
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,464
Obi, if you have any respect for me,

208
00:16:49,585 --> 00:16:52,984
you will not take such risks
with so many people's lives at stake.

209
00:16:53,105 --> 00:16:55,064
Satine, don't.

210
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,791
This is Merrik.

211
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:38,231
Stand by to disengage.
Say farewell, Duchess.

212
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:41,592
Obi-Wan, it looks like
I may never see you again.

213
00:17:41,673 --> 00:17:45,313
I don't know quite how to say this,
but I've loved you

214
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:48,553
from the moment you came to my aid
all those years ago.

215
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:50,273
I don't believe this.

216
00:17:50,594 --> 00:17:53,874
Satine, this is hardly
the time or place for...

217
00:17:56,355 --> 00:18:01,316
All right. Had you said the word,
I would have left the Jedi Order.

218
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,996
That is touching. Truly it is.

219
00:18:05,077 --> 00:18:08,197
But it's making me sick,
and we really must be going.

220
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:12,318
You have the romantic soul
of a slug, Merrik.

221
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:16,518
And slugs are so often trod upon.

222
00:18:17,719 --> 00:18:19,518
Interesting turnabout,

223
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,638
but even if I do not deliver the Duchess
alive to the Separatists,

224
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,359
I still win.

225
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,600
The second I'm away, I'll hit the remote
and blow the Coronet to bits.

226
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:30,480
I will not allow that.

227
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:32,680
What will you do? If you shoot me,

228
00:18:32,722 --> 00:18:37,801
you prove yourself a hypocrite
to every pacifist ideal you hold dear.

229
00:18:38,363 --> 00:18:41,721
And you, Kenobi,
you are no stranger to violence.

230
00:18:41,803 --> 00:18:45,363
You'd be hailed as a hero
by everyone on this ship.

231
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,044
Almost everyone.

232
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:51,723
Come on, then. Who will strike first

233
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,924
and brand themselves
a cold-blooded killer?

234
00:19:04,848 --> 00:19:08,086
- Anakin...
- What? He was gonna blow up the ship.

235
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,448
Obi-Wan, I...

236
00:19:13,489 --> 00:19:16,608
General Skywalker, the last of the droids
have been defeated, sir.

237
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:18,887
Very good, Cody.

238
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:23,250
I must get back
to the business of diplomacy.

239
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:28,370
As you say, Duchess, some other time.

240
00:20:01,696 --> 00:20:03,536
A job well done, Master Jedi.

241
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:07,137
- Thank you, Chancellor.
- Your Excellency.

242
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,699
How ironic to meet again
only to find we're on opposing sides.

243
00:20:20,739 --> 00:20:23,259
The needs of your people are
all that matter.

244
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:26,619
They couldn't be in better hands
with you to guide their future.

245
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,180
Kind words indeed
from a mindful and committed Jedi.

246
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:32,900
- And yet...
- What?

247
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:37,982
- I'm still not sure about the beard.
- Why? What's wrong with it?

248
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:40,862
It hides too much of your handsome face.

249
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:46,383
What was that all about?

250
00:20:48,384 --> 00:20:51,263
- A very remarkable woman.
- She is indeed.
