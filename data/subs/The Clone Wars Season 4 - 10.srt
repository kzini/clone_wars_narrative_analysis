1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,290
<i>While fighting to control
the darkened world of Umbara,</i>

2
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,540
<i>Anakin Skywalker's battalion
is temporarily placed under the command</i>

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,710
<i>of Jedi General Pong Krell.</i>

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,710
<i>As Krell's disastrous strategies
result in increasing casualties,</i>

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,340
<i>his men begin to turn against him.</i>

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,630
<i>Captain Rex struggles to balance loyalty</i>

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,550
<i>between his commander
and his fellow men.</i>

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,640
<i>Under his watch, Fives and Jesse
disobey Krell's orders,</i>

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,990
<i>resulting in their court-martial.</i>

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,360
General Krell, I respectfully request

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,000
you reconsider court-martialing
Fives and Jesse.

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,280
The actions of ARC trooper
5555 and CT-5597

13
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,000
were a clear act of treachery
and disregard for my command.

14
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,250
If punishment isn't swift,

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:11,380
their defiance may inspire others
to follow suit.

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,920
Sir, the men are with you.

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,760
It's just that some of them feel you're
putting their lives in danger needlessly.

18
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,180
All the more reason
to send a clear message

19
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,470
that I am in charge
and insubordination will not be tolerated.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,350
The truth is,
these clones have had a difficult time

21
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,060
respecting my command
since the beginning.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,400
I've seen it before.

23
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,610
Some clones are just defective.
They aren't able to succumb to authority.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,740
You're right, Captain.

25
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,120
I don't think I can court-martial them.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
It will only be a waste of time
and that's something we don't have.

27
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,040
I'm afraid they'll need to be disposed of.

28
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,870
Prepare a squad for execution.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,130
What? But, sir...

30
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,540
You heard me, Captain.

31
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,710
Have it done immediately,
or I'll do it myself.

32
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,660
Fives, Jesse, I'm sorry.

33
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
General Krell has ordered
your execution immediately.

34
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:35,710
What? But how? He can't do this!

35
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,800
He has authority to render
punishment during combat.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,970
I can understand a court-martial
and locking us up in the brig,

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,550
but executing us?

38
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,350
I tried to convince him that it's my fault,
but he wouldn't let me.

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,600
Rex, you have to face it,
he's been using you.

40
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,490
He needs your loyalty
to control the others.

41
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,190
I won't let him get away with this.

42
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,820
Don't beat yourself up about it.

43
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,950
We made our choice.
We knew what the price was.

44
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,530
Speak for yourself.

45
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,240
Still got your sense of humor, I see.

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,160
- Yeah, who said I was joking?
- Well...

47
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,500
I guess this is it.

48
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,720
Line up the prisoners.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,690
Well,
I've officially lost my sense of humor.

50
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,490
Will the prisoners
request to be blindfolded?

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,750
I'll take that as a no.

52
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,750
I hope you can live with yourself, Dogma.

53
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,260
Ready weapons.

54
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,840
Never thought we'd go out this way.

55
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,510
Aim.

56
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,030
Wait!

57
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,180
This is wrong and we all know it!

58
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,230
The general is making a mistake,
and he needs to be called on it.

59
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,400
No clone should have to go out this way!

60
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,110
We're loyal soldiers!

61
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,110
We follow orders, but we are not
a bunch of unthinking droids!

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,240
We are men! We must be trusted
to make the right decisions!

63
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,450
Especially when the orders
we are given are wrong!

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fire!

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,010
What... What happened?

66
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,980
They're doing the right thing, Dogma.

67
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,270
Because if this is how soldiers
are rewarded for heroic actions,

68
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,060
then one day, every man in this battalion
may face a similar fate.

69
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
- Take off their binders.
- No!

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,450
We have orders!
We have to go through with this!

71
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,070
Good luck finding anyone to do it.

72
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,580
You wanted us, sir?

73
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,790
I ordered those clones to be destroyed.

74
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,880
You are making a mistake
by crossing me, clone.

75
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,150
It's Captain, sir.

76
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,930
- General, there's an incoming transmission.
- Put it through.

77
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,480
<i>General, the Umbarans
have stepped up their offensive.</i>

78
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,620
<i>We're holding them off,</i>

79
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,756
<i>but their squadrons have ambushed
one of our platoons,</i>

80
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,530
<i>seizing weapons and uniforms.</i>

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,460
<i>We believe they may be planning
to launch a massive attack.</i>

82
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,240
Looks like you have your stay
of execution for now.

83
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,870
Lock the traitors in the brig, and prepare
your platoons to move out immediately.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,290
We need to pre-empt the enemy

85
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,040
by hitting them now
with everything we've got.

86
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,130
We're finally going to take the capital.

87
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,380
And, Captain,
make sure the troops are aware

88
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,970
that the enemy may disguise themselves
as clones to try to trick us.

89
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,470
I will, sir.

90
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,950
Stay alert.

91
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,070
The enemy has our weapons and our armor,

92
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,290
they may try to trick us with an ambush.

93
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,660
Watch out, Dogma!

94
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,500
I saw that thing attack Hardcase.

95
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,750
It'll chew you up and spit you out.

96
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,850
Here, watch.

97
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,350
Ew!

98
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,440
- Gross.
- We're under attack!

99
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,810
- Where's the enemy?
- I don't know! I can't see anything.

100
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,530
Get those mortars up here!

101
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,040
Anyone have a visual?

102
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,540
Negative. It's too dark.

103
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,040
Wait! I see them!

104
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,050
They're disguised as clones, all right.

105
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,980
- Captain, where are you?
<i>- We're sustaining heavy casualties!</i>

106
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,920
What?

107
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,470
Everyone, stop firing!
We're shooting at our own men!

108
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,180
They're not Umbarans! They're clones!

109
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,470
Take off your helmets!
Show them you're not the enemy.

110
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,060
- They're clones!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

111
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,280
Everyone, stop firing.

112
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:32,860
Cease fire! They're not Umbarans.
They're clones!

113
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,150
What the...

114
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,580
Look! We're clones! We're all clones!

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,750
What?

116
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,530
This can't be happening.
What have we done?

117
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:18,660
I don't understand.
Why did these troopers attack us?

118
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,830
Captain, I've found their platoon leader.
It's Waxer, he's still alive.

119
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,970
Waxer.

120
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,100
Tell me who gave you the orders
to attack us.

121
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,860
It... It was General Krell.

122
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,320
He sent us to these coordinates
to stop the enemy.

123
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,410
We thought they were wearing our armor,

124
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,330
but it was...

125
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,330
You.

126
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,550
We all know who's responsible
for what happened out there.

127
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,880
What we don't know, is why.

128
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,050
Something has to be done.

129
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,760
What I'm proposing is highly treasonous.

130
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,560
If any man chooses to opt out, do it now.

131
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,650
From this point forward,
we are entering uncharted territory.

132
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,490
My orders are, we arrest General Krell
for treason against the Republic.

133
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,860
General Krell, you are being
relieved of duty.

134
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,080
It's treason then.

135
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,080
Surrender, General.

136
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,130
- You're committing mutiny, Captain.
- Explain your actions!

137
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,050
My actions?

138
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,470
For ordering your troops
against one another.

139
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,800
Oh, that.

140
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,140
I'm surprised you were
able to figure it out,

141
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,470
for a clone.

142
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,650
Surrender, General. You're outnumbered!

143
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,830
You dare to attack a Jedi?

144
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,920
I will not be undermined
by creatures bred in some laboratory!

145
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,340
Get him!

146
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,290
Hold it right there!

147
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,880
- Lower your weapon, Dogma!
- I can't do that, sir.

148
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,130
- That's an order!
- It's my duty!

149
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,470
You're all traitors!

150
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,406
I used to believe that being a good soldier

151
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,720
meant doing everything they told you.

152
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,430
That's how they engineered us.

153
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,020
But we're not droids.
We're not programmed.

154
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,810
You have to learn
to make your own decisions.

155
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,900
Dogma, don't do it.

156
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,250
Take him to the brig.
Troopers, don't let General Krell escape!

157
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,510
Anybody got anything?

158
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,380
<i>Negative, Captain. We lost him.</i>

159
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,930
<i>Wait!</i>

160
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,220
<i>He's too powerful!</i>

161
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,600
<i>Hurry!</i>

162
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
He's coming!

163
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,660
You should have listened to the
ARC trooper from the beginning, Captain.

164
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,550
He was right. I was using you.

165
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,970
- You've all been my pawns.
- Get him!

166
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,310
Captain Rex, this is Tup.
If you can, force the General towards me!

167
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,850
- What? Why?
<i>- Trust me, sir!</i>

168
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,820
Troopers, listen up!
Circle around, lure him towards Tup.

169
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,630
Hey, ugly, come and get me!

170
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,840
I stunned him, sir.

171
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,930
Nice work, Tup.

172
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,910
Why, General? Why kill your own men?

173
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,760
Because I can.

174
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,470
Because you fell for it.

175
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,460
Because you're inferior.

176
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,140
But you're a Jedi! How could you?

177
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,470
A Jedi?

178
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,760
I'm no longer naive enough to be a Jedi.

179
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,510
A new power is rising, I've foreseen it.

180
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,060
The Jedi are going to lose this war,

181
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,270
and the Republic will
be ripped apart from the inside.

182
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,610
In its place is going to rise a new order,

183
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,820
and I will rule as part of it.

184
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,820
You're a Separatist!

185
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:39,320
I serve no one's side, only my own.

186
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,450
And soon, my new master.

187
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,660
You're an agent of Dooku.

188
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,660
Not yet,
but when I get out of here, I will be.

189
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,170
After I've succeeded
in driving the Republic from Umbara,

190
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,840
the Count will reward my actions
and make me his new apprentice.

191
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,560
How could you do this? You had my trust!

192
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,140
My loyalty! I followed all of your orders,
and you made me kill my brothers.

193
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,190
That's because you were
the biggest fool of them all, Dogma.

194
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,440
I counted on blind loyalty like yours
to make my plan succeed.

195
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,990
That will never happen.

196
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,240
You're a traitor, General,
and you'll be dealt with as one.

197
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:24,620
You never learn, Captain.

198
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,330
The Umbarans are going
to retake this base.

199
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,370
And when they do, I will be free.

200
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,470
Captain, we've repaired the transmitter.
It looks like it was sabotaged.

201
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,270
We received a message
from General Kenobi.

202
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,100
His forces have captured the capital,

203
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,230
but the remaining Umbarans
are heading here!

204
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,070
Get everyone on the perimeter!
We need to prepare for a full-scale attack.

205
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes, sir!

206
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,990
Krell sabotaged the transmitter.
He's been against us from the beginning.

207
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,210
If the Umbarans get to him,
he'll turn over all our intel.

208
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,450
The defense codes, everything.

209
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,830
He'll strike a crippling
blow to the Republic.

210
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,080
Something has to be done.

211
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,500
We can't risk the possibility
that he might escape.

212
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,090
As long as Krell's alive,
he's a threat to every one of us.

213
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,970
I agree.

214
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,030
Turn around and step toward the wall.

215
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,080
On your knees.

216
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,960
You're in a position of power now.
How does it feel?

217
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,460
I said, on your knees.

218
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,090
It feels good, doesn't it?

219
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,350
But I can sense your fear.

220
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,730
You're shaking, aren't you?

221
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:18,650
What are you waiting for?
The Umbarans are getting closer.

222
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,070
I have to do this.

223
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,320
You can't do it, can you?

224
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,240
Eventually, you'll have to do

225
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:29,740
the right thing...

226
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,630
I... I had to.

227
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,340
He betrayed us.

228
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,090
General Kenobi's battalions have
routed the last hold-outs of Umbarans,

229
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,680
and we've secured all sectors.
We did it. We took Umbara.

230
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,390
What's the point of all this?

231
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,350
I mean, why?

232
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:39,810
I don't know, sir.
I don't think anybody knows.

233
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,900
But I do know that someday
this war is gonna end.

234
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,200
Then what? We're soldiers.
What happens to us then?
