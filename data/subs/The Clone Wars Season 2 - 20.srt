1
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,974
Calm before the storm!

2
00:00:19,016 --> 00:00:21,255
A rare and welcome respite
from endless battle

3
00:00:21,296 --> 00:00:24,376
awaits Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Mace Windu

4
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:28,097
as they travel through deep space
aboard the Jedi Cruiser Endurance.

5
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,337
Preparing to rendezvous
with a Republic frigate,

6
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:34,858
the Jedi remain unaware of a deadly peril
lying hidden in their midst.

7
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:38,379
War does not come with a guarantee.

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,860
No soldier gets the promise of safety,
survival, or victory.

9
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:46,341
But men, I guarantee you this:

10
00:00:46,782 --> 00:00:51,461
Every member of this Clone Youth Brigade
will have his moment.

11
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,942
And it is that moment
when you are no longer a cadet,

12
00:00:55,824 --> 00:00:57,743
you are a soldier.

13
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,104
There's the Jedi Cruiser.

14
00:01:01,665 --> 00:01:03,664
You have the best training in the galaxy,

15
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:07,665
but no one can train you for the moment
you look death in the eyes.

16
00:01:07,747 --> 00:01:11,346
What you do then,
and the soldier you become,

17
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,027
that is up to you.

18
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:18,347
Docking procedures begin shortly.
Until then,

19
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,148
dismissed!

20
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:36,191
- Who's the new guy with the long hair?
- Some last-minute replacement.

21
00:01:37,113 --> 00:01:38,512
Looks green to me.

22
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:45,554
- Hey. What outfit you from?
-322nd.

23
00:01:46,155 --> 00:01:48,514
- I heard they had their tour.
- They did.

24
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,555
I... I couldn't make it.

25
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:52,235
Broken arm.

26
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:55,836
A real trooper could lose an arm,
and still report for duty.

27
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:57,277
So what are you, soft?

28
00:01:57,637 --> 00:02:00,797
- What's going on here, gentlemen?
- Just having a little fun.

29
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:04,037
Oh, I've seen your kind of fun, Hotshot.
Stand down.

30
00:02:04,838 --> 00:02:07,799
Come on, Whip.
Air's getting stale around here.

31
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,520
- Hey. What's your name?
- I'm Lucky.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,680
- Jax.
- Thanks, but I can handle myself.

33
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:18,761
Yeah, sure, but a trooper's only as strong
as the trooper beside him.

34
00:02:18,842 --> 00:02:21,242
- We're all in it together, right?
- Right.

35
00:02:21,322 --> 00:02:24,162
And with the training we got,
I feel ready for anything.

36
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,089
Oh!

37
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,689
Man!

38
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:13,413
Don't be nervous. Only thing
between us and them is experience.

39
00:03:13,774 --> 00:03:15,373
It's not like they're Jedi.

40
00:03:22,416 --> 00:03:23,455
Morning, troops.

41
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:26,176
Welcome aboard
the Jedi Cruiser Endurance.

44
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:38,379
And you'll have the chance to serve
right alongside two Jedi Knights.

45
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,979
- Serious? No way!
- That's gonna be awesome!

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,379
Jedi? Yeah!
Can you believe it?

47
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,260
Generals, new orders from General Kenobi
await you in the War Room. Immediately.

48
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:49,301
Another time, then.

49
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,221
Wow!

50
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,262
The other guy's
Anakin Skywalker.

51
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,383
No way!

52
00:03:55,423 --> 00:03:58,422
I heard he's the strongest Jedi.
This is going to be the best!

53
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:04,264
You seem more disappointed
than our cadets.

54
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:08,665
- It's our job to instruct and inspire.
- You just wanted to show off.

55
00:04:08,746 --> 00:04:13,026
Hey, when I show off,
it is instructive, and inspiring.

56
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:14,506
For you, maybe.

57
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,469
Looks easy, doesn't it?
Well, looks can be deceiving.

58
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,150
There's nothing more dangerous
in all of space than a moving target.

59
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,471
- What do you use for targets, sir?
- Malfunctioning droids.

60
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,711
Mechanical skeet, packed with explosives.

61
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:42,912
Now, this is my ship, and my rules.

62
00:04:42,994 --> 00:04:46,514
I do not allow tourists on board.
Only soldiers.

63
00:04:47,075 --> 00:04:49,154
Now, time for target practice.

64
00:04:49,995 --> 00:04:51,554
You, there. Take the gun.

65
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,320
- Not even close. Next!
- But I only...

66
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,361
Oh, no, you're done.
You only get one chance.

67
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,841
I promise you,
the Separatists don't give more. Next!

68
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,764
Near-miss is still a miss, kid.

69
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:41,485
The Sergeant's right.
Training is no match for experience.

70
00:05:41,527 --> 00:05:44,046
And it's the one thing none of you have.

71
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,007
I know that look.

72
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,210
Whoo-hoo!

73
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,450
Yeah!

74
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:07,171
I see why they call you "Lucky. "

75
00:06:07,252 --> 00:06:11,252
But let's see how you are when Seppies
come at you in tri-attack formation.

76
00:06:22,136 --> 00:06:24,535
- Yeah!
- All right, all right, cut the chatter, men.

77
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:27,496
We're due on observation deck 13.
Fall out!

78
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:33,177
Now that's a cadet to watch.

79
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:38,538
Cadet 1151, tell me where this
Jedi Cruiser's main stabilizers are located.

80
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,979
Sir, hull 17, behind the main reactors, sir.

81
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,219
Good. Cadet 1174,

82
00:06:45,341 --> 00:06:48,380
how many engines fail
before auxiliary power kicks in?

83
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:51,461
Sir, three on port and starboard sides, sir!

84
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:03,584
Channel 7 open,
ready to receive Code 5 transmission.

85
00:07:05,345 --> 00:07:07,744
Boba, is that you?
- It is.

86
00:07:07,826 --> 00:07:09,345
I'm sending you the data now.

87
00:07:16,748 --> 00:07:19,147
Received transmission. Boba out.

88
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:24,748
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Uh, communiqué, sir, eyes only.

89
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:27,589
I've been dispatched
to General Windu's quarters.

90
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:32,070
- There's no problem, sir.
- Oh, there's a problem. You're lying.

91
00:07:38,952 --> 00:07:41,392
Admit it. You're lost.

92
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:46,473
Come on, cut the kid a break.
Windu's quarters are that way, shiny.

93
00:07:46,554 --> 00:07:48,593
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

94
00:08:30,043 --> 00:08:34,644
- Eyes on where you're headed, cadet.
- Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

95
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:56,729
Cadet 327, what reaction propels
the main engines of this Jedi Cruiser?

96
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,889
Pulse combines sparking off
the reactor core rods, sir.

97
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,530
Hmm. Excellent.

98
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,451
Sir. General Skywalker
requests your presence on the bridge.

99
00:09:08,532 --> 00:09:10,131
I'll be there shortly.

100
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:16,453
The General requests
your presence immediately, sir.

101
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:20,773
No rest for the weary.
Put these inside my quarters, would you?

102
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,774
Yes, sir.

103
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:41,378
Are you all right? Trooper! Trooper!

104
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,539
This doesn't look like a drill.

105
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:53,420
No time for chatter.
There's been an explosion.

106
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:56,581
Let's show these troops how the Clone
Youth Brigade rises to the challenge.

107
00:09:56,703 --> 00:10:00,622
Line up! Two by! I don't want any heroes.

108
00:10:00,784 --> 00:10:04,063
Our job's to get to the nearest safe room
and let these troops do their job.

109
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,383
Now, move!

110
00:10:07,185 --> 00:10:10,665
- Think it's a Seppie attack?
- Out here? Perfect place for it.

111
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:13,225
You heard the Sergeant!
Secure the loose talk!

112
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:20,147
- Status report, trooper.
- Ship's undamaged, one man down.

113
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,467
General Windu's quarters got hit
but he survived.

114
00:10:23,108 --> 00:10:24,427
Survived?

115
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:35,950
- You're lucky to be alive. And our trooper?
- Dead.

116
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:39,751
- This was no accident.
- Agreed.

117
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:42,671
Keep moving!

118
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,556
Ship's navigation is nearby.

119
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:05,397
Admiral, has the navigation
been damaged?

120
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:09,238
Hobbled, not destroyed.
Systems are repairable.

121
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:13,038
I've ordered shutdown of all engines
until we're fully operational.

122
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,679
We'll hold orbit over Vanqor.

123
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,359
- Any sign of attack ships?
- None, but we'll keep scanning.

124
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,401
Until we get navigation back,
the Endurance is a fat and easy target.

125
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,601
I won't have it. Kilian out.

126
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:30,442
If navigation wasn't the target,
then hitting your quarters was intentional.

127
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:40,844
Watcher, this is Boba. It's a miss.
Repeat, miss. What should I do?

128
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:43,365
Head to the reactor. Blow the core.

129
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:47,086
But the crew!
It isn't about them, just Mace.

130
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,527
If you want Windu dead,
do as I say!

131
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,607
We have a killer on board this ship
and we are locked in dead space.

132
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:58,048
Just like our assassin.

133
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:01,889
We'll form an unbroken line of troopers
and scour the ship from bow to stern,

134
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,130
checking every corridor,
bulkhead and storage unit.

135
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,690
I want him alive.

136
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:24,654
Hey, you there! Come here!

137
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:27,535
I got lost, sir.

138
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:32,576
- Ship's on full lockdown, son.
- Yes, sir, I know, sir. I just...

139
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:36,057
- I'll return to my company.
- Not alone, you won't.

140
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:39,177
Emergency protocol's in effect.

141
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,498
Look, I'm calling a trooper
to escort you out of here.

142
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,618
This is CT-1477, I need an escort
for a cadet back to his group.

143
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:48,259
- Is that a DC-15A?
- Yeah. Here. Keep the safety on.

144
00:12:48,861 --> 00:12:50,980
Copy that, CT-1477.

145
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,820
We're pretty overloaded
with the emergency status,

146
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:55,581
we'll get someone there
as soon as possible.

147
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:56,781
What?

148
00:13:00,983 --> 00:13:02,222
What are you doing?

149
00:13:03,423 --> 00:13:05,263
We're brothers! Don't shoot!

150
00:13:05,664 --> 00:13:08,864
- You're not my brother.
- Don't shoot!

151
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:10,424
Don't worry...

152
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,586
CT-1477, report in.

153
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,387
CT-1477,
why have you broken off transmission?

154
00:13:34,951 --> 00:13:37,310
Our sweep has now covered
over half the ship, Admiral.

155
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,591
Still no sign of the assassin.

156
00:13:39,671 --> 00:13:42,551
The more ground we cover,
the less there is in which to hide.

157
00:14:07,077 --> 00:14:10,318
Huh. More action
than you signed on for, eh, boys?

158
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:12,718
- We're headed for the safe room now, sir.
- Fine, fine.

159
00:14:12,999 --> 00:14:16,278
Although, on second thought,
let's make a drill of it.

160
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,959
Head for the pods.

161
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,839
Escape pods? Things must be bad.

162
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,921
- The escape pods, sir?
- Mmm. I want to see what they're made of.

163
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,440
I'll even time you.

164
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:28,842
It'll all make a fine story
when you return to your base.

165
00:14:28,963 --> 00:14:31,242
This can't be happening.
Get a hold of yourself.

166
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:34,283
Prepare to launch the distress beacon.
We're going down.

167
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,084
Get your men out of here!
There's nothing more you can do.

168
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:44,885
Artoo, prep the fighters,
be ready to take off.

169
00:14:58,088 --> 00:15:00,328
- Lucky! Stay with the group!
- Yes, sir.

170
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,771
- How are we gonna get through this?
- Groups of four, men. Groups of four.

171
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:10,011
Take pods one and two.

172
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,971
Set rendezvous coordinates
with the other pods,

173
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,411
at a safe distance from the cruiser.

174
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,452
See you at rendezvous mark six.

175
00:15:18,093 --> 00:15:20,732
This is the moment, men. Make it yours.

176
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:35,416
The pod's malfunctioned!

177
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:39,217
The main reactor's beyond hope.
You have to abandon ship.

178
00:15:39,298 --> 00:15:43,178
No. You must abandon ship. I'm staying.

179
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,619
- We missed the rendezvous!
- I can't stop it!

180
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,940
I'm staying with the Admiral.
You better evacuate.

181
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:00,101
Admiral, you must abandon ship.

182
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:04,622
- Not a chance.
- But, sir, with respect, that's an order.

183
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:07,743
It may be your command, General,
but it's my ship.

184
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,863
We don't have time
for that kind of sentiment!

185
00:16:09,945 --> 00:16:14,144
It's not sentiment!
An Admiral must go down with his ship.

186
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:17,265
I don't expect you to understand it, Jedi.

187
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,066
We're lost.

188
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:26,347
What happened? Do we still have control?

189
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:30,628
Navigation's shot. Looks like
our pod was damaged in the escape.

190
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:33,509
- Can we steer?
- No.

191
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:37,949
- How about fuel?
- No feed. We're dead weight.

192
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,710
- So what do we do?
- Our jobs.

193
00:16:45,993 --> 00:16:47,592
Get ready to attach the hyperspace rings.

194
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:00,675
Admiral, what's your status?

195
00:17:00,755 --> 00:17:02,995
We're caught
in Vanqor's gravitational pull.

196
00:17:06,437 --> 00:17:09,157
We're going to try to set her down
on the surface.

197
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:15,958
All right. Once you're down, we'll get
the rescue teams to your location.

198
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,638
General Skywalker,
this is Sergeant Crasher.

199
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,759
Yes, Sergeant.

200
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,519
It's the cadets, sir.
I can't raise them on any channel,

201
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:27,721
and their locator beacon's not active.
Theirs is the only pod unaccounted for.

202
00:17:28,202 --> 00:17:31,721
Sounds like our saboteur
may have gotten to the cadets.

203
00:17:32,162 --> 00:17:33,762
We have to find that pod.

204
00:17:39,404 --> 00:17:42,444
- What was that?
- I don't know. A ship, I think.

205
00:17:48,206 --> 00:17:51,046
- Rescue ship?
- It's too early.

206
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:52,846
What, then?

207
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,009
Well, what do we have here?

208
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:12,011
You boys look lost.

209
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:17,372
Congratulations, Boba. Job well done.

210
00:18:18,492 --> 00:18:22,173
- His name's not Boba. He's Lucky.
- "Lucky"?

211
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:25,653
That's a good one.

212
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,934
You're with her?

213
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,655
I wasn't expecting you
to bring friends along.

214
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:34,295
I couldn't help it, Aurra.
What are you going to do with them?

215
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:38,096
- What do you think?
- Let them go?

216
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:41,497
They're living witnesses, honey.

217
00:18:43,699 --> 00:18:45,537
That was never part of the plan!

218
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,379
I just wanted to kill the Jedi
that murdered my father.

219
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,019
Well, that will have to wait.

220
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,900
Grow up! You'll get your revenge in time.

221
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,981
Now get on board.
We have to get out of here.

222
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,141
Or, you can go with your friends,

223
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,742
who I'm going to jettison into the unknown.

224
00:19:04,223 --> 00:19:06,022
That would be poetic.

225
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,943
I'm sorry.

226
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:14,865
Traitor.

227
00:19:22,867 --> 00:19:24,066
Do it!

228
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:27,347
You'll regret this!

229
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:46,071
I can't believe it.
A traitor? He was a traitor?

230
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:48,631
Yes, well,
we can't worry about that right now.

231
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,392
We have to find a way
to contact somebody.

232
00:19:50,993 --> 00:19:53,753
We already tried! This pod is dead!

233
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:56,113
- We only have minimal life support.
- Yeah?

234
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:58,633
Well, whose fault is that? None of us!

235
00:19:59,035 --> 00:20:01,355
That guy you defended left us for dead!

236
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,595
Stow it, Whiplash!
We need to work together.

237
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,675
You're not in charge here!

238
00:20:07,436 --> 00:20:09,676
They have come back to finish us off!

239
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:11,796
No, wait! It's the Jedi!

240
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,118
I found your missing cadets, Crasher.

241
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,519
Nice work, General.
How are they?

242
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:22,399
I can't raise them on the comm channel.

243
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,640
Their pod must have been damaged
in the evacuation.

244
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:27,520
Head to point 038
and you can pick them up.

245
00:20:27,641 --> 00:20:28,680
Right away, sir.

246
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:31,521
Skywalker, have you heard
from Admiral Kilian?

247
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:34,882
No, I lost contact
when they entered the atmosphere.

248
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:43,844
- Jax, I'm sorry. I lost my head. I didn't...
- It's okay, I understand.

249
00:20:44,245 --> 00:20:47,364
I can't believe it was one of us,
someone just like us.

250
00:20:47,765 --> 00:20:52,606
- He's nothing like us!
- Let's hope he is. If he is like us,

251
00:20:53,327 --> 00:20:55,326
he'll realize he's wrong.
