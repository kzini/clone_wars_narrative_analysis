1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,120
As the war
between the Republic

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,910
and the Separatists intensifies,

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,260
many are driven
from their home planets,

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,790
and it is up to Senator Amidala
to secure aid for them.

5
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:31,380
All eyes turn to the Banking Clan
and the planet Scipio.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,050
In an effort to remain independent
from the Republic and the Separatists,

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,840
all operations are divided

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,720
and money transactions
are performed in a neutral zone

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,730
surrounding the main vault.

10
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:46,440
For operations to continue,
there must be no war on Scipio.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,310
However, worry about the stability
of the Banking Clan

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,940
is brewing within the Republic

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,910
as the wellspring of money
may be in jeopardy.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,700
Welcome to Scipio, Senator.

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,330
If you will follow me,

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,450
we will be traveling
into the neutral zone.

17
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,600
I am afraid your guards
will have to wait outside.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,180
Of course.

19
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,320
As Council of Five,
we are honored but surprised

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,410
that you have traveled all this way
for a mere bank transfer.

21
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,320
A transfer that has
not been forthcoming.

22
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,500
By request of the Supreme Chancellor,
I am here to expedite matters.

23
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,750
Of course.

24
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,830
We would merely request that you
meet with our special representative

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,260
who will go over the terms
and conditions of your loan.

26
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,180
Senator Amidala.

27
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,020
Clovis.

28
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,440
You two know one another?

29
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,450
Sir, I was assured

30
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,980
that this transaction would be free
of prejudice and partisan allegiance.

31
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,150
This man is a known Separatist
and traitor to the Republic.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,620
- Padme...
- I can assure you.

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,290
Rush Clovis is our most trusted
and best negotiator.

34
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,410
I am sorry, gentlemen.

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,170
But I insist that this man be removed
from these negotiations.

36
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,460
Until then, we have nothing further
to discuss.

37
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:43,330
Milady no longer requires
your assistance this evening.

38
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,830
Thank you.

39
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,660
Milady, watch out!

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,670
I would stop right there if I were you.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,630
Ah. How did you get a blaster
into the neutral zone?

42
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,170
We're resourceful.

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,260
Now, why are you breaking in
to my quarters?

44
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,720
Padme, you don't understand
what is going on here.

45
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,840
I need your help.

46
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,600
Last time you needed my help,
I ended up poisoned,

47
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,930
and you did nothing.

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,350
That's not true.
You stole data files from me.

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,110
That revealed the location
of a Separatists' droid factory

50
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,820
sponsored by you!

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,570
Look, it's not safe. We can't talk here.

52
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,570
Senator, I really don't think...

53
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,870
It's all right.
I want to hear what he has to say.

54
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,260
The simple fact is the economics
of this war are not adding up.

55
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,970
You're here for a bank transfer,

56
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,980
but I can assure you
there is no money in the bank.

57
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,650
That's absurd.

58
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,730
They were ready
to give me the funds today.

59
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,480
Oh, they will give you
your first installment, yes.

60
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,900
But they're robbing one side
to save the other.

61
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,660
The entire Banking Clan
is on the verge of collapse.

62
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,370
Collapse? Where is the evidence?

63
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,580
In the vault.
The accounts are sealed there,

64
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,830
and no one is allowed to see them
besides the Core Five.

65
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:19,750
Convenient.

66
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,340
Well, now that you're here,
you must put pressure on them.

67
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,720
And do what exactly?

68
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,390
Help me gain access to the vault.

69
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:39,230
You're insane to think
I would ever trust you.

70
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,810
I'm sorry, but I cannot help you.

71
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,820
Take your hands off me!

72
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:52,950
I've risked everything to tell you this.

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,520
Don't you see they're trying to kill me
because of what I know?

74
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,460
Please believe me.
Our past must count for something.

75
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,856
- I can't stay here.

76
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,470
Think about what I ask.

77
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,950
If what you are saying is true,

78
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:40,220
then this information Clovis is offering
is vital to our security.

79
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:45,790
I need you to be very clear
in this matter for the Republic.

80
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,460
Is he telling the truth?

81
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,130
Yes. I'm sure.

82
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,590
Perhaps then, in this scenario,

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,640
it would be best for you
to trust an old friend

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,810
and do what he suggests.

85
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,330
I have decided to accept Clovis
as the representative of this transaction

86
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,290
as long as I can go into the vault

87
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,210
and accompany the funds
throughout the entire process.

88
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:34,340
No outsider
is ever allowed into the vaults.

89
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,470
I come with the authority
of the Supreme Chancellor.

90
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,970
If you have something to hide,

91
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,140
then that is something
we should discuss.

92
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,390
Hide?

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,310
I think considering
last night's attack on the Senator,

94
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,320
it is only fair that we are transparent
and agree to these terms.

95
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,900
What harm will come of it?

96
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,740
The vault will be open
first thing in the morning.

97
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,370
Please make sure
you are here, Senator.

98
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,890
Where exactly are we, Clovis?

99
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,150
This is my personal residence.

100
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,560
A bit remote,
but we'll have more privacy here.

101
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,030
Once I detonate the charge here
at the main power source,

102
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,580
the vault will go
into immediate shutdown.

103
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:50,250
No one will get in or out.

104
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,800
This will give you very little time

105
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,550
before the emergency generator cycles
and takes over.

106
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,220
You'll then use this
to locate the exact files

107
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,390
and download them
from the mainframe.

108
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,480
The vault is one
of the most secure in the galaxy.

109
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,270
But it was designed to keep people out.

110
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,860
Once you're inside,
and the power is down,

111
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,820
there is little they can do.

112
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,990
You make it sound so easy.

113
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,500
If you don't mind, Senator,
I will retire for the night.

114
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,750
Of course, Teckla.

115
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,420
The information we get tomorrow
will go a long way

116
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,460
to expose, perhaps,
the real criminals behind this war.

117
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,260
These are war profiteers.
I've exposed that before.

118
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,840
Nobody cares.

119
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,510
Truth is not on the battlefield.

120
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,020
It's late.

121
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,020
Good night, Clovis.

122
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,430
Clovis, where are you going?

123
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I have some business to attend to.

124
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,650
This was your idea.

125
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,440
I should very much like for you
to await the Senator's return.

126
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,370
If you'll follow me,

127
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,670
the credits for the Republic
are in this section.

128
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,676
- What happened to the lights?

129
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,570
I can't see a thing!

130
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,080
Find out what is going on,
and open the vault immediately.

131
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,290
Power has been cut,
and the security lock has engaged.

132
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,210
It will take some time to switch over.

133
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,030
- Where is the Senator?
- We got separated in the darkness.

134
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,280
I'm here.

135
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,450
No thanks to your security system.

136
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,960
This isn't a vault. It's a tomb.
What is going on?

137
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,170
My deepest apologies, Senator.

138
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,420
It seems I'm witness
to many firsts on Scipio.

139
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,550
Is this an unfortunate incident
or a cover up?

140
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,510
I'm not sure what you mean.

141
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm afraid I'm going to have to report
on your sad state of affairs

142
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,140
to the Chancellor.

143
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,530
Let's see if you got what we needed.

144
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,040
As I said, the vaults are empty.

145
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,960
The Chancellor
must see this immediately.

146
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,390
Senator Amidala,
you are under arrest for espionage.

147
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,640
No, there's been some kind of mistake.

148
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,720
Take her away.

149
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,070
I have powerful friends.
The Chancellor will hear about this.

150
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,380
This way, Master Jedi.

151
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,600
Well, well, well.
What exactly is going on here?

152
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,860
Ani. I'm so glad to see you.

153
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:27,820
Ah! I guess I'm not only useful
for fighting wars after all.

154
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:31,610
- How long have I been in here?
- A few days.

155
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,360
They say Teckla is dead. Is it true?

156
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,870
Yes. She was found shot
at the bombsite.

157
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,330
- By who?
- They don't know.

158
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:43,080
The Muuns say
she sabotaged the power grid.

159
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,210
What exactly is going on here?

160
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,090
You have to get me out of here.

161
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,250
- Clovis is...
- Clovis?

162
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,300
What exactly does Clovis
have to do with this?

163
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,390
I can't explain it here.

164
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:59,970
How could you ever put your trust
in a man like Clovis after what he did?

165
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,100
It's for the Republic, Anakin.

166
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,900
Something is very wrong
with the banks.

167
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,950
Why is it that when Clovis is around,

168
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:10,690
your excuse is always that
you're doing it for the Republic?

169
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,740
Anakin, please.

170
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,410
You know, maybe
I'll just leave you here.

171
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,120
Ani.

172
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,660
You've already been released
into my custody.

173
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,800
You better come with me
before I change my mind.

174
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,720
Anakin, please trust me.

175
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,340
I can't leave without the files
Clovis and I took from the vault.

176
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,720
Where exactly do you suggest we look?

177
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:45,020
The disks may be outside the city
at Clovis' private residence.

178
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,860
Fine. I'll do this for you,
not for Clovis. Artoo.

179
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,480
Have the ship ready in case I need you.

180
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,500
Over there.

181
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,230
Cozy place.

182
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,610
Someone was looking for the
files. They must know Clovis has them.

183
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,636
Well, maybe they found
what they were looking for,

184
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,120
and that's why he's missing.

185
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,070
We can only hope.

186
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,370
Anakin, you're not helping things.

187
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,120
You don't seem to understand
how important these files are.

188
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:51,080
They'll expose a corruption that goes
to the very core of the Banking Clan.

189
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,340
Clovis!

190
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,000
Padme.

191
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,880
I knew you'd come.

192
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,180
You again?

193
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,890
Yes, me again.

194
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,600
All right, lover boy, where's the disk?

195
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,980
I'm not about to hand over
the information to some pilot.

196
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,110
I'm a Jedi Knight who can save your life
if you hand over the files!

197
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,030
So, what's it going to be?
You gonna give us the disk?

198
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,950
Why? So you can leave me stranded
like last time?

199
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,530
Well, that depends on
how well-behaved you are.

200
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,080
Can you both stop bickering
so we can get out of here?

201
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,550
Down!

202
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,890
Thanks.

203
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,970
It wasn't you I wanted to save.

204
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:46,020
Anakin, get us out of here.

205
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,270
Follow me!

206
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,060
Run for it!

207
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,050
Artoo, bring the ship around
and pick us up.

208
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Look out!

209
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,430
Anakin!

210
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,480
Did we lose him?

211
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
I'm all right.

212
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Artoo, hone in on my signal. Artoo?

213
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,680
- Hey, nice catch.

214
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,040
It seems your mission was a success,
bounty hunter.

215
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,050
From this point,
I will deal with them myself.
