1
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,160
<i>A galaxy divided by war.

2
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,250
<i>Peaceful worlds must choose sides
or face the threat of invasion.

3
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:30,340
<i>Republic and Separatist armies vie
for the allegiance of neutral planets.

4
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
<i>Desperate to build a Republic supply base
in the system of Toydaria,

5
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,430
<i>Jedi Master Yoda travels to secret
negotiations on a remote neutral moon.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,270
We are getting no signal
from the Republic, Your Highness.

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,810
I don't see anything.

8
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,040
It is not like the Jedi to be late.

9
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,490
Greetings, King Katuunko.

10
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,990
- Who are you?
- I am only a messenger, Majesty.

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,580
My master wishes to speak with you.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,880
<i>Katuunko, great king of Toydaria,
forgive my intrusion.

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,550
Count Dooku.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,230
<i>I am aware Master Yoda hopes
you will allow the Jedi

15
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,260
<i>to build a Republic base in your system

16
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,890
<i>in exchange for protection, correct?

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,390
Your spies serve you well, Count.

18
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,440
<i>I ask, how can the Jedi protect you

19
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:36,530
<i>if they cannot protect themselves?

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,870
Toydarian Royal Delegation,
this is the Republic Envoy. Please respond.

21
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,370
General, the Toydarians' beacon
is active on the moon,

22
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,250
but all our transmissions
are being jammed.

23
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,370
Hmm.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,420
We caught them by surprise, all right.

25
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,810
We're losing our shields!

26
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,060
Too late it is. Sprung is the trap.

27
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,820
- I must get you to safety, General.
- Retreat you must.

28
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,070
On the moon below is my mission.
There I must go.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
I suppose you and your droid armies
can do better?

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,260
<i>Without a doubt.

31
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,330
<i>I sense you are one
who respects strength, Your Highness.

32
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,300
<i>Our droid armies outnumber
the Republic clones 100 to one.

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,920
Perhaps,

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,180
but I have heard that a single Jedi
equals 100 battle droids.

35
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,970
Quickly, now.
Reach the planet's surface we must.

36
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:52,310
In an escape pod, sir?
The enemy will fire at anything we launch.

37
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,110
Then launch all of them you will. Hmm?

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,700
<i>Master Yoda's powers
have been greatly exaggerated.

39
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:08,290
That remains to be seen, Count.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,130
<i>Indeed. When you decide to join us,
my apprentice will contact me.

41
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,970
Hang on. Almost...

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,400
- What a terrible shot.
- Oh, well, it's my programming.

43
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,250
That was a close one!

44
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,240
General, I think we're out of range.

45
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:49,750
I agree, but entering another trap we are.

46
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,330
- Are you sure?
- A disturbance in the Force there is.

47
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,420
My lord, Master Yoda's warship
has fled the system.

48
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,050
What further evidence do you require
of the Jedi's weakness?

49
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,190
This is King Katuunko. Speak.

50
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,690
<i>Master Yoda would like
to talk with you, sir.

51
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,280
A pleasure it is to hear your voice,
Your Highness.

52
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,900
Master Yoda of the Jedi Council this is.

53
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,780
Master Jedi, I thought perhaps
Count Dooku had frightened you off.

54
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,220
<i>Delayed have I been,
but not too far away am I now.

55
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,460
<i>Unaware I was
Count Dooku was invited to our meeting.

56
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,890
The Count invited himself.

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,210
He assures me that, in this time of war,

58
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,800
his droids can offer my world
greater security than your Jedi.

59
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,100
<i>Hmm. A matter of debate that is.

60
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,810
Your Majesty might prefer
more than words.

61
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:56,440
What do you have in mind?

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,940
If Yoda is indeed
the Jedi warrior you believe he is,

63
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,730
let him prove it.

64
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,900
Allow me to send my best troops
to capture him.

65
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,450
If he escapes, join the Republic.

66
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,920
But should my droids defeat Yoda,
consider an alliance with the Separatists.

67
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,960
I did not request Yoda's presence here
to test him in battle.

68
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,920
<i>Accept the challenge I do, Your Highness.
Arrive by nightfall I will.

69
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:28,930
Master Yoda must be given a fair fight.

70
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,260
My dear King Katuunko,
I would have it no other way.

71
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,650
Beautiful this moon is, hmm?
Amazing the universe is.

72
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,830
There's gotta be a full battalion in there.
Probably packing armor, too.

73
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,000
We'll have something for them.

74
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,980
I am deploying my forces, Master.

75
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,900
<i>Yoda has made a grave mistake
straying this far from Coruscant.

76
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,980
I will see the Jedi gets his "fair fight."

77
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,650
Carry only what you need.
Too much weight, slow you down it will.

78
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,160
Destroy Ventress your weapons will not.

79
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,030
Come, come, Lieutenant. Hurry we must.

80
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,200
Sir, the rendezvous point is that way.

81
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,160
As is our enemy.

82
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,880
To reach our goal,
a straight path we will not follow.

83
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,170
Let's move it, boys!

84
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,540
Find Master Yoda.

85
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,420
Uh... What does he look like?

86
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,260
He'll be the small, shriveled green one

87
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,010
with the lightsaber!

88
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,520
Small, huh? Don't worry, Supreme Leader,
we'll take care of him.

89
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,450
I think I see them.
They're hiding deep in the trees.

90
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,410
Fire on Sector 11!

91
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,800
At ease be, my friends.
Within range we are not.

92
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,770
Uh... Hold it. Hold it.

93
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:45,060
I said hold it! Wait!
That's far enough! I mean it!

94
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,230
Stop! I said stop!

95
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,820
- We're too big to fit in there.
- No, we're not. Watch this.

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,410
- You were right.
- Next time, listen to orders!

97
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,290
Those tanks are too big to follow.

98
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,630
See? See? Size is not everything, hmm?

99
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,380
Smaller in number are we,
but larger in mind.

100
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,720
Do you have any idea
what the General is talking about?

101
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,100
How should I know?
There's no figuring a Jedi Master.

102
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,310
Infantry, advance!

103
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,400
Go get them, boys!

104
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,950
Sir, there are two patrols
coming in on foot.

105
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,320
Now is the time
to face the enemy, Lieutenant.

106
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,780
Ambush them we will.

107
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,580
- We'll flank them from the south.
- Right. Let's move!

108
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,430
What was that?

109
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:00,970
Blast him!

110
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,810
Look! A little green life form!

111
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,110
You buckethead! That's the Jedi!

112
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,820
He is a little one! Blast him!

113
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,040
Split up by squad and spread out!

114
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,160
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

115
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,170
Okay, clankers, suck laser!

116
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,720
- Where's the General?
- I don't know. We got separated.

117
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,850
Clankers!

118
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,850
Fall back!
There are too many of them!

119
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,990
He's around here somewhere.

120
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,530
Hey! Get off of me!

121
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,700
Don't move.

122
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,550
<i>The Jedi destroyed our advance troops.

123
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,220
Ha! Master Yoda
is living up to my expectations.

124
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:29,440
Commander,
have you pinpointed the Jedi's location?

125
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,190
<i>Affirmative.
The clones gave away their position.

126
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,610
<i>Our heavy troops are moving
to engage them now.

127
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,450
I hope the General reaches
the rendezvous point.

128
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,790
We're sure buying him time.

129
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,260
- Lieutenant, can you walk?
- I think I'm okay.

130
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,930
Die, Republic dogs.

131
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,440
What are we gonna do, sir?

132
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,570
Hmm.

133
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:29,290
- What's the General doing?
- Keep blasting!

134
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,250
Hey, what's going on?

135
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:46,430
Get out of the way! All of you!
I'm having a serious malfunction.

136
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,350
Don't shoot!

137
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,810
I'm on your side!

138
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,870
You found us just in time, sir.

139
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,190
Left behind no one will be.

140
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,280
Rollies, inbound!

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,170
Retreat! Cover you I will.

142
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,390
<i>Republic troops are injured. The
Jedi is in full retreat, Supreme Leader.

143
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,470
Good. Pursue them without delay.

144
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,570
The contest is not over yet.

145
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,900
Master Yoda! I hear you're having trouble
with the Droid Army.

146
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,490
<i>Trouble? I know nothing of this trouble.

147
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,030
<i>Look forward to our meeting soon I do.

148
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,830
The Jedi won't elude me for long.

149
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:04,710
Are you sure we should go in there,
General? There's no way out.

150
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,430
Now rest we must.

151
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,410
We're low on ammo, sir.

152
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,410
Only two grenades,
and one rocket for the launcher.

153
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,290
Against a battalion?
Forget it. We've lost.

154
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,050
So certain of defeat are you?

155
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,590
With respect, General,
maybe you should go on.

156
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,090
Let us slow them down.

157
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,100
All around us
is that which we need to prevail. Yes.

158
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Come. Sit. Your helmets, remove them.
Your faces I wish to see.

159
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,500
There's not much to look at here, sir.
We all share the same face.

160
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,620
Deceive you eyes can.

161
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,750
In the Force,
very different each one of you are.

162
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,580
Rys, always focused on the enemy are you.

163
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,960
For inspiration,
look to yourself and those beside you.

164
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:36,010
Jjeck, concerned about weapons you are.
Weapons do not win battles.

165
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,480
Your mind, powerful it is.
Outthink the droids you can.

166
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,820
Thire,
rush not into fights. Long is the war.

167
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,410
Only by surviving it will you prevail. Yes.

168
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:00,250
Clones you may be,
but the Force resides in all life forms.

169
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:03,170
Use it you can to quiet your mind.

170
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,850
Tanks. Is that the best
they can throw at us?

171
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,020
Yeah, but I've only got one shot left.

172
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,390
Greet them I will.

173
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,020
General, you don't plan to take
that whole column by yourself?

174
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,040
Have you three I do.
Outnumbered are they.

175
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,530
Know the time to help me you will.

176
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,710
It's the Jedi! Block his escape!

177
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,090
Prepare to fire!

178
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,320
<i>Supreme Leader, we've found the Jedi.

179
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,400
- Excellent. Where is he?
<i>- He's just sitting here in front of our tanks.

180
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,070
Shoot him! Shoot him now!

181
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,650
Quickly! Ready, aim, fire!

182
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,780
Fire!

183
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,670
He's going under the tank!

184
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,340
Oh, no!

185
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,590
Run for it!

186
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,930
But I just got promoted!

187
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,490
It doesn't look like
the General needs help to me.

188
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,160
We've got him in our sights!

189
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:15,470
That's a lot of smoke for a surrender.

190
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,010
Report. What's going on over there?
224, come in!

191
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,180
Where is 224?

192
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,850
<i>Destroyed, Supreme Leader.
The Jedi has overrun our position and...

193
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,150
I think perhaps all those stories
about the Jedi are true.

194
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,330
The fight isn't over yet, Majesty.

195
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,540
The General's cutting them up.

196
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,010
We got trouble.
The clankers sent reinforcements.

197
00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:01,260
The General's too busy with that tank.
He won't see them coming.

198
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,680
I think I know how to deal with them.

199
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,710
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

200
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,960
- Great shot, sir!
- That's giving it to the clankers!

201
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,050
Hmm.

202
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,390
Learned something today,
have you, Lieutenant, hmm?

203
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,890
I think we all did, General.

204
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,940
Come, behind schedule are we.
Not polite to be late.

205
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,330
You were right, Count Dooku.
One Jedi is not worth 100 battle droids.

206
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,930
More like 1,000!

207
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,130
I'm sorry,
but I will be joining the Republic.

208
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,590
<i>I urge you to reconsider, wise king.

209
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:21,670
<i>I promise you won't regret it.

210
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,510
Your agent also promised me
Yoda would get a fair fight.

211
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,350
I will not deal with those
who break their words.

212
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:30,770
<i>So be it.

213
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,100
<i>Perhaps our negotiations
will more fruitful with your successor.

214
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,270
<i>Ventress! Kill him!

215
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,800
Jedi Master Yoda.
I am very pleased to meet you at last.

216
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,550
Share the feeling I do, King Katuunko.

217
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,310
Failed you Ventress has, Count.

218
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,730
I don't fear you, Jedi.

219
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,850
Strong you are with the dark side,
young one,

220
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,230
but not that strong.

221
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,320
Still much to learn you have.

222
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,160
Surrender you should.

223
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,050
Hmm.

224
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,890
In the end, cowards are those
who follow the dark side.

225
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,810
<i>It's a pity I wasn't there in person,
my old master.

226
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,480
A pity indeed, my fallen apprentice.

227
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,820
Perhaps now begin negotiations we can.

228
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,250
That is not necessary, my friend.
You have my faith.

229
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,950
Toydaria would be honored
to host a Republic base.

230
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,250
My people are at your service.

231
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:21,380
Your Majesty, fail you we will not.
