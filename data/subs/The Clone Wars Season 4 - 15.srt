1
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,370
<i>A terrorist threat!</i>

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:22,370
<i>Moralo Eval,
mastermind of a Separatist plot</i>

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,590
<i>to kidnap Chancellor Palpatine,
has been captured by Republic forces!</i>

4
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,290
<i>But even with the criminal behind bars,</i>

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>rumors swirl in
the underworld of Coruscant</i>

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,170
<i>that Moralo's plot has already
been set in motion...</i>

7
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,090
<i>With precious time running out,
the Jedi Council hatches their own plot</i>

8
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,350
<i>to keep the Chancellor safe.</i>

9
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,600
So what's the big rush?

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,980
The Jedi Council has called
an emergency meeting.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,360
I can see it now.

12
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,650
Another long, boring debate.

13
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,330
Would you rather they call you in
to train younglings?

14
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,330
Are you crazy?

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,840
Any idea where that shot came from?

16
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,260
A sniper. I see him up there!

17
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,230
All right, here's the plan.

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,010
Anakin, you flank him on the right.

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,860
Ahsoka, you cover the lower streets.

20
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,680
I'm going after him.

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
I lost him!

22
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,760
<i>Obi-Wan, do you have anything?</i>

23
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,900
- Obi-Wan!
- I got him, go!

24
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,760
How is he?

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan.

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,900
Obi-Wan!

27
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm worried about Anakin.

28
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,050
He hasn't said a word since it happened.

29
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
Wow.

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,580
I want to check his midi-chlorian count.

31
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,830
What's your pleasure?

32
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,120
Shot of your finest.

33
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,920
So what's the big deal?

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,130
I'm celebrating.

35
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,400
The death of a Jedi.

36
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,850
I killed Obi-Wan Kenobi!

37
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,850
Having second thoughts, Master Yoda?

38
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:19,450
Hmm, heading down a dark path, we are.

39
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,780
We talked about this.

40
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,570
Killing a Jedi was the best move we had.

41
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,820
Hmm.

42
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,100
So, how was my funeral?

43
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,090
A better performance than you,
your corpse gave.

44
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,800
Whatever do you mean?

45
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,470
I fell from the top of a building.

46
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:48,300
I could have killed myself.

47
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,560
Survived worse, you have.

48
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,930
Young Skywalker knows this.

49
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,180
I took the vitals suppressor as instructed.

50
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,560
I was dead to the world
when Anakin moved my body.

51
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:00,690
There's no way he could know I was alive.

52
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,360
Not know.

53
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,740
But sense, he will,
that something is not right.

54
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:08,700
Keeping Anakin on the outside was critical.

55
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,530
Everyone knows how close we are.

56
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:13,120
It was his reaction that sold the sniper.

57
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,330
I'm sure of it.

58
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,260
What's done is done.

59
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,550
We need to get
your transformation underway.

60
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,040
Well, time for a shave!

61
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,550
Tell me about my target.

62
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,010
His name is Moralo Eval.

63
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,760
Works directly for Count Dooku.

64
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,720
Rumor is their plot will be hatched
in three revolutions

65
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,440
at the festival on Naboo.

66
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,110
We tried to make a deal with Moralo
for more details, but he was uncooperative.

67
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,910
Any details that might help me gain
his trust while in prison?

68
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,740
Eval killed his mother
when he was only a boy.

69
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,780
Told the authorities he did it
because he was bored.

70
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,620
Hmm, I'll try not to bore him.

71
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,910
Not a game is this, Obi-Wan.

72
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,290
The risks, great they are.

73
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,750
Yes, and so are the rewards.

74
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,670
Besides preventing Eval
from abducting the Chancellor,

75
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,050
he could lead us to Grievous,
and possibly Dooku himself.

76
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,920
Facial transformation program loaded.

77
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,800
I take it there's no way to have
the Chancellor pull out of the festival?

78
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,150
No. See it as a sign of weakness, he would.

79
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,650
Sign of weakness.
Wouldn't want that.

80
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Transformation initiated.

81
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,790
This cantina is a bust.

82
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,340
Do you want to go to the next one?

83
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,130
Rako Hardeen?

84
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,630
Who wants to know?

85
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,880
Your employer has your payment.

86
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,730
Please follow me.

87
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,720
Round for the house!

88
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,390
Yes! Oh, yeah!

89
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,650
This way.

90
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,040
Inside if you please.

91
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,410
Well done, Mr. Hardeen.

92
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,330
You did precisely the job we hired you for.

93
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,910
We have your credits right here.

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,910
But first we need one more thing...

95
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,840
Your clothes.

96
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,380
What the...

97
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,560
I still don't understand.

98
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:47,060
Did Master Yoda say how they found
the sniper?

99
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,230
Who cares.

100
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
All that matters is they did.

101
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,750
So I took off in my speeder,
and then I got a ride here. That's it.

102
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,460
Keep talking. Into this.

103
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,920
This is stupid!

104
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,080
Confessing to a murder I didn't even do!

105
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,090
Oh, but you did...

106
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,880
For all intents and purposes,
Obi-Wan Kenobi is dead.

107
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,600
And that certainly was your intention.

108
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,930
How do I look?

109
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,350
Like a criminal.

110
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,850
Should buy you all the credibility
you need in prison.

111
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,270
Look, I don't know what you guys
are up to, but...

112
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,640
Do we have enough recording?

113
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,150
I believe so.

114
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,770
Which means you can go to sleep now.

115
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,620
So how does this vocal emulator work?

116
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,080
Well, you swallow it.

117
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,470
I was afraid you'd say that.

118
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,340
What an odd sensation.

119
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,680
It will take some getting used to.

120
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,550
That's a luxury you don't have.

121
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,060
I hope this works.

122
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:17,240
Where is Rako Hardeen?

123
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,160
Back room.

124
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,420
Is he dead?

125
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,130
He's about to be.

126
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,050
A Jedi? I already killed a Jedi today.

127
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,640
Let me sleep.

128
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,180
He's not dead. He's drunk.

129
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,720
Get up, you filth!

130
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,190
If it was up to me I would kill you
right here!

131
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,940
But lucky for you, the man you
murdered would rather see you rot in jail.

132
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,830
Now, let's go, you coward,
before I change my mind.

133
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,210
You should be expecting this scum.

134
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,300
Yes, sir.

135
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,960
Let me know if he's any trouble.

136
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,010
I'd be happy to straighten him out.

137
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,080
That's him!

138
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,750
Kenobi's killer!

139
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,330
Rako Hardeen.

140
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,290
He doesn't look so tough.

141
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,090
He killed a Jedi.

142
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,640
That's him? That's the Jedi killer?

143
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,270
He doesn't look so tough.

144
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,690
You don't look so tough to me.

145
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,820
This food tastes terrible.

146
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,950
Maybe you'd taste better.

147
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,080
Hey, what's going on down there?

148
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,290
Sorry, just playing with my food.

149
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,590
You're crazy!

150
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,990
Rako Hardeen.

151
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,240
Your reputation precedes you.

152
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,780
I'm curious, when you killed that Jedi,

153
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,030
was it for money or revenge?

154
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:07,280
I don't know. Guess I was bored.

155
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,410
Try the sauce.

156
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,670
It makes that slop almost tolerable.

157
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,710
I'll be seeing you, Mr. Hardeen.

158
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,360
Here you go, Hardeen. Home, sweet home.

159
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,530
What a coincidence.

160
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,530
No coincidence.

161
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,530
I am Moralo Eval,

162
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,700
and I have great influence here.

163
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,210
What do you want from me?

164
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,540
A man like you...

165
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,040
There's bigger game than Jedi,

166
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,850
if you've got the guts.

167
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,550
I'm listening.

168
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,800
It's a brilliant plan if I do say so.

169
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:12,560
And it involves the Chancellor.

170
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,520
If I'm breaking out
this goon along with us,

171
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,400
it'll cost you.

172
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,060
Double my rate.

173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,240
Rako Hardeen, meet Cad Bane.

174
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,450
Who you calling a goon?

175
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,910
Any imbecile can kill a Jedi
with a lousy sniper blast.

176
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,910
You want my respect?

177
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,420
You do it face-to-face.

178
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,750
Who said I want your respect?

179
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,180
Make that triple my rate.

180
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,590
Oh, what a shame.

181
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,470
Seems this cell isn't big enough for
the three of us.

182
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,770
Guard!

183
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,820
It's been a pleasure chatting
with you, Hardeen.

184
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,780
But you will forget everything you
heard in here,

185
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,610
or Moralo Eval will have you slaughtered.

186
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:30,730
We were just leaving.

187
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,690
<i>This is Ben.</i>

188
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,710
<i>I found the transmitter,
but I shall have to make this short.</i>

189
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:54,280
<i>We have a problem.</i>

190
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,580
I made contact with Eval.

191
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,620
He nearly divulged his kidnap plot,
but Cad Bane stopped him.

192
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,380
Cad Bane? We had no intel they were
in league together.

193
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,920
<i>It appears Eval's hired Bane
to break him out of prison,</i>

194
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,550
<i>and the way they were talking,
it's imminent.</i>

195
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,970
Foolish we were, to believe Bane's
capture was without purpose.

196
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,180
<i>Yes. Yes, but we can make
this work for us.</i>

197
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:21,480
<i>If they do try to escape,
I won't let them out of my sight.</i>

198
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,690
<i>No doubt he shall lead us
to some answers about the plot</i>

199
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,360
<i>and possibly to his superiors.</i>

200
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,860
Good idea, Obi-Wan.

201
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,070
Just don't blow your cover.

202
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,460
It could take a while
to extract you from prison.

203
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,530
Not to worry.

204
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,870
I'm starting to enjoy playing the villain.

205
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,030
Gotta go!

206
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,000
Hey, Hardeen!

207
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,840
You owe me something.

208
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,220
Oh, do I?

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,310
You don't even remember me?

210
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,220
That's very insulting.

211
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,600
Look, kid, I don't want any trouble.

212
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,900
You stole a bounty from me,
and I want an apology!

213
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,400
Kill him, Hardeen, like the Jedi!

214
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,030
What's wrong, Hardeen?
Lose your spine?

215
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,070
- You don't want to do this.
- Kill him!

216
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,280
Oh, yes, I do.

217
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,250
I warned you.

218
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,066
All right, all right, that's it!

219
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,250
Fight's over!

220
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,880
No, it ain't!

221
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:40,180
You got a problem with Boba,
you got a problem with me!

222
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,600
All right, that's enough, big fella!

223
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,900
- Fight!
- Let's get them!

224
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,940
Let's get them!

225
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,990
Riot! Get the guards!

226
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,320
Get 'em! Yeah!

227
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,960
We need reinforcements in here. Now!

228
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,990
Kill the guards!

229
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,910
Riot! Riot!

230
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,620
What do we do?

231
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,710
Part of my plan.

232
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,710
Paid off the kid to create a diversion.

233
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,970
Let's go.

234
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:36,490
<i>Facility on lockdown. Facility on lockdown.</i>

235
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,570
<i>Facility on lockdown.</i>

236
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,740
Turn your weapons off stun!

237
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,530
Kill the prisoners if you have to!

238
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,660
Hey, wait for me.

239
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,090
No one invited you.

240
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,170
He killed a Jedi. He could be helpful.

241
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,380
Fine. We're wasting time.

242
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,520
Uh, I'm telling you,
it's gonna be a long night.

243
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,700
This is our way out of here.

244
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,030
The morgue? This is your brilliant plan?

245
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,990
Not the first time I've broken out
of this stink hole.

246
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,300
The lock has changed.

247
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,670
Your plan has failed.

248
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Shut up! Let me think.

249
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,220
I can get us inside.
I'll re-wire the access port on this door.

250
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,810
It'll take some time,
so warn me if anyone comes.

251
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,560
Make it quick.

252
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
We're in!

253
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:10,080
All the riot casualties are sent
to the crematorium.

254
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,500
From there it's an easy escape.

255
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,920
Another night, another riot.

256
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,500
The guards are coming back.

257
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,880
You said it, partner.

258
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,300
I'll take blasting clankers any day
over this.

259
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,150
Yeah, me too, give me droids over
this prison scum.

260
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:28,690
After what just happened up there,
we'll need more room in here.

261
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,850
You can say that again.

262
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,070
Here, I'll send these
to the cremation center.

263
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,950
Hey, wait, it looks like a couple
of them are showing vital signs.

264
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,750
All right, I'll check it out.

265
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,810
What's the matter with you?

266
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,520
My blaster jammed.

267
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,610
Let's go!

268
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,030
Soon as we're off Coruscant, we're safe.

269
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,540
That's for hesitating during the escape.

270
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,420
If it wasn't for me,
we'd still be stuck in there.

271
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,430
Yeah, funny how that worked out.

272
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,810
Hey, my ship! Come back here!

273
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,400
You did well in there, Hardeen.

274
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,570
Maybe there's a place for you
in my plans after all.

275
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,070
I'm listening.
