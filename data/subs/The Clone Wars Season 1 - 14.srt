1
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,680
<i>Republic forces in retreat!</i>

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>While rescuing General Aayla Secura
from certain defeat,</i>

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
<i>Anakin Skywalker
has been seriously injured.</i>

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,440
<i>After a narrow escape,
our heroes crash-landed</i>

5
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,520
<i>on the remote world of Maridun.</i>

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,080
<i>Stranded, and with no way
to contact the Republic,</i>

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,520
<i>the Jedi receive medical aid
from the peaceful Lurmen colonists.</i>

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>But even on this tiny planet,
the war threatens to follow the Jedi.</i>

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,760
Commander Bly, we've got company.

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,240
- Friendlies?
- Negative, sir.

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,400
A droid ship...

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,520
<i>coming straight our way.</i>

13
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,480
Acknowledged.
Get back here.

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,520
- General?
- Yes, Commander?

15
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,640
We've got a Separatist ship
incoming.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,520
This is neutral space.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,800
It won't be neutral for long,
not if the Separatists have their way.

18
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,280
- Help me up.
- Don't struggle.

19
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,440
I'm sorry,
but you're still too injured to move.

20
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,240
What menace have you brought
to our village now, Jedi?

21
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,600
Father, you can't blame them.

22
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,560
He's right. The Separatists
don't even know we're here.

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,960
And they can't know.
We've got to hide.

24
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,360
Your presence here endangers us.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,600
You must leave
before your enemies find you.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,760
But you'll need our help.
You can't fight them alone.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,040
We will not fight them at all.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,120
We would rather die
than to kill others.

29
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,200
You're going to surrender?

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,840
- But how can you--
- Ahsoka, stop.

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,000
If the Lurmen want to remain neutral,
we won't force them into war.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,080
See to it that they leave.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,800
I must see
what our new visitors want.

34
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,080
Take it easy, sir.
We'll assist you.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
I am General Lok Durd

36
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,400
of the Separatist alliance.

37
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,480
I am Tee Watt Kaa,
leader of this colony.

38
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,440
- What do you--
- You are now under the protection

39
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,360
of the Separatist alliance.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,440
I congratulate you

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,200
on your good fortune.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Thank you, but we enjoyed good fortune
well before your arrival.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
We are a peaceful people, General.

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
I do not condone your presence here.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,080
Then stand aside.

46
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,360
I would like to inspect
my new colony.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
Ransack this dung heap.

48
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,280
Why are they tearing apart
our homes?

49
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
We've done nothing to them!

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,360
Violence...

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,760
that's what those droids
are programmed for.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,440
Can't we do anything?

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
No, and if we are discovered,
all of the Lurmen will be slaughtered.

54
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,560
We'll be okay
if we make it to the tall grasses.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
There is no evidence of any weapons
or Republic contraband, General.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,600
In the future, we may conduct
more periodic searches

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,400
like this one
in order to maintain security.

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
Because we are
such an obvious threat to you.

59
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,000
We'll offer no resistance.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,240
Your species is smarter
than you appear.

61
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,240
Father, are you okay?

62
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,120
At least the Jedi escaped.

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,440
Yes, but they nearly brought harm
to our entire village.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
But now, thanks to you,

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,160
we're safe to grovel before every
petty tyrant who enters our system.

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
You would mock our very way of life?

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,680
I have just ensured
we will have peace.

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,600
Yes, but for the moment,
and at what price?

69
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,760
Are you not concerned
about the Jedi at all?

70
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,000
I have no quarrel with the Jedi,

71
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,200
but we cannot help them
without being drawn into their war.

72
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
Tub, track the Jedi.

73
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,160
Follow them
and make sure they get off world.

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,040
You know, I can't figure those villagers
not wanting to fight.

75
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
No pride, I guess.

76
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,400
I call it no courage.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
Sometimes it takes courage to stick
to one's beliefs, young Padawan,

78
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,440
as any Jedi well knows.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,640
We need to find a ship,

80
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,840
and I think the only one around here
belongs to the Separatists.

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,520
We know they have a landing ship.
They might have a shuttle.

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,480
Sir, you talking about stealing
from one of the clankers?

83
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,600
- Count me in.
- We need to find them first.

84
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,160
I think we just did.

85
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,840
Blast it!

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
Jam its signal!

87
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,760
After it!

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,120
I'm fine. Just go!

89
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,800
- Which way did it go?
- This way. Hurry!

90
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
We can't catch it
if it gets out in the open.

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,420
- I wonder where it was headed.
- Maybe we can see them from up there.

92
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
I hope you're feeling better,
Master,

93
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,880
'cause look what we found.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,960
I'm getting stronger
all the time, Snips.

95
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,600
But I'm not sure
I'm ready for that.

96
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,200
That shuttle is
our ticket off this rock.

97
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,800
It's not gonna be easy, sir.

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,120
There don't seem to be any flaws
in their security line.

99
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,520
Apparently,
the Separatists have a new toy.

100
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,920
- See if you can get a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,840
I'll go with you, Commander.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,480
Is the defoliator capsule ready?

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,440
Today is a grand day
for the Separatist cause.

104
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,480
We test a new weapon

105
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,800
of my own design

106
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,240
which is capable
of catastrophic destruction.

107
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,480
A weapon which will destroy
organic matter

108
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,440
but leave machines

109
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,000
unharmed.

110
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,240
But first,

111
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
we need two volunteers.

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
The volunteers are...

113
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,600
...you and you.

114
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,240
- Me?
- Me?

115
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
Go to that ridge.

116
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,800
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

117
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Stay down, boys.

118
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,540
Count Dooku,

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,680
I have located a world
in which we can test my...

120
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,560
Excuse me.

121
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,600
...our new weapon.

122
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,080
<i>I hope it turns out
to be worth the expense.</i>

123
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
<i>You may proceed.</i>

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,480
Yes, my Lord.
Ready?

125
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Roger, roger.

126
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:23,920
Aim.

127
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,920
Fire!

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,440
Should we take cover?

129
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,680
No, idiot.
That is not even gonna hit us.

130
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,640
That's some toy.

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,800
It took out every living thing.

132
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,080
As you can see,

133
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,600
the landscape has been destroyed,

134
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,760
and the droids are undamaged.

135
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,480
<i>Impressive.</i>

136
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,560
<i>But now, we need to know</i>

137
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,360
<i>how effective
this weapon will be against...</i>

138
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,840
<i>living creatures.</i>

139
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,520
Of course.

140
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,800
I specifically chose this planet
because it is inhabited.

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,720
The colonists will make
excellent test subjects.

142
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,440
<i>Proceed, then.</i>

143
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,160
<i>I eagerly await the results.</i>

144
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,400
Prepare to move out!

145
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,240
Where are they off to now?

146
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,840
They must be going back
to the Lurmen village.

147
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,880
There's nothing else
in that direction.

148
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,200
Those villagers
won't stand a chance.

149
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,560
First we'll take out
the droids' communication station.

150
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,880
After we get a shuttle,
we'll go back and help them.

151
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,440
But Tee Watt Kaa said
he doesn't need our help.

152
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,440
There's a difference
between pulling innocents into a war

153
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,160
and leaving them to extinction.

154
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,440
Tell Wag Too
that the Separatists are returning.

155
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
Hey, what was that?

156
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,840
Get to the door.
I'll handle the droids.

157
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,560
Check the exterior.

158
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,400
We cannot have any surprises
for the General.

159
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,080
4724, how does the west end
check out?

160
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,240
What the...?

161
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,880
The Separatists are on the march.
They're returning to our village.

162
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,000
They did not attack us before.

163
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,320
There's no reason to think
they will this time.

164
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,280
Father, they wouldn't be
coming back here

165
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,480
unless they intended to do us harm.
This is war!

166
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,160
But not our war.

167
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,360
We've done nothing to provoke them,

168
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,280
and we will not.
That is their way.

169
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
So we will just lay down
and be slaughtered?

170
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,200
Father, even if we don't fight
the Separatists,

171
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,880
we must defend ourselves!

172
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,920
Mounting a defense
is still engaging in battle.

173
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,400
If we sacrifice our beliefs,
we're no better than they are.

174
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,480
Our philosophy has helped us
to survive for generations,

175
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,480
and we will not change
our morals now or ever.

176
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,320
- Shield generators, sir.
- Let's take 'em with us.

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,040
Everyone,
please, please listen.

178
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,080
The Separatists will be here
in moments.

179
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,320
What are you doing here?
I told you not to return.

180
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,760
I'm afraid the Separatists don't care
whether you're in the war or not.

181
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,080
We need to get you to safety
before they arrive.

182
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,240
We will not abandon our homes.

183
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,200
But they've got a new weapon.
It'll burn this place to a crisp.

184
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,880
Is this what all of you really want?

185
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,120
If it is our destiny to be destroyed
in your war,

186
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,800
so be it.

187
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,520
Droids inbound.
We've got eight minutes tops.

188
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,040
Come on, guys. Let's get
these shield generators in place!

189
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,640
When Count Dooku sees
how successful

190
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,120
my weapon is
against civilian targets,

191
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,520
I will no doubt be promoted
to a more...

192
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,840
...substantial position
within the alliance.

193
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,440
Right.

194
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,320
Well, the villagers appear
to have put some pods together

195
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,960
- in a barrier around the village.
- Pods?

196
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,440
How quaint.

197
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,760
Jedi?

198
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,360
What are they doing out here?
Halt!

199
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Pray stop what you're doing.

200
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,680
Stop building that wall.

201
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,080
- I did not ask you to defend us.
- This battle is inevitable.

202
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,720
You can stand by your beliefs,
but let us stand by ours.

203
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,960
Thank you
for what you're trying to do.

204
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,080
I'm sorry, but I cannot help.
My father is very...

205
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,120
...strong willed and set in tradition.

206
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,040
Many others agree with me,

207
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,360
but we were raised
under a very strict code.

208
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,080
We must respect it,
even if we don't agree.

209
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,480
- They're holding position.
- They're not going to charge us,

210
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,880
not if they can hit us
from long range first.

211
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,120
But if we can withstand that weapon,
we'll draw them in.

212
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
Prepare to fire!

213
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,280
Good-bye, Jedi.

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,760
Fire!

215
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,680
Incoming!

216
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
Power the shields!

217
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,240
Now they'll have to get their hands
dirty and meet us face-to-face.

218
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,920
Squad one, prepare to charge.

219
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,480
Prepare to charge.

220
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,640
Charge!

221
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,040
That's a lot of clankers.

222
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,480
We got to stop them
before they get through that shield.

223
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,480
Five, four,

224
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,920
three,

225
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,920
two,

226
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,120
one,

227
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,680
zero.

228
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,520
Sir, the first squad
has been destroyed.

229
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
Squad two and three, attack!

230
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,760
- That wasn't so tough.
- That was just the first wave.

231
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
Snips, get back to the village!

232
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,480
I'll take care of the new weapon.

233
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,240
That's it. We have to retreat!

234
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,160
Take cover.
They've breached the shield!

235
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,960
They're taking out
the shield generators.

236
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,240
We have to do something.

237
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,880
Their shield is down.
Launch another shell.

238
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,720
Sir, there's a Jedi
heading right for us.

239
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,440
Then blast him, you idiot!

240
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
No survivors.

241
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,480
Wag Too, what are you doing?

242
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,040
- We're going to help.
- I forbid this.

243
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,800
What more would you have them do

244
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,880
before we are allowed
to defend ourselves?

245
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,840
- But--
- We have to do this.

246
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,880
Help!

247
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,760
I'll be defoliated!

248
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,800
There goes my promotion.

249
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,320
The weapon has been disabled.

250
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,000
Copy that, General.

251
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
- Thank you, Wag Too.
- Thank you.

252
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Our village would certainly
have been destroyed

253
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,280
without your protection.
Father,

254
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,520
I was just offering the Jedi
our thanks.

255
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,520
Perhaps we do owe you thanks.

256
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,480
But I still wonder,

257
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,560
at what cost?
