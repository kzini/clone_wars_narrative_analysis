1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,580
A flaw in the plan!

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,660
While in the middle of a heated battle,

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,910
Clone Trooper Tup lost his senses
and killed a Jedi general.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,330
Seeming to have
no awareness of his actions,

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:31,340
Tup's health
began to deteriorate rapidly.

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,880
Fearing the illness was
linked to a Separatist plot,

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,470
Anakin Skywalker has dispatched
Captain Rex and ARC Trooper 5555

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,470
to escort Tup back
to the cloning facilities on Kamino

9
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,720
for an intensive evaluation.

10
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,840
You will have to say goodbye
to your friend now.

11
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,930
Yes, Doctor.

12
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,430
General Shaak Ti.

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,940
Captain Rex.

14
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
Fives. Am I correct?

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,940
Yes, General.

16
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,940
You've served with Tup?

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,060
Yes.

18
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,400
You must come with me.

19
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,080
With... With all due respect, General,

20
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't just abandon him now.

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,450
You must let the doctors do their work.

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,260
Do not be afraid.
Your friend is in quite capable hands.

23
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,370
Dr. Nala Se is
the Chief Medical Scientist on Kamino.

24
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,750
She was one of the primary engineers
of all the clones.

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,170
Now, we must take care of you.

26
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,970
Me? There's nothing
wrong with me, General.

27
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,550
I'm perfectly fine.

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,400
We can't be sure of that
until we've completed a full exam.

29
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,890
If a virus was
the cause of Tup's breakdown,

30
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,150
you have more than likely
been exposed to the contagion.

31
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,400
You haven't entered
the advanced stages yet, as Tup has,

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,020
but any information
we can gather from you

33
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,360
could help to find a cure for Tup.

34
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,610
All right, General,
if it'll help Tup.

35
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,380
Captain Rex, General Skywalker has
ordered you back to the war zone.

36
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,580
You are to leave immediately.

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,420
I'm sorry, Fives.
I wish I could stay, but duty calls.

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,790
It's fine, sir.

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,210
Fighting a virus is a nice
change of pace from all those clankers.

40
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,170
Take care of yourself,

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,670
and Tup.

42
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,440
Let's begin the tests.

43
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,940
Administer the stimulant.

44
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,880
Remove his mask.

45
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,510
- What are they doing to Tup?

46
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:17,600
Remain calm.

47
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,130
- Out of my way!
- Oh!

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,050
Please return to
the examination table.

49
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,800
His reactions are normal.

50
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,790
What's going on? General!

51
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,810
General!

52
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,770
No, no, no!

53
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,660
Please return
to the examination table.

54
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,910
Come on!

55
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,400
Remain calm.

56
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,870
Please return to the exam...

57
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,950
His reaction will subside.

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,620
The patient must be awake
for the next round of tests.

59
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,750
I am not fond of these hyper tests.

60
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:57,460
Yes, but they do give us all the
information we need in a timely fashion.

61
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:03,670
There does not seem to be
any sign of infection in the blood.

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,340
- How curious.

63
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,510
The subject has tested
negative on all accounts.

64
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,930
This clone seems to be
in perfect health.

65
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,600
We must be missing something.

66
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,770
Why am I here?

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,690
Is he conscious?

68
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,070
Follow orders!

69
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:25,070
Kill Jedi. Kill Jedi!

70
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,710
Are you finished with your tests?

71
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
For now.

72
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,120
Sedate him.

73
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,450
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,200
Orders. Follow orders. Follow orders.

75
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,710
Follow orders.

76
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,000
It appears this clone
has orders to kill a Jedi.

77
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,460
Perhaps the Separatists found
a way to brainwash him.

78
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,010
Look, is Tup going to be all right?

79
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,430
Have they found anything out?

80
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,470
Please, sit down.

81
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,230
We are using hyper tests, so we should
be getting the results very quickly.

82
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,270
We need to complete
more procedures on you.

83
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,650
- Sorry.
- Why?

84
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,820
Ow!

85
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,400
- Hey!
- I said I was sorry.

86
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,280
You must understand,

87
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,780
organic beings are so much harder
to analyze than droids.

88
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,320
Well?

89
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,120
Everything seems normal.

90
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,620
Oh, great!
Well, that means they can let me out.

91
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,010
I am afraid that is not possible.

92
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,250
You must remain quarantined

93
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:21,840
until we have pinpointed the exact
cause of the other clone's breakdown.

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,300
We cannot risk any further casualties.

95
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,420
Look, I am not a threat,
and neither is Tup!

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,840
Are you certain?

97
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,060
Eh, you're just a droid.
You don't know about real duty,

98
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,020
about what it's like to have a brother.

99
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,140
I am sorry.

100
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,190
I always wanted
to have human feelings,

101
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,270
but I do not. Goodbye.

102
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,210
Maybe whatever is causing
his aggression is psychological.

103
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,630
It seems to be an isolated case.

104
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,890
The other clone has yet
to display any symptoms.

105
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,230
I need an answer now.

106
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,990
This isn't just
a physical manifestation of psychosis.

107
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,610
You must have missed something.

108
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,290
Might I suggest a second brain scan,
an atomic-level brain scan?

109
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,700
This is unnecessary.

110
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,710
The Phase 1 and 2 scans we did
are sufficient.

111
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:46,000
He's too weak
for a Phase 5 atomic-level scan.

112
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,090
I calculate the beneficial knowledge we
could gain from a Phase 5 atomic scan

113
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,940
is worth the risk.

114
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:55,390
The only way to discover
what has happened to this clone

115
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,760
is to terminate him

116
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,980
and do a full-scale autopsy
on the molecular level.

117
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,940
We must be cautious.

118
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,350
I do not believe
this is a physical ailment,

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,730
but a mental condition caused
by possible Separatist brainwashing.

120
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,190
I do not agree.

121
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,280
This is a virus of some kind.

122
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,200
I am in charge of this examination

123
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,490
and I will decide
what is best for my patient.

124
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,750
Actually, since the Republic and
the Jedi commissioned the clones,

125
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,210
it is our responsibility
to oversee their care.

126
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,380
Every clone and their genetic makeup

127
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,710
is property of
the Kaminoan government.

128
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:35,010
Now, as a client of ours,
I will respect your wishes,

129
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,970
but as to the fate of this clone,

130
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:41,020
I will speak to
our Prime Minister, Lama Su.

131
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:45,190
And I will advise the Jedi Council
on the atomic brain scan

132
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,690
and see how they would like to proceed.

133
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,360
Very well.

134
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,660
- Hello.
- What's going on?

135
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,040
CT-5385's condition
seems to be deteriorating.

136
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,080
Tup. His name is Tup.

137
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,040
Tup? What is a Tup?

138
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:09,000
Tup is my friend. He's not a number.

139
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,670
Yes, he is. We all have numbers.

140
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,340
My number is
AZ-345211896246498721347.

141
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
His number is CT-5385.

142
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:22,350
Wrong. He has a name.

143
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,480
No clone uses a number.

144
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,100
Not anymore.

145
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,520
But you are a number, CT-5555.

146
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,360
No, I am Fives. Call me Fives.

147
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,000
But five is a number.

148
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,620
No, not five. Fives.

149
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,830
Oh...

150
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,950
The difference is minimal.

151
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,160
Not to me. And not to any clone.

152
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:55,880
It appears there has been a preemptive
execution of Clone Protocol 66.

153
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,840
How did this happen?

154
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,890
I do not know as of yet.

155
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,100
However, I recommend
we terminate the clone

156
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,940
and do a full autopsy to discover
how the inhibitor chip was activated.

157
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,070
And what of the Jedi?

158
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:16,650
The Jedi Shaak Ti is proposing
an atomic-level brain scan.

159
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,080
She has gone to the Jedi Council to
seek their approval before proceeding.

160
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,000
We must contact Lord Tyranus.

161
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,890
I've been expecting your transmission.

162
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,860
I have heard
of the malfunctioning clone.

163
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,980
How widespread is the problem?

164
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,020
It seems to be an isolated incident.

165
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,900
However, this is a delicate situation.

166
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,320
We need to terminate the clone
as soon as possible

167
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,830
in order to extract and analyze the
inhibitor chip that you provided to us.

168
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,290
Very good.

169
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,750
Terminate the clone immediately.

170
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,210
However, send the chip
to me for analysis.

171
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,630
And what if the Jedi ask for the chip
and the results of the autopsy?

172
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,430
You must remember,

173
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,810
the chip is a safeguard
against betrayal from rogue Jedi.

174
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,020
Master Sifo-Dyas
was the only Jedi who knew of this.

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:34,690
But with his passing,
we alone know of this secret

176
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,330
and you must keep it that way.

177
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,440
Yes, Lord Tyranus.

178
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:44,450
These Jedi are a curious cult.

179
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:47,040
Too spiritual for my taste.

180
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,910
I will terminate the clone immediately.

181
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,580
The Kaminoans have
suggested that we terminate the clone

182
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:58,420
and do a rigorous molecular autopsy
to discover the virus.

183
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:01,170
I believe this solution is ill-advised.

184
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,340
My belief is that Tup has been
brainwashed by the Separatists

185
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,010
using some new process
we do not yet understand.

186
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,850
Brainwashing?
How could that be possible?

187
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,400
General Skywalker reported
Tup missing on Ringo Vinda,

188
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,400
but after five rotations
he turned up again.

189
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,490
That event preceded this episode.

190
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:23,700
Perhaps he was compromised
at that point.

191
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,370
We must find the truth
behind this situation,

192
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,950
or we could find many more clones
turned against us.

193
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,540
I would like to implement
a Level 5 atomic brain scan,

194
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,010
to see if his thought processes
are still functioning normally.

195
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,380
And what do
the Kaminoans think of that?

196
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,210
They feel Tup is so weak,

197
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,010
the Level 5 atomic brain scan
would damage his neural tissue

198
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,730
and possibly kill him.

199
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,020
Their approach
would be to terminate him,

200
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,430
thus leaving the brain
fully intact for the autopsy.

201
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,770
Bring Clone Trooper Tup
back to the Jedi Temple.

202
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,320
Yes. Examine him
with the Force we shall,

203
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,650
and unravel this mystery we will.

204
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,820
Yes, Master.
I'll bring him back immediately.

205
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:13,580
No! There's too much
procedure and protocol here!

206
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:16,760
Tup is a soldier.
He risks his life every day,

207
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,930
and I know he would risk it now

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,630
if it meant finding a cure
for what's wrong with him.

209
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,230
I recommended an atomic brain scan,

210
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,720
but that request has
thus far has been denied.

211
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,680
Then we have to get the results
of that brain scan ourselves.

212
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:34,180
But that is against protocol.

213
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,520
Think about it.
It's your duty to save the patient, right?

214
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:39,770
That is correct.

215
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,900
And you recommended
this atomic brain scan

216
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:45,530
as the best way
to save the patient, right?

217
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,990
That is correct.

218
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:53,910
So, by not performing this scan,
you are letting the patient die, willingly.

219
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,710
Impossible.
That is against my programming.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,420
That's not the way it looks to me.

221
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,350
I cannot perform the atomic brain scan
without disobeying orders.

222
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,770
Check your programming.

223
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,470
I thought saving the patient at all costs
was fundamentally your highest order.

224
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,020
You are correct.

225
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,850
Right. Then let's get to it!

226
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,110
Quickly!

227
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,090
Okay, let's get to work.

228
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,620
The scan is almost complete.

229
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,090
Everything appears to be normal.

230
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,670
Wait a second.

231
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,800
What? What is it?

232
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,510
It appears this clone
has developed a tumor.

233
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,350
Is that even possible?

234
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,520
I have never witnessed
anything like this in your kind.

235
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,940
Well, then, what is it?

236
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,230
I cannot be sure without a biopsy.

237
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,480
You're gonna take it out of him?

238
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,320
What was that?

239
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,820
Do you think anybody heard that?

240
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,990
The probability that somebody
heard that is high, yes.

241
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,960
It came from this room.

242
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,010
Hello, Doctor.

243
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,890
What do you think you're doing?

244
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,270
I was only following protocol.

245
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,100
"Save the patient."

246
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,370
Doctor, I have found something unusual
in this scan.

247
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,130
It appears to be a tumor.
Perhaps you should take a look.

248
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,420
You performed a second
scan without my authorization?

249
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,540
As I stated,
I was following my programming.

250
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,880
Then you are like this clone, defective!

251
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,010
You will be put on report
for deactivation.

252
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,640
But the tumor...

253
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,100
This tumor seems to be
blocking neuro-impulses

254
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,230
from communicating within the brain.

255
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,820
We should scan the rest of the clones

256
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,530
to see if this is a problem
with their base genetic model

257
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,740
or a mutation with the current models.

258
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:18,120
There is no tumor.
Your scan is incorrect.

259
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
But...

260
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:22,380
This clone clearly has
a virus that remains undetected,

261
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,590
but I will find the cause
once he's terminated.

262
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,330
Now leave.

263
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,520
I can't believe it.
They're going to kill him.

264
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,060
In a case like this,
it is the logical course of action.

265
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:52,200
No! No! We were not created
to be disposed of this way!

266
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,990
Perhaps you were.

267
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,240
CT-5385 will be terminated
so that others like him could survive.

268
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:02,240
There aren't others like him.

269
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,700
Tup doesn't have to die.

270
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,330
You found a tumor.
I'm sure that's the cause of all this.

271
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,460
It's the only thing that makes sense.

272
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,260
But how can we proceed?

273
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:13,840
Do your biopsy.

274
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,380
I'm sure what you find
will prove Tup does not have to die.

275
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,970
But Nala Se does not believe...

276
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,890
We're not going to Nala Se
with whatever you find.

277
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,060
We'll go to the General, to Shaak Ti.

278
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
She helped me once, as a cadet.

279
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,270
I know she values the life of a clone.

280
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,820
But we will be disobeying direct orders.

281
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,320
Yep, for the second time today.

282
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,740
Can you hack into
the medical center's mainframe?

283
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,240
I do possess that ability, yes.

284
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,660
All right.
Well, here's what you need to do.

285
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,920
It will be a painless death.

286
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,760
Soon all our questions
will be answered.

287
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,480
You may proceed.

288
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,140
Hurry! You got it? Are you in?

289
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,520
Got it.

290
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,980
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!

291
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,860
All non-essential personnel
report to a safe room for lockdown.

292
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,120
Master Jedi, status report?

293
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,160
Scanners have picked up
an intruder in section C-6,

294
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,460
but we have no visual confirmation.

295
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,000
It could be the enemy
looking for our patient.

296
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,250
I'm on my way.

297
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,630
Please report to a secure room.

298
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:43,720
Hah! Good work, AZI.

299
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:46,820
You better get started
before they figure out it's a false alarm.

300
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,310
Right away.

301
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,840
You might want to turn away
for this part.

302
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,890
I want a report.

303
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,270
It appears to be a false alarm,
triggered from the medical bay.

304
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,820
Medical bay?

305
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,820
It's Fives! Come on!

306
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,450
Is it done?

307
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,460
It is now.

308
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,170
What have you done?

309
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,130
We've saved my friend's life.

310
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,430
This tumor is the cause of his illness.

311
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,180
Give me that.

312
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,110
You can't be trusted.

313
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,100
Stand down, Trooper.

314
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,980
General. I have evidence, it's right here!

315
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,570
I'm free. The mission... Free...

316
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,650
- Tup.
- The mission... Free.

317
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,690
The mission...

318
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,250
What is he saying?

319
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,160
Brother, what mission?

320
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,120
You... You know the one.

321
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,580
The mission, the one in our dreams,

322
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,830
that never ends.

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,500
The one in our dreams...

324
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,630
Oh, Brother,

325
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,970
this is the end.

326
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,010
Forget the mission.

327
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:55,480
Oh, the nightmare...

328
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,350
I'm free.

329
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,580
No. No.

330
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,400
I thought I saved him.

331
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,210
Sir, the clone
CT-5385 has died.

332
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,290
Such a tragedy.

333
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,300
I recommend we do further tests
on this tumor at the Jedi Temple,

334
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,420
to see if it is the cause of the problem.

335
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,590
Or even better,

336
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,550
have the tumor sent
to the Grand Republic Medical Facility

337
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,100
here on Coruscant.

338
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,310
The Jedi Council requested the clone...

339
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,520
I think the Chancellor is correct.

340
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,520
The Grand Medical Facility
is state-of-the-art.

341
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,900
If we are to find an answer to
this puzzle, we will find it there.

342
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,990
We are in agreement then?

343
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,410
Yes, sir.
