1
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,902
<i>The battle for Anaxes!</i>

2
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:23,729
<i>One of the Republic's largest shipyards</i>
<i>is under attack</i>

3
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,225
<i>from Admiral Trench's Separatist Forces.</i>

4
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,237
<i>Jedi Generals Mace Windu</i>
<i>and Anakin Skywalker</i>

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,620
<i>lead a two-pronged assault</i>
<i>on the ground and in the air.</i>

6
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,579
<i>But after weeks of heated battle</i>
<i>and mounting losses,</i>

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,500
<i>the Republic's grip on Anaxes</i>
<i>begins to slip away.</i>

8
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,338
The droids have overrun
our main production facility.

9
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,757
It won't be long before
the Separatists take Anaxes,

10
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,136
compromising our entire reserve fleet.

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,928
Pardon the interruption, General,

12
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:04,058
but Rex here has a good theory
on why we keep, uh... losing.

13
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,154
Please, Captain.

14
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,612
The droid army uses analytics
to predict our strategy.

15
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,414
The first time we use a tactic,
it's very effective.

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,319
The next, less so.

17
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,447
In fact, the more we use a certain tactic,

18
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,828
the less effective it becomes.

19
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,502
They learn our tendencies
and use that data against us.

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,956
To counter them,

21
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,552
we're constantly working out ways
to vary our attack.

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:32,264
But the losses we are experiencing
on Anaxes are not commonplace.

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,472
Exactly.

24
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,931
The counterattacks are so specific,

25
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,522
it's my strategy the droids know,
my playbook.

26
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,726
My concern is that Rex is one of our best.

27
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,941
If the droids can learn to defeat him,
we may all be vulnerable.

28
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,483
What do you propose?

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,395
Let Rex and me take a small squad
behind enemy lines.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,356
There's a Separatist Cyber Center

31
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,947
which relays all battlefield intel
to their command ship.

32
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,874
If we're going to find anything,
it will be there.

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,961
If you think it will help
turn this fight around, get going.

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,625
Thank you, General.

35
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,632
Rex, is there anything else?

36
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,679
No, General.

37
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,286
Come on, Rex. Time to move out.

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,286
Fives, Echo,

39
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,797
and before that, Hevy.

40
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,589
There's so many troopers gone.

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,589
Yeah, regular folk don't understand.

42
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,058
Sometimes in war,
it's hard to be the one that survives.

43
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,643
That's what I'm worried about.

44
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,194
Well, what do you mean?

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,941
I didn't tell the Generals.

46
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,435
They might think I'm crazy.

47
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,073
In fact, you might think I'm crazy.

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,820
What is it?

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,030
I think Echo's alive.

50
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,987
That's not possible.
He died at the Citadel.

51
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,449
The way the droids are countering us here,

52
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:24,906
the strategies I'm using,

53
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,576
they're all old battle plans
Echo and I drew up together.

54
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,997
Look, Rex, I hear what you're saying.
But it's just not possible.

55
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:35,129
I hope you're right.

56
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,928
But the fact is, Echo's fingerprints
are all over these Separatist strategies.

57
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,101
Rex.

58
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,719
You have to admit what you're saying
is a long shot at best,

59
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,388
and most likely, misplaced hope.

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,597
I need you to be focused on this.

61
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,478
I-I know, I know.

62
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,574
Don't worry.

63
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,606
So, what squad are we taking in?

64
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,409
Clone Force 99.

65
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,834
I've heard mixed things about these guys.

66
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,837
They have a 100% success rate.

67
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:18,384
It's not that they win,
it's how they win that worries me.

68
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:22,676
<i>Repeat, coming in hot</i>
<i>on platform TT-3-9-7.</i>

69
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,306
<i>Clear the airfield!</i>

70
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,019
<i>Clear the airfield!</i>

71
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:39,202
So why haven't I heard of this squad?

72
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,663
Experimental unit Clone Force 99,

73
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:46,621
they're defective clones with,
uh... desirable mutations.

74
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:49,907
99, hey? Nice touch.

75
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,125
They call themselves "The Bad Batch."

76
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,308
The cavalry has arrived!

77
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,159
These guys are clones?
They don't look like clones to me.

78
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,956
Sergeant, good to see you again.

79
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,171
-You too, sir.
-This is Hunter.

80
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,710
Sorry we're late, Commander.

81
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,006
We were putting down an insurrection
on Yalbec Prime

82
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,420
when your comm came in.

83
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,048
Had a few unforeseen... complications.

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,136
Ever fought a male Yalbec?

85
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,725
Um, no. Can't say I have.

86
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,230
You're lucky.

87
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,151
Only way to kill 'em is with one of these.

88
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,268
That's right.

89
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,945
Wrecker here cut off the Queen's stinger
while she was still alive.

90
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,532
That's why all those Yalbec males
tried to eat us.

91
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,945
Uh, technically,
they were trying to mate with us.

92
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,873
And, for your information,

93
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:13,793
the stinger of a Yalbec Queen
is a delicacy on some planets.

94
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,674
They call him Tech.

95
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,884
Yeah, he can fill your head
with useless info for hours.

96
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,843
Crosshair, on the other hand,
he's not much of a conversationalist,

97
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,095
but when you have to hit
a precise target from ten klicks,

98
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,718
Crosshair's your man.

99
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,394
So, Commander,

100
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,849
what kind of "suicide mission"
do you have for us this time?

101
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,225
Let's get going.
We'll brief you on the way.

102
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,537
What are you looking at?

103
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,209
We don't usually work with "regs."

104
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,835
"Regs?"

105
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,220
He's talking about regular clones.

106
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:08,051
But don't take it personal.

107
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,176
We're all on the same team,
so cut the attitude and listen up.

108
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,774
Here's the mission.
Our target is this Cyber Center.

109
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,021
It's the "brains" of the entire
Separatist campaign here on Anaxes.

110
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,818
I could demolish that with one hand! Yeah!

111
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,780
This isn't a demo job, Wrecker.

112
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,235
It's strictly a retrieval operation.

113
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,660
Sector One, alert.
Enemy gunship approaching your location.

114
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,247
Come in, Sector One.

115
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,956
Roger, roger.

116
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,585
Fire!

117
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,682
Incoming fire!

118
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,819
We're going down!

119
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,512
We always get shot down
when we travel with regs.

120
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,051
Cody! Help!

121
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,305
He's trapped! We have to do something.

122
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,806
I'll get him.

123
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, Captain. Wrecker, get him out.

124
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,266
Get back!

125
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,073
This is ridiculous!

126
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,071
He's gonna need help
to get Cody out of there.

127
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:52,907
He's gonna get the gunship out of there.
Not Cody.

128
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:10,007
Boom.

129
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:22,903
He has internal damage.

130
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,519
I can cut the pain.
But he needs help fast.

131
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:27,981
We all need help.

132
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,663
That blast gave away our position.

133
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,449
I thought getting shot down
gave away our position.

134
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,906
Everyone, find cover.

135
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,463
We'll hold this position
and let them come to us.

136
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,840
I don't think so, Captain.
That's not our style.

137
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,459
We prefer going to them.

138
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,549
Bad Batch! Plan 82, "Shockwave!"

139
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,728
Let's get to work.

140
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,444
Blast them!

141
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,252
45. Mark 151.

142
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,172
45. Mark 151.

143
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,434
75. Mark 357.

144
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,012
75. Mark 357.

145
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,772
What the--

146
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,566
Spider droids. Fan out!

147
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,669
Any more? Come on!

148
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,636
That was some show you put on just now.

149
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,731
Just doing our job, Captain.

150
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,983
Hey, look, Crosshair,
this little clanker likes you.

151
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,107
Grow up, Wrecker.

152
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,905
We should move out
before reinforcements arrive.

153
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,778
Our position has been compromised.

154
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,471
We wanted to speak to you directly, sir.

155
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,725
This infiltration is irregular.

156
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,855
<i>Were there Jedi with this squad?</i>

157
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,824
Just clones.

158
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:17,284
But using tactics
like we have never seen before.

159
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,909
<i>Interesting.</i>

160
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,871
<i>They're on foot now,</i>
<i>in the middle of nowhere.</i>

161
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,498
<i>Sweep the area, locate these clones,</i>

162
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,751
<i>and notify me if the incursion escalates.</i>

163
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,945
So, I get what makes
the other Batchers unique,

164
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,950
but what's so special about Hunter?

165
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,449
He can put up with the other three.

166
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,874
He was engineered with heightened senses.

167
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,623
A place like the Cyber Center,

168
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,325
Hunter can feel
the electromagnetic frequencies

169
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,956
from anywhere on the planet.

170
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,666
And here I thought we were smart
just using a holomap.

171
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,425
Well, maps can be wrong. Hunter never is.

172
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,940
Hang in there, Cody.

173
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,283
Listen up. We have to move out.

174
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:41,068
Commander Cody's in no position to move.

175
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,704
Already called in Evac.

176
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,821
Kix will stay with Cody until it arrives.

177
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
I'm in charge now.

178
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,251
And I've got a plan
to get into that Cyber Center.

179
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,668
If your plans are so good,

180
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,749
why did Commander Cody have to call us in?

181
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,795
You can't talk to Captain Rex like that!

182
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,009
Says who?

183
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,589
Whoa!

184
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,676
Put him down!

185
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,602
-Stay out of it.
-Hey! Watch it!

186
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,764
Uh, guys, come on.

187
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,100
Wrecker, drop him. Now.

188
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,020
Aw.

189
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,730
Fellas, come on!

190
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,727
We're all fighting
for the same thing, right?

191
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,779
All right then.

192
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,157
Let's cut the chatter
and finish what we started.

193
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,912
We'll do it your way, Captain.
For Commander Cody.

194
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,249
Okay. Let's gear up and move out.

195
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,925
Not our primary target.

196
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,064
It's an outpost. Should we take it?

197
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,147
Probably easier than going around.

198
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,860
All right, what are your orders?

199
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,475
We pick them off from the tree line
one-by-one?

200
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:05,658
Actually, I was thinking
we'd take a page from your book.

201
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,244
Rush them head-on.

202
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,789
I like your style.

203
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,870
Clones! Get them!

204
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,347
Hey! You're not authorized--

205
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,997
Is it over already?

206
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,911
Aw, man!

207
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,916
Not bad. For a reg.

208
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,468
All right, there it is. The Cyber Center.

209
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:10,297
It looks like the Cyber Center itself
has minimal guards, about 30 droids.

210
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,428
Wait. Wait!

211
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,639
I got a massive signal coming in.

212
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,688
A whole platoon of droids
is headed this way.

213
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,609
Someone's noticed our handiwork
back at the crash site.

214
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,149
Yeah.

215
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,032
Make sure you keep an eye
on those incoming Separatist forces.

216
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,360
I want to know
when they reach this outpost.

217
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,735
-You got it, Cap.
-We've gotta move swiftly.

218
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,619
We'll grab some speeder bikes
and flank them from the back.

219
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,887
Do you know what's going on?

220
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:56,219
Maybe it's another drill.

221
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,690
Is everyone in position?

222
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:05,232
Affirmative.

223
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:07,693
Affirmative.

224
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:13,199
Cap, you wanted to know when those
Separatist forces breached the outpost.

225
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,117
Well, they're getting there
just about now.

226
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:29,302
Sir, we tracked
the Clone Strike team here,

227
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,472
they seem to have captured
this location and deserted it.

228
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,471
I cannot calculate the logic
of this assault.

229
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,980
<i>There is no tactical advantage</i>
<i>to taking the outpost.</i>

230
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,611
<i>Their target will be</i>
<i>the nearby Cyber Center.</i>

231
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:47,688
<i>They must know about the algorithm.</i>

232
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:52,198
<i>Get me in contact</i>
<i>with the Cyber Center at once!</i>

233
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:56,529
<i>Put all droids on alert.</i>

234
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,408
<i>An attack is coming.</i>

235
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,745
An attack is coming? When--

236
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,928
<i>All units to the front door!</i>

237
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,606
Hmm. This is a delicate operation.

238
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:31,606
Boom!

239
00:18:31,695 --> 00:18:32,735
You take too long.

240
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,130
We're in.

241
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,984
Tech, get to work on these computers.

242
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:09,274
We'll go get the regs.

243
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,069
What the--

244
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,249
Hey, where did you come from--

245
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,917
What took you so long, Wrecker?

246
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:36,796
Hey, this is a "delicate operation."

247
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,219
Better get in there, Cap.

248
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,156
Okay, I'm in.

249
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,451
-What am I looking for?
-Here's the algorithm.

250
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,285
You're looking for a program
using this sequence.

251
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,125
Found it.

252
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,456
This is strange. It's not a program.

253
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,881
It's a live signal from another planet--

254
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,429
Skako Minor.

255
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:22,055
A live signal?

256
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,725
Crosshair, we're gonna need a lift.

257
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:36,819
Not gonna be a problem.

258
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,204
Here it is. This is audible.

259
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:42,121
Patch me in. I want to hear it.

260
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,709
What is that?

261
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,289
That sounds almost... almost human.

262
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,262
It can't be.

263
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,734
Uh-oh.

264
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,614
We gotta go! Now!

265
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,325
Tech, find out who's sending that signal.

266
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:34,792
Ask who that is.

267
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,841
<i>CT-1409.</i>

268
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,507
-<i>CT-1409.</i>
-I... I don't believe it.

269
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,386
<i>CT-1409.</i>

270
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,809
We're gone. Rex, let's go.

271
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,483
-<i>CT-1409.</i>
-Rex, now!

272
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,186
<i>CT-1409.</i>

273
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,682
We have chased the clones
out of the center, sir.

274
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:30,178
They are retreating back
toward Republic lines.

275
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:34,726
<i>Did they download anything</i>
<i>from the central computer?</i>

276
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,480
There seems to be no intel missing.

277
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,025
But there appears to have been
a connection made with Skako Minor.

278
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:42,526
<i>What?</i>

279
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,576
That number, Cap, what did it mean?

280
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:58,554
CT-1409...

281
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,667
that was Echo's number.

282
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,511
He's alive.
