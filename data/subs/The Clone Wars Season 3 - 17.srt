1
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,820
Stranded!

2
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,410
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka Tano,

3
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,500
are caught in the middle
of a treacherous battle

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,920
between good and evil.

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:32,250
The scales now tipped
toward the dark side,

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,510
our three warriors
must guard against attack

7
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,590
as they plan their escape.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,600
A great weight has been placed
on Anakin's shoulders,

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,600
for it is now that he must face
who he really is.

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,280
I'm getting a little tired
of how unreliable the weather is here.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,700
Some might say that's part of the appeal.

12
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,780
You did well, Anakin. How do you feel?

13
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,330
I'm not sure we're doing
the right thing by leaving.

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,290
The son is consumed by the dark side.

15
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,970
And if we stay, we may be used
to the dark side's advantage.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,630
Well, you want the bad news
or the really bad news?

17
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,760
Well, let's try the bad news,
laced with a little optimism.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,060
We've got two cracked silo pins,
a busted power converter,

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,810
the engines should be
fired twice to dump debris,

20
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,480
and the backup vents need charging.

21
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,940
Sounds terribly downbeat.

22
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,150
Can it be fixed?

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,990
Uh, I can re-route the primary initiator,
weld the dampening vents,

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,160
and that might give us enough power
to leave the atmosphere.

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:48,160
After that, I have no guarantees
she'll hold together.

26
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,500
We'll take our chances.
Better than staying here.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,510
Where are you going?

28
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,940
To see the father.

29
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm not convinced that the son
will be contained here without our help.

30
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,600
Perhaps we should make a stand.

31
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,720
Anakin.

32
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,480
If I don't get the father's blessing
to leave, it'll haunt me forever.

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,430
Forgive me, Daughter.

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,730
I am an old fool who believed
he could control the future.

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,400
Now you are gone,

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,690
and all is lost.

37
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,570
Sleep well, my child.

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,910
Sleep free.

39
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,470
You should have left by now.

40
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Our ship needs repairs.

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,560
Do not underestimate my son.

42
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,770
He will seek your ship
to escape our isolation

43
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,900
and sow terror through the universe.

44
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,110
And while you are here,
he will use you to do it.

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,660
What will you do now that he's
given himself over to the dark side?

46
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,300
It is my actions that have unleashed
great danger on the universe.

47
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,790
I must kill him.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,960
But he's too powerful for you alone.

49
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,460
Hmm. Perhaps.

50
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,920
Perhaps not.

51
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,180
The Force will decide.

52
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,640
I can help you.

53
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,140
The choice is no longer yours to make.

54
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,730
Both our destinies are clouded.

55
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,850
This place is strong with the Force.

56
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,660
Darkness has no hold here.

57
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,830
Go.

58
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,700
Ask, and you will know what to do.

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,340
You have grown strong and powerful,
just as I imagined.

60
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,350
Master.

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,180
Do you believe you are the chosen one?

62
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,180
How can I know?

63
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,030
I can tell you what I believe.

64
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,860
I believe you will bring
balance to the Force.

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,030
That you will face your demons
and save the universe.

66
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:07,200
And this creature of the dark side?
Do I leave or do I stay and kill him?

67
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,610
Neither.

68
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,950
Look deeper. You will find another way.

69
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,910
I don't understand.

70
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,880
Not far from here there is a place

71
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,380
which is strong
in the dark side of the Force.

72
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,960
You must go there.

73
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,100
And destroy the son?

74
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,590
Remember your training, Anakin.

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,550
Trust your instincts.

76
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,090
Master!

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,810
Master!

78
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,780
Might I suggest less sleeping
and a little more work?

79
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,700
Sorry, Master Kenobi.

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,280
Here, this should help.

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,540
We need to change plans.
You must focus on the firing drives.

82
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,800
Disengage them.

83
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,210
But I'm almost finished putting
this junk heap back together and now...

84
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,630
Just do as I say. We don't have much time.

85
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:12,220
You're the boss.

86
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,060
Where's Anakin?

87
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:22,560
He came to me for guidance,
but at the crossroad, only he can choose.

88
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,230
The Force will be his guide now.

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,530
I don't like this. What have you done?

90
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,860
I have done nothing.

91
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,490
I am merely letting the will
of the Force take shape.

92
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,660
Where has he gone?

93
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,040
To the well of the dark side.

94
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,430
Welcome.

95
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,060
I believe there has been
a misunderstanding.

96
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,240
We really don't have to be enemies.

97
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,740
You murdered your sister.

98
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,520
The Force is out of balance.

99
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,400
I have to stop you.

100
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,080
Must you?

101
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,580
Anakin has gone
to confront your son, hasn't he?

102
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,250
Deep within this planet exists a place
where all that is dark is channeled.

103
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,250
And how do I get there?

104
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,250
You cannot interfere.

105
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,930
The way I see it,
if we were not supposed to interfere,

106
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,300
Ahsoka and I wouldn't be here
in the first place.

107
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,100
Look after the ship,
I'm going to find Anakin.

108
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,780
There is no use for such
crude implements here.

109
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,110
I have a gift for you.

110
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,950
I have had enough of your trickery.

111
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,630
Oh, but you'll like this one, I promise.

112
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:50,250
What if I could show you the future?

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,800
No! No! Stop it!

114
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,310
Know yourself.
Know what you will become!

115
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,990
I will not look!

116
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,160
The Force is strong with you.

117
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,290
- Anakin, please!
- You were my brother, Anakin!

118
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,090
A powerful sith you will be.

119
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,010
I hate you!

120
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:41,760
No, no, no!

121
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,370
I will do such terrible things.

122
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,790
Yes.

123
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,620
But it doesn't have to be that way.

124
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,290
The choice is still yours to make.

125
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,710
How?

126
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,340
The future, by its nature, can be changed.

127
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:27,070
Join me, and together we will destroy
this Emperor you see in your visions.

128
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,560
Then, we shall end war, corruption,
and suffering throughout the galaxy.

129
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,160
Will we bring peace?

130
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,320
Of course.

131
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:02,090
Finally!

132
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,430
This is Jedi Shuttle 634
calling on all secure channels for help.

133
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,780
Do you read? I repeat,
we are stranded and need immediate evac.

134
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,350
Come in, please!

135
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,960
Anakin, are you all right?

136
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:40,460
There has been a change of plan.

137
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,970
Sorry.

138
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,220
You will not understand
what I have to do to end the Clone War.

139
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,570
You will try to stop me.

140
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
Anakin, why?

141
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,360
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,700
I have seen that it is the Jedi
who will stand in the way of peace.

143
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,000
He's mine now.

144
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:32,060
Ahsoka, come in, please.
Can you hear me? Ahsoka!

145
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,810
Yes, Master. Any success with Anakin?

146
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,520
No, quite the opposite.

147
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:40,150
Master. What are you saying?

148
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,030
Anakin has joined with the son.
Do not engage him.

149
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
- But...
- Just do as I say.

150
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,500
Listen to me. You have to disable the ship.

151
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:52,700
But I just finished
putting it back together.

152
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,660
Ahsoka, please, listen.

153
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,540
We have to prevent Anakin
and the son from leaving.

154
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,380
Yes, Master.

155
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Ahsoka, what have you done?

156
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,690
Ahsoka!

157
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,340
Hmm, nice job.

158
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:46,980
What took you so long?

159
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,840
Here.

160
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,470
I did as you said.
The shuttle's going nowhere without that.

161
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,770
Good, that gives us some time
to rescue Anakin.

162
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,320
I can't make contact with anybody.
I don't think anyone will hear my signal.

163
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,610
My father still has hold over this realm,

164
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,870
but I will be able to draw
any ship here soon.

165
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,700
If I know my old Master,
he, too, will try to stop us.

166
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,830
Together, with your father,
they could be a formidable opponent.

167
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,170
I can turn the tide in
our favor. Stay here.

168
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,640
What did he show you?

169
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,980
I've seen what I become
and I cannot let that happen.

170
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,650
And for this you join him?

171
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,240
Your destiny can change just as quickly
as the love in one's heart can fade.

172
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:53,070
Nothing is set in stone.

173
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,830
But I will cause so much pain.

174
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,370
If there is to be balance,

175
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,880
what you have seen must be forgotten.

176
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,960
So cold.

177
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,970
It's ironic, my sister.

178
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:56,140
You were the only one I truly loved.

179
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:18,280
Where am I?

180
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,210
I have brought you back to my monastery.

181
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,250
What happened?

182
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:26,620
My son broke the laws of time

183
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,290
and showed you
what you should never have seen.

184
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,310
I don't remember.

185
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:36,050
I have erased that time.

186
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,150
We shall never know.

187
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,430
Master!

188
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,520
Are you all right?

189
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,480
I think so,

190
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,070
but we must stop the son once and for all.

191
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,950
We have little time,
and you will get only one chance.

192
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,830
You know what you must do.

193
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,470
How quaint.

194
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,790
My own personal send-off.

195
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,380
I ask you one last time.

196
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,020
Do not leave, my son.

197
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,260
You have no power to keep me, old man.

198
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,850
You must understand by now
this planet is not my destiny.

199
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,020
What you will do
will destroy all that is good.

200
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,320
I beg you!

201
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,030
Restrain yourself and stay!

202
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,620
I cannot.

203
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,330
And then it shall be.

204
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
I love you, my son.

205
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,460
Do you?

206
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,020
What?

207
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,900
You're going to kill me now?

208
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,570
I held hope that
you could resist the dark side,

209
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,580
but I see now,

210
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,210
there is no going back.

211
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,200
Father. No!

212
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:33,210
What have you done?
It did not have to be this way!

213
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,710
Yes, my child, it did.

214
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,550
You and I are tied together
and your strength runs through me.

215
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,060
This way, I take your power.

216
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,610
Please, don't die.

217
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,440
I always knew there was good in you.

218
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,250
And so you have betrayed me, Father.

219
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,930
It is done.

220
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,430
And now I die,

221
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,480
my heart broken,

222
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,810
but knowing the role you will play.

223
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,490
And what is that?

224
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,860
You are the chosen one.

225
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,280
You have brought balance to this world.

226
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,790
Stay on this path,

227
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:57,170
and you will do it again for the galaxy.

228
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,300
But beware, your heart...

229
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,730
General Skywalker, come in!

230
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,900
We read you, Rex. Can you hear me?

231
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,740
Yes sir, standing by. We were worried.

232
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,530
You were off the scopes
there for a moment.

233
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,120
A moment?

234
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,950
We've been gone
more than a moment, Rex.

235
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,580
Sir, I don't understand.
You'll need to explain.

236
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,120
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

237
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,750
We're coming in now.
