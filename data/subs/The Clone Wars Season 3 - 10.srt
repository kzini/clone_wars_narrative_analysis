1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,580
Conflict with no end in sight!

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,160
Across the galaxy,
the quagmire of war continues.

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,250
While clone troopers suffer casualties
at alarming rates,

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,630
the Galactic Senate
convenes an emergency session

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,130
to debate the true cost of the war.

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,630
Order! Order! Let Senator Saam finish.

7
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:39,680
This is a matter not of philosophy.

8
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,320
More troops are needed.

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,310
The Republic cannot afford to let
the Separatists gain any more ground.

10
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,310
Our generals inform us that troops
in the field continue to perform valiantly.

11
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,370
What we cannot afford
is to be irresponsible.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,110
The Republic is near bankruptcy
due to the cost of this war.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,540
Bankruptcy is not necessary, my friends.

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,660
If we pass Senator Saam's bill
to open new lines of credit,

15
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,500
we will gain access to the needed funds.

16
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,140
Won't this bill essentially
deregulate the banks?

17
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,510
A small price to pay to finance the war,
is it not?

18
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,400
- Keep the war going!
- Keep the war going!

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Members of the Senate,
do you hear yourselves?

20
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,810
More money. More clones.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,480
More war.
Say nothing of fiscal responsibility,

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,530
what about moral responsibility?

23
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,200
Hasn't this war gone on long enough?

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,870
Senator Amidala, are you suggesting
we surrender to the Separatists?

25
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,880
Of course not. But negotiation
might be a better course of action.

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
You can't negotiate with those animals!

27
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,840
Keep the war going! Vote now!

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,730
Members of the Senate,
I suggest we table any emergency bill

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
until it is determined
whether or not deregulation

30
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,850
is the right course of action.

31
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,100
Very well.
We shall let calmer heads prevail.

32
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,280
That legislation would have meant
billions for us.

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,870
I tried my best to push the bill through.

34
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,290
You did your part, Representative.
Senator Amidala is the problem.

35
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,080
I thought age might temper her idealism.

36
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,090
I know people
who could do something about her.

37
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:41,550
That task is more difficult
than you presume.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,430
Gentlemen, the Banking Clan
and Trade Federation

39
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,270
are about business, not violence.

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,850
Hmm. In this case,
our business is violence.

41
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,230
Precisely.
With or without Senator Amidala,

42
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,610
the Galactic Senate is unlikely
to deregulate the banks

43
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,910
until this war hits home.

44
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,780
What exactly are you proposing?

45
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,960
Perhaps some unexpected bloodshed
on Coruscant may change a few minds.

46
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,250
Coruscant? Coruscant has not been
attacked in over 1,000 years.

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,130
Then it has a false sense of security.

48
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,010
There are some powerful clients
on the other side who could help us,

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,800
shall we say, make the point.

50
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,470
I like this plan.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,480
No one cares what you think.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,530
You must ask the Jedi Council
to speak with Chancellor Palpatine.

53
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,030
Don't involve me in this.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,820
A peaceful solution
is the only way out of this morass of war.

55
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,820
That's not my role, Padmé.

56
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,160
Why not? Why isn't it your role?

57
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,670
Aren't we Jedi Knights?

58
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,210
Isn't it our duty to speak our minds
to advise the Chancellor?

59
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,670
Uh...

60
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,630
I'd suggest you teach my young Padawan
a thing or two about politics.

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,680
After today's debate, I was hoping
she learned a great deal.

62
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,180
Truthfully? I don't understand any of it.

63
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,860
I know the Separatists are evil,

64
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,890
but all anyone argued about
was banking deregulation,

65
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
interest rates and, well,

66
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,900
almost nothing about why
we're fighting in the first place.

67
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,410
War's complicated, Ahsoka,
but let me simplify it.

68
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,070
The Separatists
believe the Republic is corrupt,

69
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,860
but they're wrong,
and we have to restore order.

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,410
Maybe talking to the Jedi Council
isn't the role for you, after all.

71
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,080
Thanks for your help. Come on, Ahsoka.

72
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,210
Hey.

73
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,210
You told me to teach her
about politics.

74
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,250
So I'm going to.

75
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,730
There is a problematic situation
brewing in the Senate.

76
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,100
We must ensure that everything
my master has set in motion

77
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,890
does not unhinge.

78
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,230
My representatives in the Republic
are relying on you, General.

79
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,320
See that your droids
complete their mission.

80
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,820
But, of course, Count. They will not fail.

81
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,200
If only I could talk
to Senator Bonteri.

82
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,160
- Who's he?
- He is a she.

83
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,620
A senator in the Confederacy
of Independent Systems.

84
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,090
Your friend is a Separatist?
One of Dooku's pawns?

85
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,920
The Separatists used to be a part
of the Republic.

86
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,340
I was close
with many of the senators who left.

87
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,930
I may not agree with them,
but they're more than pawns.

88
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,350
If you think negotiating is the
right thing to do, let's talk to her.

89
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,520
The Senate's made it illegal.

90
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,810
Illegal?

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,690
They say official meetings would
only legitimize the Separatists.

92
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, Master Skywalker and I hold
what we call "aggressive negotiations"

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,450
all the time.

94
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,710
It's a shame you can't hold
more peaceful talks when you want.

95
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,160
You just gave me an idea.

96
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,620
You're a Jedi,
which gives you special clearance.

97
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,000
Right.

98
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:03,540
And Jedi are allowed to travel
to neutral worlds, like Mandalore,

99
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:07,840
where we could then board a cargo ship
to a Separatist system.

100
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,140
Are you suggesting
I use my status as a Jedi

101
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,810
to smuggle you behind enemy lines?

102
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,930
It's just that you could get us
through to meet with her,

103
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,600
and I haven't seen her,
or her family, in so long.

104
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,150
Relax, I'll help you.

105
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,360
Besides, Master Skywalker said
you should teach me about politics.

106
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,940
Right.

107
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,780
You know, you two have more in
common than you think.

108
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
It's no wonder you get along so well.

109
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,530
Huh. Of course.

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,830
- So, where are we heading?
- Raxus.

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,080
Have all the preparations
been made?

112
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,960
I am about to deploy the infiltrators.

113
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,550
You must hurry, the Senate is restless.

114
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,840
I don't take orders from you,
only Count Dooku.

115
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,520
You have been designed for this mission
to be the ultimate infiltration units.

116
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,400
Some of you may not return.
Actually, none of you will return.

117
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,030
But don't let that get in your way.
Is that clear?

118
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,670
Get them to Coruscant.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,210
Roger, roger.

120
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,380
Move along, please, move along.

121
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,250
Identification, please.

122
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,940
Excuse me, is this Platform B?

123
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,760
- Platform B is the next one, ma'am.
- This way.

124
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,470
Oh, thank you.

125
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,950
Hello, old friend.

126
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,070
Ahsoka, this is Mina Bonteri.

127
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,940
She was my mentor
when I was growing up on Naboo.

128
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,110
You're a Separatist?

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,160
Well, of course, my dear.
What were you expecting?

130
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:40,450
Now, come, I have a transport waiting.

131
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,760
Lux, come down here and help
our guests with their luggage, please.

132
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,980
Padmé, it's so good to see you.

133
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,730
Yes, how things have changed
since the last time we met.

134
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's go inside. There's much to discuss.

135
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,990
Please, allow me.

136
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,450
- May I?
- I can handle it.

137
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,590
He's grown so much, Mina.

138
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,670
Time won't stop, even if we are at war,

139
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:39,970
and I'm afraid these events
are shaping his young life.

140
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,690
With all due respect, as a Separatist,
didn't you create this war?

141
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,020
- Ahsoka!
- It's all right.

142
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:50,520
That's a very polarized point of view,
my dear.

143
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,110
Would it surprise you to know that
many of the people you call Separatists

144
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,360
feel the same way about the Republic?
And the Jedi?

145
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,030
Lux's father was like that.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,280
Maybe I could speak with him.

147
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,200
If only you could.

148
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,040
A year ago next week.

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,210
He was setting up a base on Aargonar
when clones attacked.

150
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,880
My husband fought bravely in self-defense,
but was killed.

151
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,890
Excuse me, I think I'll get some air.

152
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,900
Ah, the cleaning droids. Finally!

153
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,950
Don't waste any time, get to work!

154
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,300
You're a Jedi, aren't you?

155
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes, why do you ask?

156
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,100
Before the war,
I was always told Jedi were good.

157
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,240
And now?

158
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,520
I don't know anymore.

159
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,370
There are a lot
of terrible things happening.

160
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,980
A lot of killing. And now my friends
are saying the Jedi are to blame.

161
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,110
I'm the first Jedi you've ever met,
aren't I?

162
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,820
Well...

163
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,330
Yes.

164
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,990
Look at me. I'm not so bad, am I?

165
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,090
No, not bad at all.

166
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,430
Well, it seems boys are the same
whether they're Republic or Separatist.

167
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,510
Wait!

168
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,930
How many Separatists have you met?

169
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,100
What?

170
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,430
Well, I mean, you think we're all
the bad guys,

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,140
but how many of us
have you actually met?

172
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,730
And droids don't count.

173
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,740
Well, other than military officers,
like Grievous and Ventress, none, I guess.

174
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,790
You and your mother are the first.

175
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,070
Well, look at me. Am I so bad?

176
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,660
I sense Dooku's dirty hand in all of this.

177
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,210
He's just the leader of the Senate.
He's not the leader of the entire universe.

178
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,670
Oh, I forgot. You actually admire the man.

179
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,590
We'll never entirely agree on Dooku,
my old friend.

180
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:30,470
But we can agree on the need
to stop this war, the question is how.

181
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,520
That is why it was so urgent
that I speak with you.

182
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,690
The Republic Senate
is holding a critical vote

183
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,020
on whether or not to escalate
the war effort.

184
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,230
However, many of the delegates
are undecided as to what to do.

185
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,150
How interesting.

186
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,110
You would find the Separatist Parliament
in a similar dilemma.

187
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,030
I am certain if you could convince
your representatives

188
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,000
to extend an olive branch of peace
towards the Republic,

189
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,000
there might be enough sympathy
in the Senate to finally open negotiations.

190
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,420
I admire your spirit, Padmé.

191
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,420
I can at least put the motion on the floor.

192
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,590
Thank you, Mina, that's all I ask.

193
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:10,190
To peace, then.

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,810
To hope.

195
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,900
How many lives on both sides
have to end before we see the futility?

196
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,240
Surely there's room in the galaxy

197
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,570
for Confederate and Republic planets
to coexist.

198
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,080
I move that we immediately open
peace negotiations

199
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,410
with Chancellor Palpatine on Coruscant.

200
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,920
The Corporate Alliance
will never allow this to happen.

201
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,020
This is a democracy,
and unlike the Republic,

202
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,300
corporations do not rule us.

203
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,590
- Nay!
- Quiet!

204
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,020
In accordance with the bylaws
of Independent Systems,

205
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,810
a voice vote is required.

206
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,190
All in favor of initiating peace negotiations
with the Galactic Republic, say aye.

207
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,860
Aye!

208
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,690
- Aye!
- Aye!

209
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,700
All those opposed?

210
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,620
Nay!

211
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,960
Nay!

212
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,960
The ayes have it.

213
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:26,840
This is quite troubling.
Your own Senate voting to end the war?

214
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,810
I assure you, gentlemen,
your worries are gravely exaggerated.

215
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,800
How can you be sure
this groundswell of peace won't continue?

216
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,850
Where is the attack we were promised?

217
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,400
We need fighting to feed the machine
and our profits.

218
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,940
After our attack,
the chances of peace will disappear.

219
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,820
The Banking Clan, the Trade Federation,
and the Techno Union

220
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,320
will all get their fair
share and then some.

221
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,830
Well, this is goodbye.

222
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:05,460
I've been disappointed before,
and yet I almost feel as if, this time,

223
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,510
the tide has turned in the war.
You should hurry.

224
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,800
Goodbye, young one.

225
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,800
You really believe the Republic
will vote for peace?

226
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,020
I hope so. I wouldn't want to meet you
on the battlefield.

227
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,690
For your sake.

228
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,360
Go, you two. Quickly.

229
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,540
Team leaders, come in.

230
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,420
Commence Phase 2.

231
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,340
Proceed with high-security infiltration.

232
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,230
All right, everybody have your passes out.

233
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,210
Hmm. Generator maintenance, eh?

234
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,330
Hmm.

235
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,750
Well, everything checks out,
good luck down there.

236
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,140
Whoa! Wait a minute!

237
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,440
Power generators are that way.

238
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,330
Stupid droids.

239
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,210
Well, well, well.
This is quite a stunning development.

240
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,450
Your Excellency, we would be remiss,
if not irresponsible,

241
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,330
- to reject the Separatists' proposal.
- Of course.

242
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,750
An end to the fighting

243
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,760
would mean there's no need
to borrow money for more clones.

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,510
I can see why
you would want so badly to believe

245
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:17,510
that the Separatists desire peace.

246
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,340
I don't understand.

247
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,140
In the past, whenever we've reached out
our hands in peace,

248
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,680
they've been slapped away.

249
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,600
Can we believe that they're ready to sue
for peace so easily?

250
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,440
If I might speak with you confidentially.
I know that this is sincere.

251
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:38,650
I've been in contact
with my old friend Mina Bonteri,

252
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,120
and the origin of the proposal is with her.

253
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Bonteri?
How was the dialogue established?

254
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,290
Does it matter, Chancellor,
if the result is an end to the war?

255
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,010
I see your point, my child.

256
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,960
Then, we shall put the vote to the floor.

257
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,900
Sweeper droids?
We didn't schedule a cleaning.

258
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,460
What's going on?

259
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,440
Given that the Separatists have
put a call for negotiations on the table,

260
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,520
the need for additional troops
seems ill-timed.

261
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:59,360
Which means there is no need
to deregulate the banks.

262
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,280
I say we vote that down now.

263
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,090
There is a move to vote
on the proposed bill

264
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,100
to lift regulations on the Banking Clan.

265
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,940
Dooku promised he would stop this vote!

266
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,150
You may enter your votes.

267
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,750
We're under attack!

268
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:17,440
The bombing of the power generator
has been confirmed as a Separatist attack.

269
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,690
They must pay for what they have done.

270
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,780
But it was the Separatist Congress
that issued the bill of peace.

271
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,320
Obviously a tactic to lower our defenses
and launch this attack.

272
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,830
No! That's not true!

273
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:34,290
I move to immediately
deregulate the banks.

274
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:38,500
We need a bank loan
to get more troops now!

275
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,500
What are we waiting for?

276
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:46,510
I'm afraid we've been given little choice.

277
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:51,680
To ensure the safety of the Republic,
we must deregulate the banks.

278
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,490
I'm returning your Padawan.

279
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm sorry your talks with Bonteri failed.

280
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,750
How did you know?

281
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,210
We have eyes and ears
everywhere, Ahsoka.

282
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,880
That was dangerous and careless
going to Raxus.

283
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,430
Not to mention illegal.
You went too far this time.

284
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,590
You would do the same.
You do the same all the time.

285
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,850
This was too much.

286
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,440
Maybe so, but I did realize something,
the politics of this war

287
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,270
are not as black and white
as I once thought they were.
