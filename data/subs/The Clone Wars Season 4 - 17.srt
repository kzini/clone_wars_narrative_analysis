1
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,040
<i>Obi-Wan Kenobi in disguise!</i>

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>Working undercover
as assassin Rako Hardeen,</i>

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>Obi-Wan leads a secret mission to uncover</i>

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,250
<i>the Separatist plot
against Chancellor Palpatine.</i>

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,630
<i>Using cunning and courage,</i>

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,420
<i>he gains the trust of
bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,930
<i>and criminal mastermind Moralo Eval,</i>

8
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,970
<i>earning him entrance to the stronghold of
Separatist leader Count Dooku.</i>

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,390
<i>Now it is here,
on the beautiful planet of Serenno,</i>

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,310
<i>that a barbaric contest will determine
the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

11
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,400
<i>and, possibly, the Republic itself.</i>

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,270
Count Dooku, I apologize for my delay.

13
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:38,240
Your careless delay
could have ruined my plan, Eval.

14
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,780
I see Cad Bane is with you.
Who is the other one?

15
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,370
This is Rako Hardeen.

16
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,870
When Bane's escape plan failed,
we only succeeded thanks to Hardeen.

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,960
I thought he might be
useful for the tournament.

18
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,560
Enough small talk, I want my money.

19
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,420
That makes two of us.

20
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,510
You shall have it and perhaps much more.

21
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,400
Both of you, if you would like to
enter our friendly little contest.

22
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,060
I'm in, if he's in.

23
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,900
You already owe me for one job, Dooku,
anything else will cost you triple.

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,190
I assure you
that if you survive the challenge,

25
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,410
the reward will be well worth it.

26
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,420
We have all the contestants we need.

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,010
Prepare the tournament.

28
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,880
Yes, My Lord.

29
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,610
You summoned me, Master?

30
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,320
Wrong to deceive you it was,
but much at stake there is.

31
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,490
So I was right. Obi-Wan is still alive.

32
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:10,790
Skywalker, a powerful Jedi you are,

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,580
yet unpredictable and dangerous
you can be.

34
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,930
To both your friends and enemies.

35
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,130
For Obi-Wan, on your patience
everything depends.

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,930
What if he needs our help?

37
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,140
Hmm.

38
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,970
If you leave, help him you could.

39
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,480
But his future, uncertain is.

40
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,730
Trust in Obi-Wan we must.

41
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,950
So what kind of
"friendly little contest"

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you think the Count's got planned?

43
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,250
I'd be surprised if we all survive.

44
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,420
Nice hat.

45
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,520
Where did you get it?

46
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,190
What are you looking at? It's a nice hat.

47
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,700
Welcome to Serenno.

48
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,120
You have been invited here

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,540
because you are the best
bounty hunters in the galaxy.

50
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,250
Kiera Swan, two-time winner of
the Obsidian Sphere.

51
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,340
Derrown, known simply as
the exterminator.

52
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,420
Sixtat, the Outlands Butcher.

53
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:48,550
Embo, your bounty tallies
were second only to one last season.

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,980
Cad Bane, who needs no introduction.

55
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,930
Rako Hardeen,
the marksman of Concord Dawn.

56
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,060
Jakoli, known for never
bringing anyone back alive.

57
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,740
Onca, you and your brother
have been a legendary team.

58
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,410
This challenge
may prove difficult for you alone.

59
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,700
Twazzi, your acrobatics once earned you
praise from Chancellor Valorum.

60
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,960
Sinrich, inventor of
the holographic disguise matrix.

61
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,540
And, finally, Mantu.

62
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,090
Your people were once a peaceful race.

63
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,420
How far they have fallen.

64
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,180
In a few moments, all 11 of you will enter
what we call The Box.

65
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,320
Some of you will not make it out alive.

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,690
For those who do,

67
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,030
we are looking for
the five most skilled among you.

68
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Any additional survivors will be eliminated

69
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,250
to preserve the integrity of
the job that awaits you.

70
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,540
Place your weapons here.

71
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,300
For those we choose, you will, of course,
be paid most handsomely.

72
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,920
But more than that, you will be a part of
an operation remembered as

73
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,640
a turning point in the Clone Wars.

74
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,890
And when we succeed,

75
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,720
we will bring the Republic to
its pitiful knees.

76
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,730
Listen up!
The Box was designed by me, Moralo Eval,

77
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,660
to simulate certain situations
that might happen on the job.

78
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,610
Go now, enter The Box,

79
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,320
if you have the courage.

80
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,540
That's it, everyone inside. Keep moving.

81
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,200
<i>Before we begin our first challenge,</i>

82
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,660
<i>let me say there is only
one rule inside The Box.</i>

83
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,540
<i>There are no rules.</i>

84
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,710
<i>The point, my friend,
is to escape and quickly,</i>

85
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,170
<i>because only the survivors
will advance to the next challenge.</i>

86
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,770
Dioxis! Breathe it and you are dead!

87
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,860
Every man for himself!

88
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,410
That wasn't so hard.

89
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,720
The way out isn't up. It's down.

90
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:24,430
The filters in my helmet
can protect me for a short time.

91
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,270
I'll scout a way out.

92
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,420
There's a hole in the floor which
gets you below the gas line.

93
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,510
Jump down the hole and follow the tunnel.

94
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,230
What if he's wrong?

95
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,430
You got a better idea?

96
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,540
What took you so long?

97
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:41,930
<i>Moralo Eval is impressed.
No casualties on the first challenge.</i>

98
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,180
<i>I guarantee you
that will not be the case in the next.</i>

99
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,180
Impressive. I sense
something different about that one.

100
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,190
Tell me what you know
about this Rako Hardeen.

101
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,730
He killed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi.

102
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,740
But only with a sniper rifle.

103
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,620
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

104
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,380
- I know how to get out!
- Show me.

105
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,430
There's a pattern to the blades.
Watch, that one's next.

106
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,180
If I can time it right,
I can climb up to that exit shaft.

107
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,270
- Just follow me and time your jump.
- Go!

108
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,320
Get moving!

109
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,540
Hardeen has done it again.

110
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:22,010
I'm beginning to think he may be
the best one to lead this operation.

111
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:26,340
Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you,

112
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,140
but let's see what happens when
he is not the key to their survival.

113
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,730
<i>To reach your final challenge,</i>

114
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,360
<i>you must pass through my ray shield.</i>

115
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,370
<i>The switch to turn it off
is on the other side.</i>

116
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,920
<i>The syringe on the platform contains
a highly electrolytic serum</i>

117
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:07,550
<i>that will allow you to
pass through the shield.</i>

118
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,890
<i>However, it is toxic to all but one of you.</i>

119
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,190
So it would seem.

120
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,430
Ahhh!

121
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,970
Hey, who put you in charge?

122
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,310
Does anyone know
what this gas bag is saying?

123
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,110
I do. He can get us out of this.

124
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,530
He's a Parwan.
His blood can take the electrolytic serum.

125
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,580
Are you certain?

126
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,660
Fifty-fifty.
Depends on the blood type of the Parwan.

127
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,040
Great.

128
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,090
Hurry, use the serum.

129
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:26,060
His blood. How did you know about it?

130
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,270
I used to kill Parwans for a living.

131
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,370
Your box does not appear to be
as much of a challenge as I thought.

132
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,210
Perhaps I should put Hardeen
in charge of the mission.

133
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,880
But this was my plan!
You promised me the lead role!

134
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,520
You have one last test to change my mind.

135
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,430
Do not fear, Count Dooku.
I will show you who is weak.

136
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,240
<i>The final challenge has arrived.</i>

137
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,600
Unfortunately, no.

138
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:00,780
We are going to test your sniper skills.
Hit the target.

139
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,500
Step back, boys,
I'll show you how it's done.

140
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,610
I get it. If we miss the target,
this platform gets smaller.

141
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,530
Soon there won't be any platform left.

142
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:00,520
This is not the first time
you've saved everybody's skin, Hardeen.

143
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,720
Five more hits.
Let's see how good you really are.

144
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,750
Oh, what a shame,

145
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,040
out of charges.

146
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,840
It's also important as a bounty hunter
to be lucky,

147
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,210
and your luck just ran out.

148
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,520
How dare you defy Moralo Eval!

149
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,690
If you're gonna kill him, do it like a man.

150
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,900
<i>You heard him, Eval.</i>

151
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,200
<i>Show us what you are really made of.</i>

152
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,200
You're going to have to
do better than that!

153
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:46,070
You, my friend,
have seen nothing yet!

154
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,900
Let's even the playing field.

155
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,250
<i>Finish him, Hardeen.</i>

156
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,340
<i>Very disappointing.</i>

157
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,170
All due respect, I just wanna do my job
and get my money.

158
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,760
<i>It is unfortunate
that your leadership skills are so lacking.</i>

159
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,890
<i>And the rest,
congratulations on surviving The Box.</i>

160
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,860
<i>Tomorrow you will
kidnap Chancellor Palpatine</i>

161
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
<i>at the festival on Naboo.</i>

162
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,940
<i>With the leader of The Republic
as our hostage,</i>

163
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,070
<i>we will demand the release of
all Separatist prisoners.</i>

164
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,620
<i>If our demand is not met,
the Chancellor will be executed.</i>

165
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,950
<i>Either way,
you will help reshape the galaxy.</i>

166
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:17,620
<i>Once you are all aboard the transport,</i>

167
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,170
<i>Eval will walk you through his plan.</i>

168
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,380
<i>However, the operation on Naboo
will be run by.</i>

169
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,920
<i>Cad Bane.</i>

170
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,260
<i>All of you work for him now.</i>
