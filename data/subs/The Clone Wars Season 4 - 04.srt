thinks you're on the same side.</i>

181
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,478
<i>Have the droids shut down.</i>

182
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,047
<i>Then attack.</i>

183
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,581
<i>Its the only way.</i>

184
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:36,487
Grievous is a bombad warrior,
but wesa shall do as you say.

185
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,632
I always be believen in the
friendship

186
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,262
<i>Thank you, General.</i>

187
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,768
What are we waiting for?

188
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,572
Hmm... Planning attack take a time.

189
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:31,242
You are a man of few words, Boss Lyonie.

190
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,112
Well, uh... Mesa more of a deep thinker.

191
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,917
You are not Boss Lyonie.

192
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:47,069
You have no idea of the
power within my grasp.

193
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:04,341
Yousa army is shut down, General.

194
00:14:10,037 --> 00:14:12,883
Huh? Mesa suggest you surrender.

195
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:21,970
You can't be serious?

196
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,845
How does it feel to die?

197
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,945
Not die... sacrifice.

198
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,231
Jar jar, now.

199
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:47,186
<i>This turn of the events is unfortunate.</i>

200
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:52,176
<i>General Grievous is a critical
part of my plan for the clone wars.</i>

201
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:55,402
<i>He must not remain captive.</i>

202
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:57,504
What is to be done, my lord?

203
00:15:57,506 --> 00:16:00,765
<i>You must lure Skywalker
into a trap,</i>

204
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,224
<i>then negotiate a prisoner exchange.</i>

205
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:05,737
How can you be certain

206
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,777
the Republic will trade Grievous
for Skywalker?

207
00:16:08,784 --> 00:16:14,404
<i>I have no doubt Senator
Amidala will gladly agree to your terms.</i>

208
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:17,392
As you wish, my lord.

209
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:21,061
Rish Loo.

210
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,729
<i>Yesa, Count?</i>

211
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:25,432
I am at your secret laboratory.

212
00:16:25,434 --> 00:16:28,341
Meet me here and leave enough
of a trail

213
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,490
for Skywalker to follow you.

214
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:33,674
I have a surprise waiting for him.

215
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:59,303
Master I have done what yousa asked.

216
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,135
Skywalker isa here.

217
00:17:02,137 --> 00:17:04,571
Young Master Skywalker.

218
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:07,240
You're nothing if not relentless.

219
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,709
What a surprise.

220
00:17:08,711 --> 00:17:09,676
Dooku.

221
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,328
You're a fool, Rish Loo.

222
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:27,728
- Why bring the war to Naboo?
- How quickly you forget.

223
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,632
After all, the war started here years ago.

224
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,634
You were a part of that first battle?

225
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,868
The sith control everything.

226
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:38,238
You just don't know it.

227
00:19:13,846 --> 00:19:16,770
Where-sa Ani?
Hesa been gone mooie long time.

228
00:19:16,772 --> 00:19:19,039
I'm not sure, Jar Jar.

229
00:19:20,042 --> 00:19:21,118
Anakin.

230
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:26,379
Senator Amidala, we meet again.

231
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:28,417
I must regretfully inform
you

232
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,563
that young Skywalker has
been detained.

233
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:34,187
<i>What have you done with Anakin?</i>

234
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:37,858
Now, now, Senator, let's
not become emotional.

235
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,059
What do you want, Dooku?

236
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,361
<i>I'm glad you asked.</i>

237
00:19:41,363 --> 00:19:45,665
I could be persuaded to return
Skywalker to you

238
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:49,069
in exchange
for General Grievous.

239
00:19:49,071 --> 00:19:52,606
I--I can't
do that.

240
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,874
I'm sorry.

241
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,575
You soon will be.

242
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,148
<i>Stop!</i>

243
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,083
<i>You cannot torture a prisoner.</i>

244
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:04,351
Torture?

245
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,920
I don't know what you mean.

246
00:20:06,922 --> 00:20:09,523
I'll give you an hour to
consider my proposition.

247
00:20:09,525 --> 00:20:13,477
I'm sure you will make the right choice.

248
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:16,163
Yousa have to trade with him.

249
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,998
I can't, Jar Jar.

250
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,001
With Grievous captured,
we could win the war.

251
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:25,338
But--but, Padme,
hesa our friend.

252
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,174
I know.

253
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:28,642
I know, Jar Jar.

254
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,044
Mesa think yousa have to deal.

255
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,867
Yousa should listen to Binks.

256
00:20:32,902 --> 00:20:34,514
Hesa right.

257
00:20:56,564 --> 00:20:58,672
Release the General.

258
00:21:24,482 --> 00:21:29,336
- Padme... I'm sorry.
- Shh.

259
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:31,338
It's all right, Ani.

260
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:47,354
Binks, yousa be bombad leader in my place.

261
00:21:47,356 --> 00:21:51,658
Disa second time yousa stoppen
war between us and the Naboo.

262
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,294
And we are grateful, Senator Binks.

263
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,630
Mesa doin my best.
