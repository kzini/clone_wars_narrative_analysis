1
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,410
Mysterious message!

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,660
A transmission has been intercepted
far beyond the Outer Rim,

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,790
deep in the Crelythiumn system.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,630
Why the call has been made,
and from where, cannot be established.

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,500
But buried in the message
is a Jedi distress code

6
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:35,770
that has not been used in over 2,000 years.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,720
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka,

8
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,560
are sent to investigate.

9
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,230
Fearing a Separatist trap,

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,560
they are to meet
with a heavily armed Jedi cruiser.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,270
Rex. Rex, do you read me?

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,150
We're at the rendezvous point
awaiting your arrival. Where are you?

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,740
Sir, we're at the rendezvous point
and there's no sign of you on our scanners.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,120
Oh, come on. That's impossible.

15
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,550
Something's wrong.
We're at the exact coordinates

16
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,620
where the distress signal originated,
but there's nothing here.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,500
Rex is at the exact same coordinates,
and he's not here.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,710
This is getting interesting.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,930
Unable to find you.
Where are you, sir?

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,800
Something's blocking the signal.

21
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,230
Not good.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,970
Everything's dead. Even the life support.

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,600
This is really strange.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,480
There. See?
Nothing to be concerned about after all.

25
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,650
Then what's that?

26
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,000
It's pulling us towards it.

27
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,850
Everyone, strap yourselves in.

28
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,720
Looks as though we're going for a ride.

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,590
I must have blacked out.

30
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,880
Then who landed the shuttle?

31
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,800
Not me.

32
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,220
Where are we?

33
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,890
Some kind of organic mass.

34
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,030
All of our readings indicate
that it's bigger than an asteroid.

35
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,690
But at least the atmosphere is breathable.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,110
Well, this is getting more unusual
by the minute.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,580
I can't even lock down
where in the galaxy we are,

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,530
or if we are even in our own galaxy.

39
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,450
Well, the ship's systems seem fine,

40
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,080
but for whatever reason,
nothing's working.

41
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,510
Hey! I saw something.
A reflection, up on the hill.

42
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,720
I don't see anything.

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,700
Are you the one?

44
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,240
What the... What?

45
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,280
Did you hear that?

46
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,240
I didn't hear anything.

47
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,750
Are you the one?

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,420
- Hello!
- Who are you?

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,250
I am Daughter.

50
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,300
Are you the one?

51
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,800
Uh, the one what?

52
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,110
I will take you to him.

53
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,850
Him, who?

54
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,390
Did you bring us here?

55
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,730
Only he can help you.

56
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,350
There is little time. Follow me.

57
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,360
We must have shelter by nightfall.

58
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,530
And we thought the planet was strange.
How about this one?

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,780
We'll be fine as long as we stay together.

60
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,260
Have you noticed the seasons
seem to change with the time of day?

61
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,590
Yeah.

62
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,860
And there are no animals.

63
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,600
- And you sense it?
- Mmm-hmm. Since we arrived.

64
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,560
The Force is very strong.

65
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,070
An intersection unlike anything
I've ever felt before. Be wary.

66
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,190
Excuse me. Who are you taking us to?

67
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,580
The father, of course.

68
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,910
Of course!

69
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,910
And what exactly are you?

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,080
We are the ones who guard the power.

71
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,080
We are the middle, the beginning
and the end.

72
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,300
Glad she cleared that up for us.

73
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,090
Hey! Look out!

74
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,560
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

75
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,730
It is forbidden
for you to touch me.

76
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,940
Sorry. I was just saving your life.

77
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,280
That was my brother's work.

78
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,460
You are in great danger.

79
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,620
Wait for me. Do not leave this place.

80
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,120
Hey. Wait!

81
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,500
Anakin, are you there?

82
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,500
Are you all right?

83
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,500
Yeah. But our friend here has run off!

84
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,810
Go back to the ship
and try sending another distress call.

85
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,260
I'll follow her
and find out how to get off this rock.

86
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,140
And if this is a trap?

87
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,680
Then I'm not gonna wait around
to find out.

88
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,430
Anakin, stop! Wait for us to find
another way around and meet you.

89
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,980
Anakin?

90
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,610
So reckless and impatient.

91
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,480
He'll find her.

92
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,650
Yes, and what else?

93
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,200
Storm's coming.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,830
- The ship's gone!
- Yes, I see that.

95
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
It was here, no question.

96
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,170
And look, everything's dying.

97
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,550
Did you lose something?

98
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,720
You didn't do as you were asked.

99
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,010
And what was that?

100
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,140
My sister said to wait!

101
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,980
Did she, now?
Well, we were unfortunately separated.

102
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,900
We'd like our ship back, if you don't mind.

103
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,190
Not yet.

104
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,700
Is it true that he is the Chosen One?

105
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,330
What do you know of such things?

106
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,580
What is about to happen shall occur,

107
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,580
whether you like it or not.

108
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,000
You are Sith!

109
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,250
Sith?

110
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,260
Yes.

111
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,050
And no.

112
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,390
The storms here are quite lethal.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,220
If you want to live,
I suggest you find shelter.

114
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,280
What in the universe was that?

115
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,690
I'm not quite sure.

116
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,280
Quick. There's a cave over there.

117
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,920
Whoever I'm looking for
is in that monastery.

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
Welcome, my friend.

119
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,890
What is it that you want from me?

120
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,980
To learn the truth
about who you really are.

121
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,480
One that maybe you have known all along.

122
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:13,730
One you must believe
in order to fulfill your destiny.

123
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,440
Enough with the riddles, old man.

124
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,110
Tell me what's going on here.

125
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,700
As you can see,
there is nowhere else to go.

126
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,840
It is late.

127
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,500
You will be my guest tonight.

128
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,780
Obi-Wan, have you done as I asked?
Have you trained the boy?

129
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,910
Master Qui-Gon? How are you here?

130
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,410
I am here because you are here.

131
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,500
No. I don't understand.

132
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,090
What is this place?

133
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,830
Unlike any other,

134
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,550
a conduit through which
the entire force of the universe flows.

135
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,380
Are we in danger?

136
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,970
This planet is both an amplifier
and a magnet.

137
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,850
Three are here who seek Skywalker.

138
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,980
They, like me,
believe him to be the Chosen One.

139
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,900
You were right,

140
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,480
the Force within him
is stronger than any known Jedi.

141
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,320
I have trained him as well as I could,

142
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,110
but he's still willful
and balance eludes him.

143
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,870
If he is the Chosen One,
he will discover it here.

144
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,710
And if not?

145
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,910
Then you must realize, with his power,

146
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,710
this is a very dangerous place
for him to be.

147
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:19,150
Wake up, my son. I must tell you a secret.

148
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,860
Who's there? Who's there, I said?

149
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,620
It is me, Ani. Your mother.

150
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,620
What kind of black arts is this?

151
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,620
You're dead.

152
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,790
Nothing ever really dies, my son.

153
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,630
I have a secret to tell you.

154
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,520
Then tell me.

155
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,840
Everything you have done,

156
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,510
everything you have learned,

157
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,770
has led you here.

158
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,810
Whatever you are, my mother is...

159
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:54,190
- Is dead.
- And you blame yourself.

160
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,980
Your Jedi training
has served you well, Ani,

161
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,820
but you are more than a Jedi.

162
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,200
Tell me, where is your pain,

163
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,610
so I might take it away?

164
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,580
I was too late to save you.

165
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,540
I failed as a Jedi, and I failed you.

166
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,500
How so?

167
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,590
I tasted only vengeance

168
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,130
when I slaughtered so many
to avenge your death.

169
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:26,050
It is time you realized that your guilt
does not define you, my son.

170
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,260
You define your guilt.

171
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,570
The only love I feel in my heart

172
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,820
is haunted by what would happen
should I let go.

173
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,850
Then it is not love. It is a prison.

174
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,400
But I have a wife. You've met her.

175
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,070
She's everything to me.

176
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:45,860
She is not your destiny.

177
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,160
But I love her!

178
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,950
No! She is a poisoner!

179
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,580
What are you?

180
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,450
Your fate!

181
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,760
Are you happy, child?

182
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,560
Your master, does he treat you well?

183
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,770
What concern of it is yours?

184
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,400
I am your future, your potential.

185
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,440
This is a trick.

186
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,360
There is a wildness to you, young one.

187
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,620
Seeds of the dark side
planted by your master.

188
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,950
- Do you feel it?
- No!

189
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,250
He is like no other Jedi.

190
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,670
Passionate, impulsive,

191
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,880
but I trust him with my life.

192
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,840
There are many contradictions in you.

193
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,800
And in him.

194
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:52,180
Be warned! You may never see your future

195
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,970
if you remain his student.

196
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,560
Leave this planet!

197
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,350
Ahsoka?

198
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,160
I had a vision.

199
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,480
I think Anakin may be in trouble.

200
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,580
Cannot sleep?

201
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,580
To strike an unarmed man
is hardly the Jedi way.

202
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,170
You're a Sith Lord!

203
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,800
You have a very simple view
of the universe.

204
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,090
I am neither Sith nor Jedi.

205
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,840
I am much more.

206
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,140
And so are you.

207
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,860
I see through your spells
and visions, old man.

208
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,060
Tell me what is going on here!

209
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,900
Some call us Force-wielders.

210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,410
The Jedi have never spoken of this.

211
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,660
Hmm.

212
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,080
Few still know of our existence.

213
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,290
In that room, my mother came to me.
But it was not her.

214
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,670
- It was something else.
- Ah.

215
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,130
My son, I suspect.

216
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,720
We can take many forms.

217
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,470
The shapes we embody are merely
a reflection of the life force around us.

218
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,650
You carry a great sadness in your heart.

219
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,240
My children and I
can manipulate the Force like no other,

220
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,780
therefore it was necessary
to withdraw from the temporal world

221
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,030
and live here as anchorites.

222
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,700
As a sanctuary?

223
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,450
And a prison.

224
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,290
You cannot imagine what pain it is
to have such love for your children

225
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:49,460
and realize that they could tear
the very fabric of our universe.

226
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,170
I don't understand.

227
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,640
It is only here that I can control them.

228
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,760
A family in balance.
The light and the dark.

229
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,780
Day with night.

230
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,200
Destruction replaced by creation.

231
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,980
Then why reveal yourselves to us?

232
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,360
There are some
who would like to exploit our power.

233
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,660
The Sith are but one.

234
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,740
Too much dark or light would be
the undoing of life as you understand it.

235
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:25,000
When news reached me
that the Chosen One had been found,

236
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,210
I needed to see for myself.

237
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,550
The Chosen One is a myth.

238
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,710
Is it?

239
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,550
I should very much like to know.

240
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,220
Why don't we find out together?

241
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:44,230
Pass one test and I shall know the truth.

242
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,160
Then, you and your friends may leave.

243
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,200
The longer we stay here,
the stranger this place gets.

244
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,290
It appears the planet is renewing herself.

245
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,720
What about Master Skywalker?

246
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,300
Anakin will not be easy to deceive.

247
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,870
It is time to face your guilt
and know the truth.

248
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,270
Whatever he wants, don't do it, Master!

249
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,610
Let them go. I will not play your games.

250
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,360
Oh, but I think you will.

251
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,200
I have ordered my children
to kill your friends.

252
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,280
The question is,

253
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,580
which one will you choose to save?

254
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,710
Your master?

255
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,630
Or your apprentice?

256
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,800
You must now release the guilt

257
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,880
and free yourself by choosing.

258
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,390
No!

259
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,720
Their powers are too strong
for us, Anakin!

260
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,470
Save Ahsoka!

261
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,980
Let them go.

262
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,230
Only you can make my children
release them.

263
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,780
Anakin! The planet is the Force.

264
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,910
Use it.

265
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,660
You will let them go!

266
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,300
Down!

267
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,720
On your knees!

268
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,360
And now you see who you truly are.

269
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,320
Only the Chosen One
could tame both my children.

270
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,160
I've taken your test.

271
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,540
Now fulfill your promise and let us go.

272
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:37,500
Ah, but first,
you must understand the truth.

273
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,840
Now, all of you, leave us.

274
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,010
Do not trust him.

275
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,510
You think?

276
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,590
I said, leave us!

277
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,560
Do you feel your destiny?

278
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,020
You must see it now.

279
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:59,020
I am dying,

280
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,860
and you must replace me.

281
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,610
Replace you? I can't stay here.

282
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,860
But this is yours.

283
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,530
It has been foretold.
The Chosen One will remain

284
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,790
to keep my children in balance.

285
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,370
No.

286
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,580
I cannot force you to do this.

287
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,380
The choice must be yours.

288
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,800
But leave

289
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,390
and your selfishness shall haunt you
and the galaxy.

290
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,070
Ready to get out of here?
