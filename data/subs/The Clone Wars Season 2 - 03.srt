1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,042
A thief hunted!

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,761
In a daring assault, Anakin Skywalker
and his Padawan, Ahsoka,

3
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:26,081
boarded the warship
of cunning bounty hunter Cad Bane

4
00:00:26,122 --> 00:00:27,921
to recover a stolen holocron

5
00:00:28,002 --> 00:00:30,721
containing a list
of the galaxy's Force-sensitive children

6
00:00:30,761 --> 00:00:32,640
and future Jedi Knights.

7
00:00:32,721 --> 00:00:35,320
After a desperate chase
and duel with the villain,

8
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,560
Anakin and his troops defeated Bane

9
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:41,759
but were forced to evacuate his doomed
vessel without the holocron.

10
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,718
How many made it off this time?

11
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:55,838
Just us.

12
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:59,358
Hey, Denal, good job
frying that bounty hunter.

13
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,636
Yeah, let's get some grub. You hungry?

14
00:01:02,717 --> 00:01:04,157
I'll catch up.

15
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,196
So, what now?

16
00:01:06,238 --> 00:01:08,116
Now we get the injured
to the medical bay.

17
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:11,355
General! There's something
I think you should see.

18
00:01:13,677 --> 00:01:15,996
Hey, trooper! Are you all right?

19
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:20,275
Must have been hit in the head.

20
00:01:20,636 --> 00:01:24,114
It's blood, sir.
And it sure isn't from any of our men.

21
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,353
Wait! You're injured.
That might be serious.

22
00:01:30,794 --> 00:01:33,834
- You're no clone!
- Ahsoka!

23
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:56,750
Admiral, lock down
the hyperspace rings. Hurry!

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,630
What could possibly have happened
since I last spoke with you?

25
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,788
It's Bane. Lock those rings now!

26
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,509
No, lock them all down. Hurry!
- Deactivating hyperspace rings.

27
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:16,947
We'll have to inform the Council.

28
00:02:25,468 --> 00:02:29,586
It is most unfortunate
Bane was allowed to escape again.

29
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:31,346
With access to the names and locations

30
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,986
of the most Force-sensitive children
in the Republic.

31
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:38,386
Inflict devastating damage
on the Jedi Order, he could.

32
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:41,145
We've discovered
Bane's working with the Separatists.

33
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:44,784
There are thousands of children
on that list. Which will he go after first?

34
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:49,943
Small chance there is, through the Force,
the Council may detect them.

35
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:55,023
I have delivered what you wanted.
The Jedi were no problem.

36
00:02:55,504 --> 00:02:59,983
- Anything else I can help you with?
- I need test subjects.

37
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:03,662
Choose four children
and bring them to Mustafar.

38
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:05,742
I will take care of them.

39
00:03:06,383 --> 00:03:09,542
Kidnapping innocent children?

40
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:12,701
Seems like a small-time crime
for the likes of you.

41
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:16,941
Among the children of the Jedi,
there are no innocents.

44
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,178
A jungle world, domed cities I see,

45
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,899
Rodia it is.

46
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:37,858
A house in Kay Tap square.
Yes, I see it, too.

47
00:03:38,339 --> 00:03:42,418
There's an ocean planet,
home to Nautolans.

48
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:47,097
- Glee Anselm?
- Glee Anselm I see not.

49
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:51,336
I sense a place I've been to before.

50
00:03:51,977 --> 00:03:54,696
Waterfalls. Naboo.

51
00:03:54,777 --> 00:04:00,175
Jan-gwa, a village, southern sector.
Sense it strongly I do.

52
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:06,054
- The Gungan child was screaming.
- The future you see, young Skywalker.

53
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:10,374
To Naboo you must go.
Cad Bane you will find.

54
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:12,534
With you take your Padawan.

55
00:04:12,975 --> 00:04:15,573
You're certain
there is no child on Glee Anselm?

56
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:19,013
Into the shadow of the dark side
taken the child was.

57
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,933
Shrouded is his fate from us.

58
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:26,452
Great the loss is,
but more children in danger there are.

59
00:04:26,853 --> 00:04:31,611
- I shall leave for Rodia immediately.
- Find more younglings we will.

60
00:04:39,291 --> 00:04:44,370
Your son is strong with the Force.
He will make a fine Jedi.

61
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,489
Master Ropal said the day would
come for him to go to the Temple,

62
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,369
but not for some time.

63
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,928
Master Ropal was unaware of the danger
your son is in.

64
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:58,008
Jedi imposters
have been roaming the galaxy,

65
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,408
stealing the future younglings.

66
00:05:00,489 --> 00:05:04,127
For your son's protection,
I'm going to have to take him now.

67
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,526
He is my only child.

68
00:05:07,368 --> 00:05:10,846
Look into this. It will relax you.

69
00:05:20,606 --> 00:05:22,405
Let's hope we have arrived in time.

70
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:50,082
If you're looking for my son, Jedi,
he's not here.

71
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:51,841
Where is he?

72
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,961
Open the door!

73
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:58,840
You'll never get him!

74
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:02,160
- Where is the bounty hunter?
- Bounty hunter?

75
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,240
He was a Jedi.

76
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,119
- Jedi do not carry blasters.
- What have I done?

77
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:41,236
General Skywalker,
they told us you were coming.

78
00:06:41,316 --> 00:06:43,156
Has the Gungan family been notified?

79
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,234
Yes. Captain Lunker here
is in charge of the operation.

80
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,155
He will take you to Jan-gwa City.

81
00:06:48,236 --> 00:06:51,834
Let me take the lead, Master.
I've got a score to settle.

82
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,714
All right, go with the Gungan.
I'll be there shortly.

83
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,669
Don't move, sleemo!

84
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:45,868
You weren't the child
I was expecting to find.

85
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:49,027
- Obviously.
- You're quite clever,

86
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,188
but naive!

87
00:08:08,506 --> 00:08:10,144
Looks like I win.

88
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:15,544
I think I've earned the right
to wear this again.

89
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:27,903
- Your daughter is safe now.
- Do you really believe that?

90
00:08:37,222 --> 00:08:40,061
We know you've taken at least
two children. Where are they?

91
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,021
Beyond your reach.

92
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,980
- Who are you working for?
- I work alone.

93
00:08:45,062 --> 00:08:48,740
It is only a matter of time
before we locate the holocron.

94
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,981
Make it easier on yourself.

95
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:54,059
What are you going to do, Jedi,
torture me?

96
00:08:54,821 --> 00:09:00,299
I think the fear of whoever you work for
outweighs your fear of us.

97
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:03,538
This conversation is over.

98
00:09:08,578 --> 00:09:13,058
We tore the ship apart.
There's no sign of the holocron or the kids.

99
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,137
Did you check
the ship's navigation records?

100
00:09:15,178 --> 00:09:18,056
They were wiped clean
before he landed on Naboo.

101
00:09:18,177 --> 00:09:20,776
We'll have to use the Force
to make him talk.

102
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:23,096
I don't think Bane is that weak.

103
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,336
Maybe if we all concentrated
on his mind together.

104
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:31,494
Mmm. Using the Force to compel
a strong mind to cooperate is risky.

105
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:34,814
There is a danger that his mind
could be destroyed in the process.

106
00:09:34,935 --> 00:09:36,735
Well, do we have another choice?

107
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:53,132
- You will take us to the holocron.
- Jedi mind tricks don't work on me.

108
00:09:53,213 --> 00:09:55,612
You will take us to the holocron.

109
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:57,492
Forget it.

110
00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:00,492
You will take us to the holocron.

111
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:04,011
I... I won't.

112
00:10:04,452 --> 00:10:10,330
- And you will take us now!
- I... I will take you.

113
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:13,290
No! Get out of my head!

114
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,689
Perhaps we should try again.

115
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,488
I... I've had enough of that.

116
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:33,808
I'll take you to the holocron.
You'll get your children back.

117
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,886
The Chancellor wants
a report on our progress.

118
00:10:46,007 --> 00:10:49,846
Tell him this is not Republic business.
It's an internal Jedi affair.

119
00:10:49,886 --> 00:10:53,405
I'm sorry to disagree, but as long
as the Jedi are acting as a military,

120
00:10:53,526 --> 00:10:57,724
we should report to the Chancellor,
even on internal matters such as this.

121
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:00,364
Well, then, I guess
you just volunteered to go.

122
00:11:00,405 --> 00:11:02,324
- Give the Chancellor my regards.
- Now, wait a minute!

123
00:11:02,365 --> 00:11:05,523
I agree.
Report back here when you are finished.

124
00:11:06,685 --> 00:11:10,042
This could be a trap, Master.
You sure you don't need us to go?

125
00:11:10,164 --> 00:11:11,962
Of course
it's a trap, Skywalker.

126
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,763
I will contact you
when we find the children.

127
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:18,802
- What if they don't find those kids?
- They will, Snips. Come on.

128
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:33,520
- The coordinates?
- The coordinates are

129
00:11:33,641 --> 00:11:39,119
673117, cross 7RB71.

130
00:11:39,521 --> 00:11:43,599
That will take us into the far Outer Rim.
Neutral space.

131
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,478
Do you want your holocron
and your kids or not?

132
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,717
- Ah, Anakin, it is good to see you.
- Your Excellency.

133
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,555
Excuse us, child.

134
00:12:15,956 --> 00:12:20,475
I understand you made an important arrest
in the plot to destroy the Jedi.

135
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,674
To think a simple bounty hunter
could create such a plan.

136
00:12:24,756 --> 00:12:28,474
I believe someone else, someone
much more powerful, was behind this.

137
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:33,073
- And I don't think it was Dooku.
- Oh? And have you any clues

138
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,232
- as to who it may be?
- Not yet, Chancellor.

139
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,272
Have patience, my boy.

140
00:12:53,991 --> 00:12:59,150
There, there, child.
Soon you will cry no more.

141
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,789
Master, subjects of this age rarely survive
the slave conditioning procedure.

142
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:07,349
I'm afraid the risk is necessary.

143
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:13,228
The natural talent these children possess
is too great to be wasted by the Jedi.

144
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:21,027
I foresee an army of Force-talented spies
in my service,

145
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:26,147
trained in the dark side to peer
into every corner of the galaxy from afar,

146
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:30,786
and my enemies would be helpless
against such vision.

147
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,545
If the surgery fails, I will have lost nothing.

148
00:14:00,222 --> 00:14:02,942
We'll be fine, Cody.
Stay here and watch the ship.

149
00:14:03,023 --> 00:14:05,502
Yes, sir. I'll keep the ship running.

150
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:17,580
- I do not sense any children nearby.
- Neither do I.

151
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:24,060
- Where are you keeping the children?
- The children are safe.

152
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,579
But first, here is your precious holocron.

153
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,019
- Let me get it for you.
- No more of your tricks.

154
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:38,018
Blast!

155
00:14:38,498 --> 00:14:40,577
You certainly stepped in it this time.

156
00:14:55,017 --> 00:14:56,935
So long, Jedi!

157
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,615
Now what do we do?

158
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:20,172
Well, the piloting systems are clean.

159
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:23,013
- Checked the landing gear?
- Double-checked it.

160
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:26,652
I have the feeling Master Windu
and Obi-Wan could have used our help.

161
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:28,292
Look, I don't like
being out of the action either,

162
00:15:28,373 --> 00:15:32,531
- but somebody's got to do this job.
- And it always ends up being us.

163
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:33,971
Hmm.

164
00:15:34,571 --> 00:15:37,491
Bane picked up a lot of volcanic ash
on his travels.

165
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,570
What have you got, Artoo?

166
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:46,050
Looks like Bane erased his navigation
records, but not his fuel computer.

167
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:47,209
So?

168
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:49,569
Well, if we cross the list of planets
we know he visited

169
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:51,329
with the distance he traveled...

170
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:55,128
We may be able to calculate
where else he went! That's a new one.

171
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,048
It's an old Jedi trick
we use to track down smugglers.

172
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:03,288
Okay, let's see, Glee Anselm,
Rodia, Mustafar, Naboo...

173
00:16:03,368 --> 00:16:07,007
Wait. Mustafar?
There were no children on Mustafar.

174
00:16:07,088 --> 00:16:10,927
It's a mining world. Very remote.
Probably stopped there to refuel.

175
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:14,926
That explains the ash.
But it was six systems out of his way.

176
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:18,686
Maybe he met up with whoever he's
working for. It's worth a look, isn't it?

177
00:16:19,686 --> 00:16:21,965
Well, anything to get out of this hangar.

178
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:32,523
I've got the holocron!

179
00:16:47,242 --> 00:16:48,282
Anytime, Cody.

180
00:16:55,722 --> 00:17:00,200
- We're coming up on Mustafar.
- Artoo, begin the landing cycle.

181
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,118
Master, a starship is approaching.
It is not the bounty hunter.

182
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,639
This was unexpected.

183
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,358
Evacuate the children
to my secondary facility.

184
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:26,877
I'm afraid this installation is lost.
We must destroy all the evidence.

185
00:17:26,918 --> 00:17:30,557
Turn off the gravity supports
and let the building sink into the lava.

186
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:33,916
- I beg your pardon, sir?
- Just do as I say!

187
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:48,315
- You sure this is the right place?
- We're gonna find out.

188
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,433
I sense something, Master.
And I don't like it.

189
00:18:03,394 --> 00:18:06,792
It's the dark side, Ahsoka.
This is the right place.

190
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,831
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I heard it.

191
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:18,070
Question is, where are they?

192
00:18:21,672 --> 00:18:22,949
This way!

193
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:27,550
All gravity supports off.

194
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,990
Quick, the Jedi are coming!

195
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:39,548
Turn out the lights. Hurry, hurry.

196
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:56,466
- We're too late.
- I can sense they're still here.

197
00:19:02,547 --> 00:19:06,225
- Be careful of the younglings!
- I know! I know!

198
00:19:49,582 --> 00:19:52,659
- The panel's fried!
- Where's Artoo?

199
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:09,777
Be quiet. It's okay.

200
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:30,895
The base was completely
destroyed, Master.

201
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:35,973
- And so was any clue who's behind this.
- Hmm. Most unfortunate this is.

202
00:20:36,534 --> 00:20:38,254
We still have Bane.

203
00:20:41,054 --> 00:20:42,973
He got away again?

204
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,612
The important thing is
that the children are safe

205
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:47,573
and we have recovered the holocron.

206
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:51,532
The list is intact,
and there is no evidence it was copied.

207
00:20:51,573 --> 00:20:55,451
Still, the future of all Jedi uncertain is.

208
00:20:56,093 --> 00:20:59,291
Move forward cautiously we must.
