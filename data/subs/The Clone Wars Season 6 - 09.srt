1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,370
Lost!

2
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,990
Queen Julia of the planet Bardotta
has been abducted.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,370
If Representative Jar Jar Binks
and Jedi Master Mace Windu

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,316
cannot find the missing Queen
in three rotations,

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,310
a sinister prophecy will be fulfilled.

6
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,210
The bloodthirsty Frangawl cult

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,260
will take over
the Bardottan government

8
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,850
and it's planetary system
will be overwhelmed by chaos,

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,060
death and destruction.

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,740
So, tell me exactly what you saw

11
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,330
when you were being held prisoner
by the cultists?

12
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,970
It's like mesa said.

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,040
The cultists took one of the Dagoyan
Masters and sacrificed him.

14
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,920
Hesa got all crispy-fried,

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,090
and then theysa stole
the Force right out of him

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,810
and put it in a shiny ball.

17
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,930
So the cultists are stealing living Force

18
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:23,720
and trapping it
in a containment sphere?

19
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,060
Yes. Theysa try to steal
my living Force, too,

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,890
but yousa saved me!

21
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,110
Hmm...

22
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,440
And now they plan to do the same thing
with the Queen, but to what end?

23
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,530
The cultists couldn't exploit
the living Force like a Jedi or a Sith.

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,280
I sense something else,
a darker presence.

25
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,540
Maxi big the Force, Masterin Mace,
but howsa we gonna find the Queenie?

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,250
She's still a prisoner.

27
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,210
If the containment sphere

28
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,710
has gathered enough
of the living Force, as you suggest,

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,380
I will be able to sense its location.

30
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,430
If we find the sphere,
we will find the Queen.

31
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,430
Okeday! Wesa make
a bombad team, Masterin Mace.

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,220
Indeed.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,620
Where am I? Who are you?

34
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,960
Jar Jar? Jar Jar, where are you?

35
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:38,920
Unhand me!

36
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,720
Sleep.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,010
No! No.

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,640
Brother, another vision
of the Great Mother came to me.

39
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,100
She said the Jedi knows of the sphere,

40
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,940
and that he is following us here
with the Gungan.

41
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,870
The Great Mother warned us
our plan would be discovered

42
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,530
if a Jedi ever came to Bardotta.

43
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,360
We did not know the Gungan
had such powerful friends.

44
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,570
Mmm... We must hurry.

45
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,700
Once we sacrifice
the Queen and transfer

46
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,870
the living Force
to the Great Mother,

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,470
she will deal with the Jedi.

48
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,860
Letsa get going.

49
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,230
Calm yourself, Representative.
Stay still.

50
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,030
But wesa must hurry.
That city, itsa mooie big.

51
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,950
Wesa have to move fast
to catch the cultists.

52
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,330
We cannot rush into this.
We must remain calm,

53
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,330
and let the Force guide us.

54
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,460
But maybe using da Force
taking too longo, and they getting away.

55
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:01,260
No, running blindly through
the city will only waste time

56
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,130
and allow them to escape,
now be still.

57
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,840
Okeday, Masterin Mace.

58
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,810
I see people, market, streets...

59
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:16,350
Yep, mesa see dat from here, too.

60
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,560
I see, crowds...

61
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,690
Wait, a square, a market square,

62
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,120
and the sphere...
I see it... And the Queen.

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,490
Let's go!

64
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,250
Wait, wait! Mesa thought
wesa not rushing in!

65
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,710
That was before
we knew where we were going.

66
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,420
Now the chase is on!

67
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,720
Mesa getting a creeping feeling here.

68
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,850
Do not center on your anxieties, Jar Jar.
Keep moving. This way.

69
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,410
This is it. The market square
I saw through the Force.

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,740
Stay alert.
The Queen may be close by.

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,080
I'm going topside for a better view.

72
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,920
Okeday.

73
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:21,710
Uh, hello?

74
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,350
Nope. No, thank you.
Mesa already got one of those.

75
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,010
Jar Jar, help!

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,260
Huh? Julia?

77
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,730
Jar Jar!

78
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:35,390
Julia! Masterin Mace, come quick!

79
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,140
Jar Jar, wait!

80
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
Uh-oh.

81
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,300
Jar Jar... What in the...

82
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,480
Mesa bet they're bringing
the Queenie this way.

83
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,370
- Queenie!
- Jar Jar!

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,670
Julia!

85
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,720
I've got this.
Keep after the Queen.

86
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,110
Oh, Julia!

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,290
Binks.

88
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,180
Mesa need to be brave.

89
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,330
Representative Binks!

90
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,110
Masterin Mace,
theysa went this way! Hurry!

91
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,750
Stop them!

92
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,650
Oh, boy.

93
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,400
Masterin Mace!

94
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,430
Queenie, mesa coming!

95
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,760
Why are you stealing the living Force?

96
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,600
The Shadow will come,
the Great Mother.

97
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,100
She will deal with you Jedi, you will see.

98
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,190
Have a nice nap!

99
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,530
Theysa gone!
They speeded away bombad fast.

100
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,280
Wesa need some kind of ride.

101
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,930
You're lucky I have no time to argue.

102
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,670
Let's get moving!

103
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,150
The appointed time draws near.

104
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,440
The sun and the moons
are almost aligned.

105
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:40,110
The Jedi is unyielding.

106
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,990
He will
arrive too late to save the Queen.

107
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,790
I have seen it in my visions.

108
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,620
Once the Great Mother
is in possession of the sphere,

109
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,580
she will combine her powers
with the living Force,

110
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,080
and a new order will arise.

111
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
Hyah!

112
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,020
Jar Jar!

113
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,360
Jar Jar, please.

114
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,230
Oh, Mesa sorry, Masterin Mace.

115
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,030
I'm just worried about the Queenie.

116
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,740
I understand your fears
and I am trying to help you,

117
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:28,290
but for now, keep your mind
focused on the task at hand.

118
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,830
That is the best way
you can help your friend.

119
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,830
Whysa you thinking
they want Queenie so badly?

120
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,210
As the spiritual leader of her people,

121
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,500
the living Force inside the Queen
must be very powerful.

122
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,170
Whoever the Great Mother is,
she wants that power.

123
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,220
Well, wesa not let them have
Queenie's Force.

124
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,010
No, we will not.

125
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,310
When we get to the temple, I'll handle
the guards and whatever evil we find.

126
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,480
You focus on the Queen.

127
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,520
And wesa good guys will triumph.
Right, Masterin Mace?

128
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,740
Yes.

129
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,510
Great Mother, my visions
have come to fruition.

130
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,600
At last, you are here.

131
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,100
You may rise.

132
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,020
Do you have the living sphere?

133
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:47,030
I can feel the power of the pure spirit
resonating in this orb!

134
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,210
The Jedi comes.

135
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,700
This temple is well protected.

136
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,500
When they arrive, the stone guardians
will deal with them.

137
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,630
We must begin the ritual at once.
Come.

138
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,510
Who are you?

139
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:15,810
The hour is far too late to trouble
yourself with such matters, my dear.

140
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:23,230
It may help you to know, however,
that I am not a natural Force wielder,

141
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,320
like the Jedi or Sith.

142
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:31,200
I use dark magic to achieve power.

143
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,830
But as a Bardottan,

144
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,960
you possess a strong connection
to the living Force.

145
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,130
A connection that will now be mine.

146
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,800
Never! I will not succumb to your evil!

147
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,680
How noble.

148
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:59,310
Upon that tower rests a device
that can harness the energy of the sun.

149
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,870
When the lenses are aligned,

150
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,150
the energy will rip your spirit from you

151
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,280
and I will gather it here.

152
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:16,950
With the combined power of your spirit
and my dark magic,

153
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,210
I will become more powerful

154
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:25,090
than any Sith or Jedi.

155
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:39,180
I see the Queen. The ritual has started.
Let's go.

156
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,820
Oh, boy. Masterin Mace!
Masterin Mace!

157
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,780
Oh, nosa! Demons!

158
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,620
Get behind me!

159
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,720
Mesa needing
some help back here!

160
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,040
Jar Jar, are you... Okay?

161
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,080
Look, mesa found a bang booma gun.

162
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,760
Nice work.

163
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,130
The Jedi have defeated
the stone guardians!

164
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,760
You mean the Jedi and the Gungan!

165
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,010
Jar Jar!

166
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,980
Mesa here, Queenie!

167
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,980
Master Windu.

168
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,980
I assume you are the Great Mother?

169
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,830
No, I am a simple witch,

170
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,610
not worth the trouble or attention
of the great Jedi Order.

171
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,080
A Nightsister!

172
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,620
Get the Queen!

173
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,750
Oh, boy!

174
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,560
Your power is no match for my magics!

175
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,060
Magic is only an illusion!

176
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,050
Hurry, Jar Jar!

177
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,680
Jar Jar, I knew you would save me.

178
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,000
Mesa never let anything
happen to you, Queenie.

179
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,920
Jar Jar, Your Highness,
over here.

180
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:50,140
I saw the witch when
I looked into the Force.

181
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,310
Jar Jar, I wanted to tell you.
I knew you would stop her.

182
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,030
You should be thanking Masterin Mace.

183
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,370
Jedi Master, I owe you my life.

184
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,580
It is my privilege to serve you,
Queen Julia.

185
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,790
Perhaps this is a new beginning
for the Bardottans and the Jedi.

186
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,080
Perhaps.
