1
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,540
<i>Republic victory is at hand!</i>

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,180
<i>Clone troopers,
under the command of the Jedi,</i>

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
<i>have successfully invaded
the Separatist-occupied world of Ryloth.</i>

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,860
<i>Anakin Skywalker
battles the enemies in the skies,</i>

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,420
<i>while Obi-Wan Kenobi frees villages</i>

6
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,540
<i>from the grip of vile Separatist leader
Wat Tambor.</i>

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,860
<i>Now Jedi General Mace Windu
leads the attack on enemy lines</i>

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,420
<i>in the final offensive to liberate
the capital city of Lessu.</i>

9
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Take cover.

10
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,820
- We have stopped the enemy advance.
- Give me those.

11
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,180
Good.

12
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,900
Now order our cannon
to target their rear units.

13
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,020
We'll box them in
and blast them to pieces.

14
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
We're pinned down!

15
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
Commander,
bring out the Lightning squad.

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,580
I want Lightning up here now!

17
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,940
Get the injured back.
I'm gonna clear the road.

18
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:59,140
- Sir, the enemy is advancing again.
- Let me see.

19
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,220
Find some cover.
Move it! Let's go!

20
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,700
He's all yours, General.

21
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,540
We'll lead the way, Commander.

22
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,860
Forward!

23
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,980
Now that Jedi is leading the attack.

24
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,660
Concentrate all your fire
on those walkers!

25
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,700
Should we run?

26
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,100
It would be better
if we just surrendered.

27
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,300
How many men did we lose?

28
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,700
32, I think,
including command crews of 3 walkers.

29
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,900
The good news is,
General Kenobi's broken their lines.

30
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,580
We have a clear path
straight to the capital now.

31
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,140
<i>This battle was costly.</i>

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,820
<i>We're going to need help
to take the city.</i>

33
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,180
The Republic is advancing faster
than I expected.

34
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,100
I calculate they will reach
the main gates by morning.

35
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:22,620
- I recommend we prepare our retreat.
- I will not retreat.

36
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,260
That Jedi does not have the troops
to take this city.

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,900
Bring our units inside the walls
and secure the bridge.

38
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,580
<i>What's your progress, Skywalker?</i>

39
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,980
<i>My fighters have secured control
of the space around Ryloth.</i>

40
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,060
<i>We have the Separatist cruisers
on the run.</i>

41
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,060
<i>Very good, General Skywalker.</i>

42
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,700
Master Kenobi has taken
the Jixuan desert,

43
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,820
so the southern hemisphere is ours.

44
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,540
<i>Then it's almost over.</i>

45
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,500
Not yet. The key position
is the capital of Lessu.

46
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,680
Our spies are certain

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,500
the Separatist leader Wat Tambor
has his command center there.

48
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,460
<i>When taken the city we have,
capture Tambor we must.</i>

49
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,180
It's not going to be easy, Master.

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,660
Tambor has chosen
his stronghold well.

51
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,460
This plasma bridge
is the only way in or out.

52
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,180
<i>I'm afraid a siege
could drag on indefinitely.</i>

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>My people have suffered so much
already.</i>

54
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:17,660
<i>A plan you have, to take the bridge,
Master Windu?</i>

55
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,980
With our forces stretched so thinly,

56
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,900
I'm gonna enlist the help of the freedom
fighters led by Cham Syndulla.

57
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,260
His fight against the droids has made him
a symbol of freedom for the people.

58
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,740
<i>Cham Syndulla...</i>

59
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,260
<i>was a radical before the war.</i>

60
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
<i>He is very unpredictable.</i>

61
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,180
<i>He can't be trusted.</i>

62
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,940
<i>I know
Syndulla seeks to gain power.</i>

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,820
<i>We were political rivals.</i>

64
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,300
I'll leave the politics to you,
Senator.

65
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,700
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to help these people.

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,660
<i>Perhaps we could send you
Republic reinforcements instead.</i>

67
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,020
<i>There are no reinforcements available,
Chancellor.</i>

68
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,660
We can't win without Syndulla's help.

69
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,740
What makes you think
the rebels are this way, General?

70
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,780
What is it, sir?

71
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,660
The resistance fighters
ride creatures native to this region.

72
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,220
And these tracks are fresh.

73
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,820
Which means they can't be that far.

74
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,420
Isn't this the spot
where they were massacred?

75
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,620
Looks like
it was quite a fight.

76
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,820
Wonder who put up these gravestones.

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,740
Is that them?

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,540
<i>Your tactical droid has informed me</i>

79
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,540
<i>of the pitiful job you have done
protecting our investment on Ryloth.</i>

80
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,420
That droid exaggerates.

81
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,620
I have not lost yet.

82
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,340
<i>You're no match for Master Windu.</i>

83
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,020
<i>Do not become greedy, Emir Tambor.</i>

84
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,860
<i>Take what valuables you can
and destroy everything else.</i>

85
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,300
Everything?

86
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,620
<i>We can put this defeat
to political use.</i>

87
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,620
<i>The charred ruins of Ryloth
will demonstrate to the galaxy</i>

88
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,940
<i>the cost of a Republic victory.</i>

89
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,540
As you wish.

90
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,980
Keep on the lookout
for that lost patrol.

91
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,300
Did you hear that?

92
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,060
I don't see anything.

93
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,340
Why didn't we take them out, sir?

94
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,940
I have a feeling
the rebels will do it for us.

95
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,180
- Look out! It's an ambush!
- Help!

96
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,820
It's the resistance!

97
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,100
I was wondering when you'd find me,
Master Jedi.

98
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,700
General Syndulla,

99
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,140
- I've come for your help.
- What makes you think you'll get it?

100
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,790
Emir Tambor, our bombers
are nearly ready for launch.

101
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,750
And now I will ready your ship
for evacuation.

102
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,630
I am not yet ready to leave.

103
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,790
In any case, we have a schedule to keep.
The ship will be ready.

104
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,510
- Some hideout you have here.
- It has advantages.

105
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,710
We saw the graves

106
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,910
of many of your people
in that battlefield as well.

107
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,870
Together, we can prevent that
from happening again.

108
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,550
Do you know why we were massacred,
Master Jedi?

109
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,510
When the droids swept over Ryloth,

110
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,790
the Republic was unable to help us.

111
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,030
We were forced to surrender,
and we came here unarmed.

112
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:42,390
The Separatists brought tanks
to exterminate us.

113
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,630
Come here, boy.

114
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,030
Come on. Don't be afraid.

115
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,430
See, there's nothing
to be afraid of here.

116
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,670
He says his blurrg
may be ill-tempered,

117
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,990
but she's much faster
than your riding machines.

118
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,390
I don't know about that.

119
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,150
What is this, a scratch?

120
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,350
Gobi, get better.
I need you.

121
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,710
We have little food or drink,

122
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,150
but it is our tradition to share
what we do have with our guests.

123
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:36,390
Target every Twi'lek village
in range,

124
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,390
- the inhabited ones first.
- Of course.

125
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,350
Our scouts reported in
from the village up ahead.

126
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,910
The enemy's already pulled out, sir.

127
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,310
Friendlies are all that's left,
mostly women and children.

128
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,110
See if we can spare some rations.
They'll be hungry.

129
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,950
Sir, enemy ships
are entering our sector.

130
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,590
- Damage report!
- There's no tactical damage, sir.

131
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,950
It didn't hit us.
They bombed the village.

132
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,870
Make contact with General Windu.

133
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,630
I hope you don't mind this.

134
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,390
A little distraction goes far
to ease the burden of the war on my men.

135
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,950
You have provided well for your men,
all your people.

136
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,830
So why won't you help me
free them from this occupation?

137
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,150
I don't trust Senator Ta, his plans
for our world after the war.

138
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,750
The Republic will help you rebuild.

139
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,230
- We won't abandon you.
- Your troops will stay for security?

140
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,990
For a while, to keep the peace.

141
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,150
Another armed occupation
is not a free Ryloth.

142
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,670
How long before I am fighting you,
Master Jedi?

143
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,630
What is it, Commander?

144
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,710
<i>The droids have begun
a firebombing campaign.</i>

145
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,150
<i>Several villages in our sector
have been destroyed, sir.</i>

146
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,350
Make the arrangements.

147
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,110
I will speak to Senator Ta.

148
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,790
Is this all of it?

149
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,670
We are still awaiting two transports
from our southern base.

150
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,110
- Should we depart without them?
- No.

151
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,390
I will have every valuable on this rock
before I leave.

152
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,510
<i>Emir Tambor,
why haven't you evacuated?</i>

153
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,830
Our exit strategy
is taking more time to implement.

154
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:57,990
<i>I want you out of the city
before the Republic arrives.</i>

155
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,910
<i>Once Master Windu
has invaded the capital,</i>

156
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,030
<i>you will bomb it from afar.</i>

157
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,790
- <i>Am I understood?</i>
- Yes, Count Dooku.

158
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,190
You will not do anything
until I give the order.

159
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,550
We have our orders, Emir.

160
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,910
Senator Ta,

161
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:23,270
so glad you could join us
from comfortable Coruscant.

162
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,910
Our people have survived
with only me.

163
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,950
<i>I knew you would try to turn this
into a campaign to take power.</i>

164
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,430
<i>Need I remind you
that it is I...</i>

165
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,910
<i>who leads our people in the Senate?</i>

166
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,270
And it is I who leads our people
here and now.

167
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,070
There will be nothing left to lead
if you two refuse to work together.

168
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:45,190
- <i>General Windu, do you copy?</i>
- I hear you, Skywalker.

169
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,470
My fighters are taking out
the bombers

170
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,910
as fast as they can, Master Windu,
but there are just too many.

171
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,790
<i>I doubt we can stop them all.</i>

172
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,230
<i>I suggest you get the people
away from the cities.</i>

173
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,590
You must destroy those bombers,
Skywalker.

174
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:59,750
- Then meet me at the capital.
- <i>I'll do what I can.</i>

175
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,070
<i>What can the Separatists
hope to gain</i>

176
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,870
<i>from burning our homes?</i>

177
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,110
Nothing.

178
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,390
Wat Tambor spoils for others
what he cannot possess.

179
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,390
<i>Then we must act quickly.</i>

180
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,070
Senator,
your people are hesitant to join us

181
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,870
because they're worried there'll be
another military occupation.

182
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,670
<i>The people have my promise</i>

183
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:27,310
<i>that the clone army will leave</i>

184
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,630
<i>once Ryloth is free of those droids.</i>

185
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,870
What assurance can you give Senator Ta
you will not try to assume power?

186
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:40,150
I only want to see my people free,
Master Jedi.

187
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,790
I give my word.

188
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,750
I believe in democracy.

189
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,710
Then we are together in this.

190
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,230
Men of Ryloth,

191
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,390
the time has come

192
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,670
to free ourselves!

193
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,310
Keep moving.

194
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:24,110
Try and keep up, clone.

195
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,390
Tambor is still there.

196
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:39,750
How are we going to attack
with my people so close?

197
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,630
Your people will never be in danger

198
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:44,270
if our walkers can cross the bridge
into the city.

199
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,550
The key is
getting control of that bridge.

200
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,030
Perhaps there is your way.

201
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,390
My spies tell me
those transports carry treasure.

202
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,670
You think we can use them
to get across the bridge?

203
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:02,150
It is risky.
They are usually scanned while crossing.

204
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,470
When I get control of the bridge,
you must start the attack.

205
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,190
They're in. Let's go.

206
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,230
Commander,
I'll need you to create a diversion.

207
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,550
<i>Get the rest
of Lightning squadron ready.</i>

208
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,630
Yes, sir.

209
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,750
My men are ready.

210
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,790
It is time to leave.

211
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,630
The Republic walkers
are holding at 1,200 meters.

212
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,390
Sir, the last shipments of treasure
are approaching.

213
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,910
Just in time.

214
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:03,150
Activate the bridge
and get them across immediately.

215
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,870
Initiating plasma projectors.

216
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,710
All right, hold it there.

217
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,990
Let's go.
The boss wants this done.

218
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,310
This one's all clear.

219
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,710
Here they come.

220
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:58,710
Wait!
I'm picking up an anomaly in there.

221
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,350
Stay alert.

222
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,630
Trooper, prepare to fire.

223
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,590
Open the cargo hatch.

224
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:15,910
- Oh, no!
- You're under arrest. You have the ri--

225
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,950
We're under attack!

226
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,310
Deactivate the bridge!

227
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:26,750
Oh, well. Too bad for them.

228
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,390
Run for it!
They're turning the bridge off!

229
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,870
I'll hold them off.
Get that bridge back up.

230
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,070
Sir, yes, sir!

231
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,910
Charge!

232
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,270
Save it.

233
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,990
Bridge is up, sir.

234
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,910
You take these droids.
I'll go find Wat Tambor.

235
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,430
My ship!

236
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,870
I'm afraid Emir Tambor refused
to retreat in time.

237
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,630
<i>That is... unfortunate.</i>

238
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,230
<i>Order our bombers
to destroy the capital immediately.</i>

239
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,350
Surrender.

240
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,230
General Windu,
perhaps we can come to a compromise.

241
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,710
Not when I hold all the cards.

242
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:10,870
It appears
a surrender is unnecessary.

243
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,470
We will all perish for the glory
of the Separatist alliance.

244
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,510
- That was close, Master.
- Isn't it always, Snips?

245
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,870
What are your terms for surrender?

246
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,070
They're unconditional.

247
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,750
Agreed.

248
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,490
I thank you, Master Jedi.

249
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,130
Today, all of Ryloth thanks you.

250
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,030
You've earned your freedom, General,
all of you.
