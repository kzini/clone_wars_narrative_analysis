1
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,370
Warprofiteers!

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:23,450
In time of war, credits are
the fuel that fund all operations.

3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:26,500
Senator Amidala is sent to Scipio
to resolve matters

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,420
between the Republic
and lnterGalactic Banking Clan.

5
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,130
Here she is reunited with Rush Clovis,
a once close friend,

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,380
but now known traitor to the Republic.

7
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,930
When Clovis reveals corruption
at the core of the Banking Clan,

8
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,770
Senator Amidala
helps him steal vital files

9
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,600
that may uncover
the full extent of the plot.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,480
Anakin Skywalker is sent
to rescue the Senator

11
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,110
and escort the information
back to Coruscant,

12
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,940
leaving the Banking Clan in chaos.

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,080
The Jedi Anakin Skywalker
should never have been allowed

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,160
to leave with the Senator in tow.

15
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,920
Any future disruptions will be placed
upon your shoulders, Nix Card.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,420
As you wish.

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,800
Sir, we have confirmed
that Rush Clovis was on the Jedi's ship.

18
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,590
Then there's nothing we can do.

19
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,550
But they have the files!

20
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,640
Unfortunate, yes, but they need
more than just files to incriminate us.

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,730
That will only take them time.

22
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,620
We will all be destroyed.

23
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,440
We must remain calm.

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,900
The only way
they could find our secret accounts

25
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:40,200
is if one of us told them.

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,990
I want it noted that you
and you alone allowed this to happen,

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,290
and that it has put us all at risk!

28
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
You're late! What news?

29
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,190
Clovis, the Senator
and the Jedi are on their way.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,410
- With the information?
- Enough.

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:23,620
Good. Then we can continue
to the next stage of the proceedings.

32
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,530
And what about me?

33
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,210
You will be protected, I can assure you.

34
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,870
Master Yoda?

35
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,540
We weren't expecting
such a formal welcome, Master.

36
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,550
A personal request of the Chancellor's,
my escorting you was, Senator.

37
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,760
Adventures have you had
on Scipio, hmm?

38
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,260
- Have you met Rush Clovis?
- Met we have, yes.

39
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,260
Intrigued we are by your return
to Coruscant.

40
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,100
Much distrust is focused upon you.

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,940
I understand, but I hope to right
the wrongs that I have done.

42
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,650
Delay, we must not.

43
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,120
Excuse me
if I find it hard to trust you, Clovis.

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,040
You used to sit on this very Senate

45
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,370
even as you funneled credits
into the droid foundries of Count Dooku.

46
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:57,750
I understand all of your trepidation.
But there is corruption in the banks.

47
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,380
And once we find this corruption?

48
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,510
I believe the ones responsible
should be ousted from control

49
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,260
before the entire
banking infrastructure collapses.

50
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,190
Oh, and I suppose
you're the man to do it?

51
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,770
I only want the Banking Clan
to be what it once was,

52
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,310
a fair system of trade and commerce.

53
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
I came here to root out the criminals

54
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,810
and reveal the truth
behind what is happening.

55
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,070
Now, now, we are grateful
for you bringing us this information,

56
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,860
but what exactly can you prove?

57
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,540
These files show that huge funds
have been diverted out of the banks

58
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,710
and into what I believe
are private accounts.

59
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,170
And the veracity of this information?

60
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,800
I was the one who downloaded the files
from the Muuns' secure mainframe.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,630
I believe that what Clovis is saying
is correct.

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,470
Then, Senator Amidala, I would like you
to spearhead this investigation.

63
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,890
Work closely with Rush Clovis and find
and expose these secret accounts.

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,770
Once we know exactly
what we are dealing with,

65
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,110
then we can decide
how best to handle this situation.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,580
Why didn't you just say no?

67
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,750
Say no. Why?

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,710
I don't want you working with Clovis.

69
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,170
You don't want me working with him?

70
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,220
A serpent can shed its skin,
but it is still a serpent.

71
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,390
Well, you're just going to have
to trust my judgment here.

72
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,730
Like the last time, hmm?
When you almost ended up dead?

73
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,900
Or how about you just getting arrested,
and it was me who had to bail you out?

74
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,190
The Chancellor has asked me
to do this, Anakin.

75
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,700
But I am asking you to say no.
As your husband,

76
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,370
I demand that you tell the Chancellor
you are stepping down.

77
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,490
Demand? We've been over this before.

78
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,710
I'm not foolish enough to allow myself
to be deceived twice, Anakin.

79
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,670
My sole intentions are
to defend the Republic.

80
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,710
- If you can't trust me...

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,510
Uh, excuse the interruption, Padme.
Shall we begin?

82
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,220
Yes, of course.

83
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,970
General Skywalker.

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
Darth Tyranus,

85
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,620
it is time for you once again
to recruit our friend Clovis.

86
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,130
He appears to have lost his way.

87
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,710
And how would you like me to do that?

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,590
We're going to help him
take over the Banking Clan.

89
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,270
But first, you must entrap him,

90
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,760
so he has no one else to turn to.

91
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,270
Of course, my Lord. As you wish.

92
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,490
I've been looking for you.

93
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,240
- Something wrong?
- You tell me.

94
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,530
Not that I'm aware.

95
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,710
Master Yoda feels that yourjudgments
concerning Rush Clovis are clouded.

96
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,170
Hmm. I believe he can't be trusted.

97
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,800
Yes, but there is more, isn't there?

98
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,260
I sense a deep anger in you
by my simply saying his name.

99
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,890
He almost got Senator Amidala killed,
and I would have been responsible.

100
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,640
The Senator has risked her life
many times.

101
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,070
She's quite capable
of taking care of herself.

102
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,060
They had a relationship once.

103
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,860
I simply feel
she's vulnerable to her emotions.

104
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,530
She is, or you?

105
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:53,820
What are you implying?

106
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,160
Anakin, I understand to a degree
what is going on.

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,500
You've met Satine. You know
I once harbored feelings for her.

108
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,960
It's not that we are not allowed
to have these feelings. It's natural.

109
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,540
Senator Amidala and I
are simply friends.

110
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,840
And friends you must remain.

111
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,550
As a Jedi, it is essential you make
the right choice, Anakin, for the Order.

112
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,890
I understand my responsibilities.

113
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,680
Responsibilities that must be observed

114
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,480
whatever relationship develops
between Clovis and Senator Amidala.

115
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,900
They have no relationship.

116
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,610
It is simply business between them.

117
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,070
Then we should have
no problems, should we?

118
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,720
The opera was wonderful, but
I am glad we can get down to business.

119
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,480
If you look here,

120
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,440
the Separatists haven't been repaying
any interest on their loans.

121
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,020
But still the Banking Clan is promising
to lend credits to the Republic.

122
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:12,690
Credits they simply don't have.

123
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,780
But where have all the savings gone?

124
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,570
Each of the files that you downloaded

125
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,040
shows hundreds and hundreds
of small withdrawals.

126
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:22,080
Small enough to remain
undetected individually,

127
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,990
but as a sum total,

128
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:27,260
- a devastating theft.

129
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,960
Whoever is behind this is no fool.
We need to find out who's benefiting.

130
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,020
We're still lacking
a critical piece of information.

131
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Whatever we find must remain
between only you and I.

132
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,470
This would be
highly dangerous information

133
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,520
- should it get into the wrong hands.
- Of course.

134
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,440
This reminds me

135
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,940
when we had three nights
to prepare for the Senate hearing

136
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,360
to rescue Bromlarch's
planetary aqueduct system.

137
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,490
And together
we saved a people

138
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,740
from total drought and famine.

139
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,030
I don't think either of us
got any sleep that whole week.

140
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,660
Let alone ate anything.

141
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,130
We're not as young
as we used to be.

142
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,470
- We're not that old either.

143
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,880
You might be right.
Perhaps we should eat something.

144
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:22,840
So, Clovis, why have you gotten
so involved with the Muuns?

145
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,720
I believe in the banks.
The system works.

146
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:27,220
The Muuns aren't bad people.

147
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,350
It's just a dishonest few

148
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,490
who are destroying everything
for their own gain.

149
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,900
You know, you've never told me

150
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,480
how you rose to such heights
within the Banking Clan.

151
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,650
It's not a happy story.

152
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,490
My father was personal attache

153
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,320
to the household
of one of head Muun families.

154
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,160
We were basically servants.

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,410
I had no idea.

156
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,460
As I grew up, the head of the family took
a personal interest in my education.

157
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,750
I was the same age as his children,
and so we all studied together.

158
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,600
When my parents and his wife
were killed in a shuttle accident,

159
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,340
he adopted me.

160
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:04,470
- How old were you?
- Twelve.

161
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,600
That must have been very hard.

162
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,930
I was accepted as their child
everywhere we went.

163
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,770
I almost forgot where I was from
until I looked in the mirror.

164
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,540
- They sound like good people.
- They are. Most Muuns are,

165
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,360
and they want this corruption ended
more than I do.

166
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,570
You should know my contacts
within the Muun government run deep.

167
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,740
I have many allies,
should I need to call on them.

168
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,540
I didn't appreciate
how personal this was for you.

169
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,130
- Now, maybe you will trust me.
- I'm here, aren't I?

170
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,630
I want to thank you
for everything you've done for me.

171
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,986
I don't think I would have had
the strength alone.

172
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,470
Clovis, don't.

173
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,470
- It's that Jedi isn't it?
- General Skywalker?

174
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,230
We're friends, nothing more.

175
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,270
Friends don't argue
the way I saw you arguing today.

176
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,560
You're confused.

177
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,690
Isn't it forbidden
for a Jedi to have romantic ties?

178
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,950
He would be banished from the Order,
would he not?

179
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,780
There is nothing romantic
between he and I.

180
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,740
Then there is absolutely nothing
to stop us from doing this.

181
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,710
Clovis! Clovis, no!

182
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,000
Get away from her!

183
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,710
Anakin! No!

184
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,670
Why don't you try fighting like a man
without your Jedi tricks?

185
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,390
Oh, it would be my pleasure.

186
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,680
Both of you stop this!

187
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,020
You don't have a say in this!

188
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,860
I thought you said
he didn't have feelings for you?

189
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,530
Ahhh! I see you for what you truly are!

190
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,210
You're a serpent, a traitor!

191
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,430
Please! Stop this! No!

192
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,590
Is that all you got?

193
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,550
You should accept
that the Senator

194
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,270
- has other interests than you.

195
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,440
Skywalker, you fool.

196
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Stop it! Anakin, stop!
What are you doing?

197
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,610
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,580
Senator Amidala,
is everything okay in there?

199
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,870
No. Come in immediately.

200
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,540
What has happened here?

201
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,170
There was an attack.

202
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,460
It was good fortune
to have General Skywalker here.

203
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,010
They escaped in a speeder
over the balcony.

204
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:48,300
Is that what happened, sir?

205
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,600
If that's what the man says.

206
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,850
A medic droid is on its way.

207
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,850
Please, help Clovis into the bedroom.

208
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,230
Padme, I'm...

209
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,780
Stay away from me.

210
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,420
- How is he?
- Nothing that won't heal.

211
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:32,010
I'm so sorry, Padme.

212
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,150
I don't know what came over me.

213
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,100
What's done is done.

214
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,770
It's just when I saw you
about to kiss him...

215
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,980
And I regret that,
but it was not what you thought.

216
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,660
And you must know
I don't care for Clovis.

217
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,290
Don't you?

218
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,490
I've told you why I'm doing this,
but still you refuse to accept it.

219
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,420
- You could have killed him, Anakin.
- I know.

220
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,090
This marriage is not a marriage, Anakin,
if there isn't any trust.

221
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:06,170
We said at the beginning
that this could be a terrible mistake.

222
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,420
What exactly are you saying?

223
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:12,090
That other people who are married
have everything that we don't,

224
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,640
everything that we won't.

225
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,510
We live in secret, Anakin.

226
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Like it or not, our relationship is built
on lies and deception.

227
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,820
No relationship can survive that.

228
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,770
I know I went too far. It's just...

229
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,270
It's just something inside me snapped.

230
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,070
I don't know who's in there sometimes.

231
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,110
I just know that I'm not happy anymore.
I don't feel safe.

232
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,280
But, Padme...

233
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,450
I think it's best
if we don't see each other anymore.

234
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,500
At least not for a while.
I'm sorry, Anakin.

235
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,630
Um...

236
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm sorry, too.

237
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,050
Everything all right, Senator?

238
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,260
No.

239
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,750
Nothing appears to be broken.

240
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,330
But more importantly,
someone wants to speak with you.

241
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,040
What are you talking about?

242
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,830
I am a servant of Count Dooku.

243
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,840
- Hello, Clovis.
- What do you want, Dooku?

244
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,100
It appears we have a mutual problem
that I would like to fix.

245
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,020
I know the Separatists have not been
repaying their loans to the banks.

246
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,850
Now why would we
support corruption?

247
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,060
You expect me to believe

248
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:50,190
that Lesser and his associates
have no ties with you?

249
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,540
They've allowed you to borrow credits
and not pay any interest.

250
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,870
What you say is correct,
but that information, if made public,

251
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,990
will only bring war to Scipio,
and the banks will fall.

252
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,910
Nobody wants that.

253
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,540
So in the interests of all,

254
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,670
I suggest we come
to some arrangement.

255
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,330
What are you saying?

256
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,800
That the banks need
new management,

257
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,550
and that it could be you.

258
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,550
That I would like help.

259
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,220
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were afraid.

260
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:24,140
I prefer the term careful.

261
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,810
These are delicate matters.

262
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,730
We need funds just as the Republic
does to pay for this war.

263
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,940
I can give you the location
of the secret accounts

264
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,070
you are searching for

265
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,820
so you can plead your case
to the Senate.

266
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,820
And you won't stand in my way?

267
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,030
We'll even start paying the interest
on our loans

268
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,450
to show the Republic
our full endorsement.

269
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,790
What do you get out of this?

270
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,510
Stability in unstable times.

271
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,630
The location of the accounts
are on this disk.

272
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,010
Now, where were we?

273
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,400
The Muun government
has seized the accounts

274
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,070
and arrested the heads
of the Banking Clan.

275
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,400
We are indebted to Rush Clovis
for his service to our people.

276
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,950
Well, I have done
only what I thought was right.

277
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,870
Considering the information,

278
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:25,620
it appears that the Separatist
government has agreed

279
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,790
to allow you
to be the new head of the banks.

280
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:33,670
- And the Republic?
- I can only give you my endorsement.

281
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,170
Now, all that stands in your way
is the Senate.

282
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,430
Order! Order!

283
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,310
- Good luck.
- Thank you!

284
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,070
Rush Clovis
will now address the Senate.

285
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,410
Traitor!

286
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,400
Clovis?

287
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,490
I come to you today
with irrefutable evidence

288
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,630
that the heads of the Banking Clan
have been stealing funds

289
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,200
and have virtually bankrupted
the system.

290
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,370
What?
How dare you!

291
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,750
I know the Muuns to be
a good and honest people,

292
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,720
and that it is the actions of only these
unscrupulous few who are responsible.

293
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,640
I humbly ask you for your nomination
in taking over the banks.

294
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,970
What can you do?

295
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,520
I will restore order

296
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,230
and return the banks back to secure
and neutral negotiations

297
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,350
and transactions.

298
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,310
How can we trust you?

299
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,860
I vow to be impartial

300
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,860
and show no favor
to either side in this war.

301
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,440
But you have colluded
with the Separatists!

302
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,330
It is the Separatists' ties to Rush Clovis

303
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,280
that has allowed them
to accept this nomination.

304
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,540
He also has the full support
of the Muun people.

305
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,120
And what of the Chancellor?

306
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,040
I believe that in these dangerous times,

307
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,210
the bank must be protected at all costs,

308
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,880
and that a man
who has no allegiance to either side

309
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,260
and the support of the Muun people
is our best hope.

310
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,430
Then we shall put it to a vote.

311
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,280
A resounding majority
in support of the nomination.

312
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,560
My boy, I can tell
this has been a difficult time.

313
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,600
I've known you too long
not to see something is troubling you.

314
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,430
Your Excellency, forgive me,

315
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,270
but you have made a mistake
by trusting Clovis.

316
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,520
Have I?

317
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,110
Rest assured,
my public endorsement of Clovis

318
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,790
is not the same
as my private confidence in him.

319
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:10,250
Then what exactly is going on here?

320
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:12,790
We will watch him closely.

321
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,450
I don't dispute your distrust of him.

322
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,920
I think there is something
we haven't unearthed yet,

323
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,790
and I would very much like
for it to surface.

324
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,170
But people have been hurt,
could be hurt, in the process.

325
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,390
Let us make sure that doesn't happen,
shall we?
