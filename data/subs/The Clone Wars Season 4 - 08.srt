1
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,870
<i>Turning the tide!</i>

2
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,700
<i>As Separatist control over vital
but isolated supply routes expands,</i>

3
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,130
<i>Republic forces invade a key planet,
the darkened world of Umbara.</i>

4
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,840
<i>In the midst of helping
Obi-Wan Kenobi's battalion</i>

5
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,380
<i>conquer the Umbaran capital,</i>

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,230
<i>Anakin Skywalker
is called away to Coruscant.</i>

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,130
<i>His battalion is temporarily placed</i>

8
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,760
<i>under the command
of Jedi General Pong Krell,</i>

9
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:42,310
<i>a shrewd and temperamental leader.</i>

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,310
<i>Krell's reckless strategy</i>

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,850
<i>forced Captain Rex to retreat
with his platoons in a disastrous defeat.</i>

12
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,600
We have got to move
before those fighters come back.

13
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,220
Rex! Rex, over here!

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,890
Jesse, take the right flank.
Dogma, take the left flank.

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,690
It'll be okay,
buddy. This will ease the pain.

16
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,450
<i>The capital city's too fortified.</i>

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,450
<i>We need your battalion to help us take it.</i>

18
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,140
Resistance from the Umbarans
has been greater than anticipated.

19
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,770
We're holding our ground at the moment.

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,340
<i>We've gathered intel
on an airbase to the west.</i>

21
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,060
<i>It is re-supplying the capital's defenses.</i>

22
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,220
Incoming! Incoming!

23
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,630
Get down, get down!

24
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,440
<i>If you could capture that airbase,
it will sever the capital's supply lines</i>

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,770
<i>allowing the rest of our forces to move in.</i>

26
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,230
I'll see to it that the airbase
is placed under our control.

27
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:13,860
<i>Remember, General Krell,</i>

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,780
<i>the entire invasion
depends on your battalion.</i>

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,030
Captain Rex,
have those coordinates mapped

30
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,380
and all troops ready
to move out immediately!

31
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,580
Yes, General!

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,200
There's a base there, all right,
and it's heavily guarded.

33
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,370
At least three tank divisions, plus guns.

34
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,980
We'll advance along the central gorge

35
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,610
and engage their forces
in a full-forward assault.

36
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,290
The gorge is narrow, sir.

37
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,530
We'll only be able to move our platoons
in single squads.

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,370
Perhaps a closer recon will tell us
if there's a more secure route.

39
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,420
Obi-Wan and the other battalions
are holding off the enemy right now

40
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,750
while they wait for us
to take out this base.

41
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,800
We don't have time
to look for a more secure route.

42
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:22,550
Yes, sir.

43
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,650
All right, listen up.

44
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,810
We'll assemble the squads
into two divisions.

45
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,980
We'll move straight up this gorge
towards the airbase at the far side.

46
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,150
The casualties are going to be high.

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,990
Is Krell trying to get us killed?

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,030
You know, I wasn't sure
that Krell was crazy before,

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,120
but now I'm positive.

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,000
We had to retreat from the capital

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,330
because the General pushed
a flawed strategy. Now this?

52
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,790
I don't know! Could be fun.

53
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,500
Well, I, for one,
agree with the General's plan.

54
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,510
We're running out of time
and this is the best option.

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:08,220
No recon? No air support?
We don't know what we're up against.

56
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,930
They have weapons
we've never seen before.

57
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,430
A few of General Skywalker's plans
seemed reckless, too,

58
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,770
but they worked.

59
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,020
Yeah, but General Skywalker is usually
leading his men up in the front

60
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,690
not bringing up the
rear like General Krell.

61
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,030
A full-forward assault
would leave us too exposed.

62
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,766
We have to look at other options.

63
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,950
- It's going to be a meat grinder.
- Fives.

64
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,380
It would help if you eased their minds.

65
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,220
What, you mean coax them into following
another one of Krell's suicide missions?

66
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,970
We lost a lot of men last time.

67
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,850
Krell may do things differently,
but he is effective in getting them done.

68
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,690
He's a recognized war hero.

69
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,730
He may have had some victories,
but have you seen his casualty numbers?

70
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,980
More troopers have been killed
under his command than anyone else!

71
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,230
That's the price of war, Fives.

72
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,030
We're soldiers.
We have a duty to follow orders and,

73
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,160
if we must, lay down our lives for victory.

74
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,460
You believe that,

75
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,090
or is that what you were
engineered to think?

76
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,410
I honor my code. That's what I believe.

77
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,100
- Is everyone clear on the plan? Hardcase?
- Yes, sir.

78
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,770
- Fives, are you clear?
- Yeah.

79
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,770
All right, get in your groups.
Let's move out.

80
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,680
Everybody stay alert.
Fingers on the trigger.

81
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,640
They look spooked.

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,890
What the...

83
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,280
Oh, skrag!

84
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,490
Blast it!

85
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,970
Look out!

86
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,950
Its head is ray-shielded!

87
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,850
We need rocket launchers!

88
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,160
Mayday, mayday!
Rex, we need rocket launchers now!

89
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,330
Get those rocket launchers down there!
Move it, troopers!

90
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,550
- Take it, take it.
- Thanks, buddy.

91
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,900
I got him, I got him.

92
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,560
Go! Go, go, go!

93
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,680
Keep moving, keep moving!

94
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,760
- That was close.
- You got a point there.

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,550
Move it, trooper.

96
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,600
Everyone regroup, now! Take cover!

97
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,470
Move it! Move it!

98
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,940
We're safe for the moment,
but they'll be coming around any second.

99
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,610
Bring up the launchers,
spread detonators along that corridor.

100
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,200
Trap them into the bottleneck.
We're going to blow those things sky high.

101
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,620
Hurry up, we only have a few seconds.

102
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,630
Here they come!

103
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,630
Hey, come on! Over here!

104
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,986
- Let's see how tough you are!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

105
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,300
Right over here!

106
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,800
Over here!

107
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,320
We got her! We got them!

108
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,910
Good job! All right, let's move out.

109
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,770
That one's still got some juice in it,
waste it!

110
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,860
Sure.

111
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,370
No juice left in him either.

112
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,000
Hey! Still hungry?

113
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,670
Chew on that!

114
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:18,010
Everyone, keep moving.

115
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,630
Hey, Kix, leave it.

116
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,450
We've got a problem.

117
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,120
Fall back! Fall back now!

118
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,310
What are they doing?

119
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,770
Captain, continue your attack!

120
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,150
Sir, we're overpowered.
We need reinforcements!

121
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,570
The rest of the battalion is holding
the entrance to the gorge, Captain.

122
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,690
They're guarding it so your troops
can break through to the airbase.

123
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,630
- Sir, we can't possibly...
- You must stand your ground!

124
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,780
Do you read me?

125
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,950
<i>Captain, are you listening?</i>

126
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,870
Do not fall back! That is an order!

127
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,460
The platoons are in the formation
you requested, General.

128
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,710
Should I send them
to support Captain Rex?

129
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,470
I'll give the order when I give it,
Sergeant Appo.

130
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,060
Keep the wounded as quiet as possible.

131
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,980
All right, you heard the General. Let's go.

132
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,820
You can't be serious.

133
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,240
I used to think General Krell was reckless,

134
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,530
but now I'm beginning to think
he just hates clones.

135
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,200
The Captain is right. Now let's move out.

136
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,580
We can't take them head-on.
We need to find another way.

137
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,420
You got any ideas?

138
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,750
Then this is it.

139
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,630
Okay. Let's do it!

140
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,800
The rocket launchers
don't work on these things!

141
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,070
Help me with the wounded!

142
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,070
We got to get these guys out of here.

143
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,750
Forget it, we have to leave them!

144
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
We can't just leave them, sir!

145
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,460
You don't have a choice. That's an order!

146
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,590
You sound like General Krell.

147
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,630
Look, Kix, it's more important
to save yourself right now.

148
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:51,480
If we survive,
you can patch up the wounded later.

149
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,720
We're finished.

150
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,310
We've still got some fight left in us, Tup,
and I've got an idea.

151
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,150
What were you thinking?

152
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,520
Remember what you were saying

153
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:06,030
about finding another way
to destroy those tanks?

154
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,400
- Yeah.
- Well, I have a mission for you.

155
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,950
CT-7567, where are you?

156
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,740
<i>General Krell, we've come up with a plan
to infiltrate the airbase.</i>

157
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,290
What is your plan?

158
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,710
<i>I've dispatched two men
on a stealth incursion into the airbase.</i>

159
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,340
<i>They've been ordered to co-opt starfighters
and use them against the tanks.</i>

160
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,760
You what?

161
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,670
You've put this entire assault on your hope

162
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,220
that two clones can do
what your entire group could not?

163
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,140
<i>Sir, the rocket launchers
don't work on these tanks</i>

164
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,350
<i>and it'll be easier to slip by undetected</i>

165
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,490
<i>while the rest of us
keep the tanks occupied.</i>

166
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,990
Captain, you will launch
a full-forward strike immediately

167
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,520
or you will be relieved of duty.

168
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,650
We need to hold out as long as we can.

169
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,200
I'm trusting Fives and Hardcase
to pull this thing off.

170
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,330
The second they spot us, I start blasting.

171
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,000
Hardcase, can't you take it easy for once?

172
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:02,920
Stick to the plan, instead of guns blazing.

173
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,040
I'm sorry, it's just how I am.

174
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,500
My commander on Kamino said my
growth acceleration chamber had a leak.

175
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,630
Made me hyper-active, I guess.

176
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,270
Shh! There's the airbase.

177
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Hmm...

178
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,480
Some kind of sensor wall.

179
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,360
Use the tree to get over the sensor wall.

180
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,700
Uh, how am I supposed to do this, exactly?

181
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,330
Figure it out.

182
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
"Figure it out, Hardcase. Figure it out."

183
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,970
What's to figure out
about climbing up a tree?

184
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,750
How about you try it next time?

185
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,630
Great, nice view.

186
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,560
I prefer a good fight
to all this sneaking around.

187
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,970
Wow, I never actually thought
that would work.

188
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,170
So, how do I start this thing?

189
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,880
Well, how should I know?
Start pushing buttons!

190
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,520
Glad these things are ray-shielded.

191
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,460
I don't think I can do this!

192
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,840
Watch out!

193
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,820
Let's hope this trip was worth it.

194
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,320
All right, let's go!

195
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,920
Hey, Kix, put it down, you're wasting aim.

196
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,810
- Clear out, Captain!
- The big guns have arrived, sir!

197
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,910
Take that!

198
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,630
That's the stuff!

199
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,970
Whoo-hoo!

200
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,480
Way to go, boys!

201
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,770
Attaboy, Hardcase!

202
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,650
All right, let's bring them home.

203
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,360
Impressive.

204
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,320
Sergeant, their defenses are down.

205
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,790
Send in the rest of our forces.
Attack the airbase!

206
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,870
All units, move out.

207
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,950
Despite Hardcase's flying,
you two saved us all.

208
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,570
That wasn't so tough.

209
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,160
You sure? You looked a little green
when you came out of that fighter.

210
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:17,420
Captain. Report. What is our situation?

211
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:23,050
General, we have taken the base and
cut off enemy supply lines to the capital.

212
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:28,800
Luck has smiled on you today, Captain.
Consider yourself fortunate.

213
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,560
It wasn't all luck, sir.
A lot of men died to take this base.

214
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,230
The price for such victory.
Perhaps someday you'll realize this.

215
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,610
Dismissed.

216
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,160
He's the one who will never realize.
