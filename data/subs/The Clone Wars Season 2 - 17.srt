1
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:20,313
The death toll rises!

2
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:24,394
As the battles intensify and threaten
a growing number of Republic worlds,

3
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,395
planets are left to survive on their own

4
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:29,915
while the Jedi struggle
to fight a war on many fronts.

5
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:32,236
A series of medical stations
have been established

6
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:34,396
as a lifeline for those in need.

7
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,038
But the facilities are easy prey
for Separatist attacks.

8
00:00:38,118 --> 00:00:41,558
After losing contact
with the medical station orbiting Felucia,

9
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:46,599
Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker
and Ahsoka Tano are sent to investigate.

10
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,521
That's Felucia, dead ahead.

11
00:00:51,602 --> 00:00:54,762
But where's the medical station?
I don't see anything on my scanners.

12
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:57,042
Wait, there's something.

13
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:04,645
- Vulture droids.
- Hang on!

14
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:14,367
I guess we know what happened
to the medical station.

15
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:18,929
- That's not good!
- They took out the plasma conduit!

16
00:01:26,931 --> 00:01:30,572
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Almost certainly not.

17
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:33,652
Looks like we're doing this the hard way.
Starting ejection sequence.

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,973
How come every time you fly, we crash?

19
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:41,654
It's not my fault. It's the ship.

20
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:45,416
Ready to eject.
Wait...

21
00:01:46,337 --> 00:01:47,336
Now!

22
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,579
He always blames the ship.

23
00:02:13,944 --> 00:02:17,304
- You all right there, Master?
- I'm fine, Anakin.

24
00:02:18,025 --> 00:02:20,465
Where on Felucia do you think we are?

25
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:21,865
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:24,146 --> 00:02:27,546
- I don't like the sound of that.
- And I don't like the look of that.

27
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,389
We don't want to scare them.

28
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,350
We can't just wander around aimlessly.
We need a plan.

29
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,311
You always taught me to go on instinct,
and my instincts tell me to go that way.

30
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:48,312
Well, that doesn't seem right.
I think we should go this way.

31
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:51,433
Why do you even ask for my
opinion? You never do things my way.

32
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,113
We crashed the ship your way.

33
00:02:53,194 --> 00:02:56,954
Very funny. I see your sense of humor
survived the landing.

34
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:00,716
- It's about the only thing.
- Uh, if you two are done arguing,

35
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:03,476
I think there's some smoke on the horizon.

36
00:03:03,557 --> 00:03:06,517
Which means people,
and a way off this planet.

37
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:20,360
Look. There's a village.

38
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:22,402
Maybe they have a ship we can borrow.

39
00:03:33,205 --> 00:03:37,205
- Hmm, they're growing healing herbs.
- Nysillim, I believe.

40
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:39,165
One of the most valuable crops
in the galaxy.

41
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:51,889
- This place looks deserted.
- I don't believe it is.

44
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:59,731
Well, there's one thing I learned
where I grew up.

45
00:03:59,812 --> 00:04:01,971
If you want to know what a farmer's up to,

46
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,652
look in their barn.

47
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:11,214
This is an odd ship for farmers.

48
00:04:11,295 --> 00:04:13,495
Perhaps someone's here
to pick up the sillim.

49
00:04:13,575 --> 00:04:16,735
I still don't get it. Where is everyone?

50
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:41,062
- Mystery solved.
- They're terrified.

51
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,583
It's okay, we won't hurt you.

52
00:04:45,184 --> 00:04:48,304
Kindly drop your weapons, Jedi.

53
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:51,464
Take it easy, Snips.
We don't want any trouble.

54
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:56,106
It's not always about the numbers.

55
00:04:56,387 --> 00:05:01,467
Four on one is hardly a fair fight,
even for a Jedi.

56
00:05:01,829 --> 00:05:05,628
Wait a minute, four on one?
You mean four on two.

57
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,430
We don't count you, knee-high.

58
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:10,830
Do you count me?

59
00:05:16,673 --> 00:05:21,313
Stop! Don't harm them!
Can't you see these are Jedi?

60
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:23,633
- We are saved!
- Saved?

61
00:05:24,034 --> 00:05:27,954
Need I remind you, Casiss,
you already made a deal with us?

62
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:32,796
- But with the Jedis' help...
- Excuse me, but help you with what?

63
00:05:34,277 --> 00:05:35,516
Pirates.

64
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,639
Simply stated, if we don't give
the pirates a portion of our crop,

65
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:48,000
they will destroy our homes
with us in them.

66
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,240
Hmm, I see your dilemma.

67
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:54,961
Sillim farming is a meager trade.
Without our herbs to sell,

68
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:59,283
we will have no money for food,
fuel or equipment.

69
00:05:59,604 --> 00:06:01,843
And yet you can afford
to pay mercenaries?

70
00:06:02,205 --> 00:06:07,245
These bounty hunters drive a far more
reasonable bargain than the pirates.

71
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,246
- Why not just fight them yourselves?
- Easy for you, perhaps.

72
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:16,608
But look at us.
We are farmers, not warriors.

73
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:21,048
Even with the bounty hunters' help,
I had feared the worst.

74
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,449
But now, there are seven of you.

75
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,010
What do you want, Jedi?

76
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:29,930
We need a ship.
Ours is beyond repair, I'm afraid.

77
00:06:30,172 --> 00:06:32,092
The one in the barn, that'll do.

78
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:36,132
That's our ride.
It doesn't go anywhere without us.

79
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,213
And right now, we're busy.

80
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:40,093
Busy extorting farmers?

81
00:06:40,175 --> 00:06:42,614
I don't hear you offering to help.

82
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:47,015
Unfortunately, we couldn't help
even if we wanted to.

83
00:06:47,337 --> 00:06:48,455
What?

84
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:54,817
Master, these farmers are in trouble.
Why can't we help them?

85
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:57,578
Believe me, Ahsoka,
I would like nothing more.

86
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,819
However, we need to report that
the medical station has been destroyed.

87
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,979
If we stay too long,

88
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,980
the Separatists will show up
looking for us here.

89
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:06,101
- But...
- Better they get robbed by pirates

90
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:08,301
than attract the interest
of General Grievous and his horde.

91
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:11,822
Pirates! Pirates, pirates!
The pirates are back!

92
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:24,585
That's far enough.
I speak for the people of this village.

93
00:07:26,107 --> 00:07:27,786
State your name and business.

94
00:07:28,027 --> 00:07:32,748
My name is my own business.
And my business is taking what's ours.

95
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:36,829
There is nothing here that's yours.
Unless you're here to buy it.

96
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,150
Buy it?

97
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,150
Kenobi. Skywalker!

98
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,311
I can't believe
you came all this way to see me.

99
00:07:48,353 --> 00:07:49,832
- Hondo.
- Hondo.

100
00:07:49,993 --> 00:07:53,072
- You know each other?
- Of course we do.

101
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:56,474
Tell them how far back we go, Kenobi.

102
00:07:56,955 --> 00:07:58,474
Too far, I'm afraid.

103
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:01,915
And here I thought
we were friends.

104
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,276
If you're truly interested
in friendship, Hondo,

105
00:08:04,357 --> 00:08:07,236
might I suggest
you stop threatening these farmers?

106
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,917
Threatening them?

107
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,198
Oh, please tell me you have not been
listening to this bounty-hunting scum.

108
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,279
Scum? We're just here
to help them protect what's theirs.

109
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,641
Oh, come, come, my dear.
How much are they paying you?

110
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:27,602
Bububub! Does not matter.
Whatever it is, I will double it.

111
00:08:27,963 --> 00:08:31,043
And all you have to do to earn it is, uh,

112
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:35,845
- step aside.
- We don't break deals.

113
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:43,127
- Steady, everyone.
- What is your stake, anyway, Kenobi?

114
00:08:43,447 --> 00:08:46,327
All we want is a ride
to the nearest Republic outpost.

115
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:48,968
And I'm willing
to pay you handsomely for it.

116
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:51,048
Twice what you could make
selling this crop.

117
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:54,209
Well, um, how do you plan to pay me?

118
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,330
- A funds transfer when we arrive.
- Republic credit?

119
00:08:58,691 --> 00:09:03,772
We've been over this before, Kenobi.
My associates don't accept that currency.

120
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:06,492
I'm offering a deal
that benefits us all, Hondo.

121
00:09:06,574 --> 00:09:09,454
Don't let your greed blind you to that fact.

122
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:11,654
You know, I like you, Kenobi,

123
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,736
but no one leaves this planet
until I get my sillim.

124
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,376
Then I hope you enjoy it here,

125
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:22,497
because you'll be staying
a long time, parasite.

126
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:27,538
You know,
this crop has not been harvested.

127
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:33,139
You better hurry, old man,
before things start to die on you.

128
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,463
When the attack comes,
it will come from two fronts.

129
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,463
The forest to the south,
and the ridge to the north.

130
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,545
Whatever you do,
you must defend both sides.

131
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,705
But there are only four of them.

132
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,146
How can four bounty hunters
defend against so many?

133
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:03,547
The farmers are right.
These bounty hunters don't stand a chance.

134
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,428
We've been over this, Anakin.

135
00:10:05,469 --> 00:10:09,149
You seem to lack confidence
in our abilities, young Jedi.

136
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,870
I'm sure you're good at what you do,
but you are in way too deep.

137
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:16,391
Said the peacekeeper
who fails to keep the peace.

138
00:10:16,512 --> 00:10:18,592
The rift in the galaxy is not our fault.

139
00:10:18,713 --> 00:10:21,632
If more worlds would stand up
for themselves against the Separatists,

140
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:24,393
this war would have been over long ago.

141
00:10:24,514 --> 00:10:27,914
That's it! We'll just train the villagers
to defend themselves.

142
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,475
But we are just simple farmers.

143
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:33,155
Why are we paying bounty hunters
to defend us

144
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:36,196
if we are just going to end up
doing it ourselves?

145
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:40,237
- Hush, Dilanni.
- Trust me. We'll have you ready.

146
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,241
Put it in the barn. Every bushel.

147
00:10:55,883 --> 00:10:57,642
All right, everyone, form up.

148
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,362
Um...

149
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,603
Divide into rows of five.

150
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:12,366
I told you, we are not soldiers.
We don't even have weapons.

151
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:16,047
May I?

152
00:11:30,052 --> 00:11:31,651
Yep, these will do.

153
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:38,332
What happens if you need the barn
as a fallback position?

154
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:41,414
With all the sillim here, it will be difficult
to squeeze the farmers in.

155
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,774
There's room.

156
00:11:43,895 --> 00:11:46,535
I worry that you care more
for the safety of the sillim

157
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:48,696
than you do for the safety of the villagers.

158
00:11:48,776 --> 00:11:52,616
You think I'm only worried about my profit.
Is that it?

159
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,657
The thought had crossed my mind.

160
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,938
So, in your mind,
I'm just like any other pirate.

161
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:04,300
- Am I wrong?
- Not entirely.

162
00:12:04,741 --> 00:12:08,061
But it is easier to protect the villagers
and the sillim

163
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:11,261
- if they're both in the same place.
- Then might I suggest...

164
00:12:11,343 --> 00:12:14,822
You might suggest anything you like,
General Kenobi.

165
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:18,624
But I know what I'm doing,
and I will keep these people safe,

166
00:12:18,944 --> 00:12:20,224
my way.

167
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,991
Seripas! It's too heavy!

168
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:54,393
Seripas?

169
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:59,635
Don't look!
I'm having a suit malfunction.

170
00:13:08,717 --> 00:13:13,038
- Not very intimidating, am I?
- You don't have to look tough to be tough.

171
00:13:20,961 --> 00:13:23,000
I thank you for your help.

172
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:51,688
The bounty hunter is right.

173
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,609
Every minute you waste
teaching us to twirl these stupid poles

174
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,130
is time you could have spent
beating those pirates yourself.

175
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:00,971
And what good would that do you?

176
00:14:01,052 --> 00:14:03,771
Another band of brigands
would inevitably come along.

177
00:14:03,812 --> 00:14:07,612
Or do you intend to give away
part of your crop every harvest season?

178
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:11,534
If you make us do this,
there won't be another harvest season!

179
00:14:14,735 --> 00:14:18,375
All right, everyone, get back in position.
Let's continue.

180
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:31,298
Well, what have we here?
Getting ready for a fight, are we?

181
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:37,420
There! A scout!

182
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,342
Embo!

183
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:16,791
Quick work.

184
00:15:18,192 --> 00:15:19,791
Yes,

185
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:24,792
but when this scout fails to report
to Hondo, he'll be coming, soon.

186
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:34,796
The scout has not checked in
from the village. He's long overdue.

187
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:40,717
Well, well, well. So it looks like the Jedi
are getting involved, doesn't it?

188
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:45,398
Or, at least we now know
we can't take these villagers for granted.

189
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,039
But you know what I always say.
"Speak softly

190
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,720
"and drive a big tank. "

191
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:59,602
The farmers are in position.
Well, the ones who stuck around, anyway.

192
00:15:59,683 --> 00:16:02,283
Very well, Anakin. Turn on the fence.

193
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:08,444
Battle positions, everyone!

194
00:17:25,626 --> 00:17:26,745
Embo!

195
00:17:30,387 --> 00:17:31,986
Embo, can you hear me?

196
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:34,347
You'll be all right. We'll get you inside.

197
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:38,828
Everyone, fall back to the barn!

198
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:43,389
That tank is going to tear
the villagers apart.

199
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:50,872
Get him inside.
We'll hold them off as long as we can.

200
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,512
Die, Jedi scum!

201
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,041
- No!
- Sugi! Watch your flank!

202
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:54,088
Your situation is hopeless, Skywalker.

203
00:19:06,092 --> 00:19:09,213
- Welcome back, Dilanni. Are you all right?
- Fine.

204
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:27,377
The Captain!

205
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,657
Let's go!

206
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,260
The day is won!

207
00:19:37,181 --> 00:19:38,420
Help me!

208
00:19:41,502 --> 00:19:45,021
Skywalker, let me call off my men.

209
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:05,667
This effort is no longer profitable!

210
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:20,831
There are crops to harvest,
fields to till, huts to rebuild.

211
00:20:21,593 --> 00:20:23,552
Now, let's get to work.

212
00:20:25,113 --> 00:20:28,673
How can I ever thank you
for saving our village?

213
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:32,034
We didn't save your village, Casiss.
Your people did.

214
00:20:32,515 --> 00:20:37,435
For the first time in my memory,
my people don't have to be afraid.

215
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:40,277
We will never forget you.

216
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,238
I seem to find myself light on company.

217
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,159
Still need that ride
back to the Republic outpost?

218
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:52,279
If it wouldn't be any inconvenience.

219
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:55,560
On the contrary, it would be my pleasure.
