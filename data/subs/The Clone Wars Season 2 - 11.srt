1
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:19,962
War creates opportunities
for the criminal underworld!

2
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:22,882
Ruthless mercenaries conspire
with the Separatists

3
00:00:23,003 --> 00:00:26,881
to disrupt and exploit
the unstable situation within the Republic.

4
00:00:27,003 --> 00:00:29,562
Now, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano

5
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:32,001
descend into the treacherous
gangster havens

6
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,601
in an effort to find a corrupt
and vile arms dealer

7
00:00:34,682 --> 00:00:36,761
who is buying weapons
on the black market

8
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,482
and selling them
to the Republic's enemies.

9
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:56,760
Car Affa is an arms dealer selling
Republic weapons on the black market.

10
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,119
- Who is he selling them to?
- The Separatists.

11
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:02,880
According to intelligence,
he's inside this joint.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,839
You stay here in case he tries to escape.

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,640
Just like always.

14
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,278
Hey!

15
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,278
My lightsaber.

16
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,398
Hey!

17
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,958
My master's gonna kill me.

18
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,077
This isn't happening.

19
00:01:52,758 --> 00:01:54,597
- Where were you?
- I...

20
00:01:54,677 --> 00:01:58,516
I was checking out a suspect.
I had a bad feeling about him.

21
00:01:58,598 --> 00:02:01,877
- And?
- It was nothing. False alarm.

22
00:02:01,917 --> 00:02:03,797
Well, come on, then.

23
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:19,955
Master?

24
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:23,995
Is it all right if I go to the library
and do some research?

25
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:26,435
Sure. I'll take care of our little friend here.

26
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:36,754
I'm sure if you explain your loss
to your master, he'll understand.

27
00:02:37,076 --> 00:02:43,035
No. He tells me over and over,
"Your lightsaber is your life. Don't lose it. "

28
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:47,394
There has to be a better way
to find this thief.

29
00:02:47,474 --> 00:02:51,394
I'm sorry.
Pickpockets aren't my field of expertise.

30
00:02:51,475 --> 00:02:54,033
At this rate, it'll take me years to find him.

31
00:02:54,115 --> 00:02:57,714
I might have another idea. There.

32
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:01,954
That is Tera Sinube. He's an elder Jedi.

33
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:06,993
He happens to be an expert
on the Coruscant crime world.

34
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:09,233
- I think he's sleeping.
- Yes.

35
00:03:10,353 --> 00:03:13,112
Well, he will be able to help you.

36
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:16,672
Uh, pardon me, Master Sinube?

37
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:18,273
What? Who?

38
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:22,352
I was just resting my eyes.

39
00:03:23,313 --> 00:03:27,791
- Hello, Master Sinube.
- Good morning, Jocasta.

40
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,312
I don't know you, do I?

41
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,671
My name is Ahsoka Tano.
I was told you could help me.

44
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:45,952
I could tell he definitely came
from one of the aquatic planets.

45
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,671
You know, one of the water worlds.

46
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:52,191
So you're saying
there was something fishy about him?

47
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:02,030
Well, let's try and see if we can find out
where he went, shall we?

48
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:05,790
We were near the slum district, G17.

49
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:09,749
Where would he go, your little pickpocket?

50
00:04:10,191 --> 00:04:14,349
To a gangster hangout?
Unlikely, but possible.

51
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,109
Maybe the gun market
to sell the lightsaber.

52
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,229
Within the radius.
Just a moment, let me see.

53
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,589
He was a Patrolian. That's a fish guy.

54
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,588
Maybe...

55
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,228
Is it one of these fishes?

56
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:33,228
- That's him!
- Interesting indeed.

57
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,949
According to the file,
his name is Bannamu, a petty thief.

58
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,108
He hangs out in the slum district.

59
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,468
Thank you, Master Sinube.

60
00:04:41,549 --> 00:04:43,628
- I'm sure...
- Your help has been invaluable.

61
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,868
- Well, you're welcome.
- If there's anything I can do...

62
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:50,388
Yes, there is.
I haven't been on assignment in years.

63
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,468
And if you don't slow down,

64
00:04:53,869 --> 00:04:56,748
you're not going to find
what you're looking for.

65
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,546
I'll come with you.

66
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:03,187
Okay, gramps.
It would be nice to have company.

67
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,667
Splendid!

68
00:05:19,546 --> 00:05:21,066
Can I help you?

69
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:24,345
We're looking
to buy a lightsaber.

70
00:05:24,427 --> 00:05:26,506
Any ideas where we could do that?

71
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,905
Come with me.

72
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,945
So, you wanna buy a lightsaber?
How much are you willing to pay?

73
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:44,745
If you have it, you'll give it to me.

74
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:48,305
What my little friend is saying
is how much?

75
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:51,944
- Twenty thousand.
- Twenty thousand?

76
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:55,024
It's a rare weapon, a Jedi weapon.

77
00:05:55,625 --> 00:06:00,744
- Do you have the item with you?
- No. But I can get it.

78
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:04,344
- From him?
- Hey, who are these guys?

79
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:08,744
- They are Jedi!
- And if we are?

80
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,143
I don't want to get mixed up with Jedi.

81
00:06:11,225 --> 00:06:13,703
We were just doing our old friend
Bannamu a favor.

82
00:06:14,064 --> 00:06:17,783
Well, I think it's time you forget about him
and do me a favor.

83
00:06:17,864 --> 00:06:19,783
That's my lightsaber he stole.

84
00:06:21,104 --> 00:06:23,543
Well, that makes a difference.

85
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,902
What do you want me to do?

86
00:06:26,024 --> 00:06:28,462
I want you to tell me where he is.

87
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:33,462
I hope you remember this
and someday do me a favor.

88
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:37,782
He's not that far away.
He's at the Spider Arms Hostel.

89
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,981
- May I help you?
- We know where we're going.

90
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:55,502
You know where you are going.

91
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,821
We must be careful
not to warn him.

92
00:06:58,862 --> 00:07:01,420
But, Master, we don't know
where we're going.

93
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:04,741
He could be
in any one of these rooms.

94
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:09,140
- You need to be more quiet, young one.
- Okay, okay.

95
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:13,580
Not quiet with your mouth.
Quiet with your mind.

96
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:19,300
You're so anxious to find this pickpocket
that your worry is equal to his.

97
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,939
You mean, if I relax,
I can sense Bannamu's anxiety?

98
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:30,498
Yes. If you relax,
you would realize he's in this room.

99
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,539
Well, well, Bannamu, I assume.

100
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,699
Who are you? What do you want? Hey!

101
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:45,898
My lightsaber, you slimy thief.
I want it back. Now!

102
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:51,338
I no have it! I swear! I got rid of it!

103
00:07:51,778 --> 00:07:55,418
I almost killed myself with that thing.

104
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,218
- What did you do with it?
- No, no.

105
00:07:57,259 --> 00:07:59,017
I don't recall.

106
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,177
- You little...
- Ahsoka!

107
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:05,897
It's not smart to steal from a Jedi.

108
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:09,617
You're looking a little too young
to be a Jedi.

109
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,816
Come on! Okay, okay, okay.

110
00:08:14,978 --> 00:08:19,297
His name is Movers, yes, Nack Movers.

111
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:21,737
Nack Movers?

112
00:08:21,858 --> 00:08:25,737
He's a very dangerous one,
well-known in the underworld.

113
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:30,496
Yes! Exactly! Yeah, I sell it to him.
Yeah, yeah.

114
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,096
You should be afraid.

115
00:08:33,176 --> 00:08:37,175
I got a good price.
He was very, very motivated.

116
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,335
You can find him with his girlfriend.

117
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:43,615
She has a place
on the upper east side of Happyland.

118
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:46,175
I bet he's there now. He's always there.

119
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:49,695
- You can stop talking now.
- Okay, I shut up.

120
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:52,774
Well, at least you know
where your lightsaber is.

121
00:08:52,896 --> 00:08:57,254
Yeah. It's in the hands of a killer.
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

122
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:05,214
- Master, we've got to hurry.
- Patience, young one.

123
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:09,533
You worry that if people die
at the hands of your lightsaber,

124
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:14,853
that you will be as guilty for their death
as the one that strikes the blow.

125
00:09:15,615 --> 00:09:21,053
A valid concern, young one,
and one for you to puzzle out.

126
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,373
What? What is it?

127
00:09:26,174 --> 00:09:28,973
I believe we've reached our destination.

128
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,173
Oh, no.

129
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:40,092
- Let me guess. Nack Movers.
- A reasonable assumption.

130
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:41,532
He's dead.

131
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,771
- Are they gone?
- Who's gone?

132
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,652
The men who killed Nack.

133
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,611
- Who are you?
- lone Marcy.

134
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,691
I came home and found him here like this.

135
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:01,531
lone, did you call for help?
Why were you hiding?

136
00:10:02,252 --> 00:10:03,691
I was afraid.

137
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,011
She seems terrified.

138
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:16,730
And yet,
I sense something else is troubling her.

139
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:18,410
I'll search the other rooms.

140
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:42,849
Time to die!

141
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:46,008
- How does this work?
- My lightsaber!

142
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:47,689
You're a Jedi?

143
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,967
Master Sinube, you're right.

144
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:17,527
I found the intruder
and she has my lightsaber.

145
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:21,367
She's a Terellian jango jumper
and hard to keep up with.

146
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,726
So the assailant is a female?

147
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:56,885
Aha! That's it!

148
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:14,044
I am sure my little friend
will catch up to your intruder.

149
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:15,923
You have nothing to worry about.

150
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,324
Right. Of course.

151
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,683
Your friend Nack
wasn't a very good fighter, was he?

152
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:38,603
- Or maybe he was poisoned?
- What?

153
00:12:38,683 --> 00:12:42,603
Well, obviously,
he's come to an unfortunate end.

154
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:46,683
He'd be stronger than the average man,
though, wouldn't you say?

155
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,482
I guess.

156
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,522
Hmm.

157
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:04,002
You said a group of men
killed your friend Nack Movers.

158
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:08,441
And yet, my Padawan
described the assailant as a female.

159
00:13:08,882 --> 00:13:11,522
There was a group of them.
I didn't get a good look.

160
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:15,361
I also contacted the authorities
to come here

161
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:18,121
and help you with your unfortunate friend.

162
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,800
Oh.

163
00:13:20,402 --> 00:13:22,080
You're very kind.

164
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,197
I have no doubt

165
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,438
the Jedi are doing their very best

166
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,318
to ensure the safety of every citizen
in the Republic.

167
00:14:13,239 --> 00:14:16,997
The accusations
that the Jedi created the Clone War

168
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:21,037
to give themselves more power
over the government is absurd,

169
00:14:21,118 --> 00:14:23,436
and I will not stand for it.

170
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,517
You should have a seat.

171
00:14:27,397 --> 00:14:30,117
You might have been distraught before,

172
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:33,917
but ever since the intruder
left your apartment,

173
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:36,396
you've become even more nervous.

174
00:14:37,157 --> 00:14:41,996
I'm upset. This whole ordeal
I just endured, it's upsetting.

175
00:14:42,397 --> 00:14:45,436
...Count Dooku
and his droid armies.

176
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:50,796
To support the Jedi's efforts in the war,
I ask the Senate to pass these new laws

177
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:54,635
giving more jurisdiction
to planetary security.

178
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:03,835
Or is there a reason
you might be concerned?

179
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:14,474
You weren't afraid
because you were in danger.

180
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:18,915
You were afraid we would find your friend
hiding in the other room.

181
00:15:18,955 --> 00:15:21,154
You're in league with the bounty hunter!

182
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,914
Arrest her!

183
00:15:31,714 --> 00:15:35,153
Off she goes. Always rushing.

184
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:38,993
Cassie, the Jedi know I'm involved.
I had to run.

185
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:41,513
Just get over to J Street and pick me up.

186
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:27,950
- I see you've learned patience, young one.
- Where did you get that speeder?

187
00:16:28,031 --> 00:16:32,070
I asked one of the police droids
to lend me some transportation.

188
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,830
They were kind enough to oblige.

189
00:16:43,831 --> 00:16:48,789
Hey! You're driving too slow.
We need to go faster.

190
00:16:48,871 --> 00:16:52,669
Patience. We'll cut them off
at the train station.

191
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,910
How do you know they're headed there?

192
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,269
Did I mention I planted a tracking
device on lone, the girl that ran away?

193
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,948
No.

194
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,066
Stop them!

195
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:54,785
Halt. Halt. You're under arrest.

196
00:18:17,626 --> 00:18:22,664
You ran off in such a hurry.
I trust you didn't mean to be rude.

197
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:24,944
I have nothing more to say to you, Jedi.

198
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:28,783
Well, perhaps you meant
to be a little rude.

199
00:18:50,703 --> 00:18:55,222
You're trapped. Surrender now
and turn the lightsaber over to me.

200
00:18:55,304 --> 00:18:57,022
Don't tell me what to do.

201
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,022
I've got a lightsaber,
and I'm as powerful as a Jedi.

202
00:19:07,183 --> 00:19:08,623
I'll trade myself for them.

203
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:12,982
You know how much I'm worth to the Jedi.
It's a good deal.

204
00:19:13,462 --> 00:19:16,862
All you have to do is let them go.

205
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:23,982
Once we're alone, you'd use
some kind of Jedi Force trick on me.

206
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,742
No deal. These two stay with me.

207
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:29,100
And you, you stay out of my way.

208
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,699
For a guy that moves slow,
you always seem to get ahead of me.

209
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,620
The value of moving slowly is that
one can always clearly see the way ahead.

210
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:20,059
Well, I best be getting back
to my master before he misses me.

211
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:24,738
Certainly. But first,
I need one last favor from you.

212
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,258
- Sure. Name it.
- Pass on what you have learned.

213
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:40,417
- Hello, old friend.
- Greetings, Master Sinube.

214
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:44,017
Padawan Tano,
a lesson you have for us today, hmm?

215
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:47,217
- Yes.
- A lesson in patience.

216
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:51,297
Gather round, younglings.
Listen to the Padawan, you shall.

217
00:20:53,177 --> 00:20:58,136
This weapon is your life,
but it is also your responsibility.

218
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,496
Don't let it out of your sight.
