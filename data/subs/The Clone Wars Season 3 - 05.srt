1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,990
Desperate times on Mandalore!

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,950
Having won neutrality
for the Mandalorian system,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,790
Duchess Satine now finds herself
an outsider with little aid to her people.

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,100
Supplies are impossible to come by,
except on the black market.

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,090
As a result, the Duchess
faces a world consumed by greed.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,650
Hoping to alleviate some of the tensions
rising in the capital city of Sundari,

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,680
Satine has called upon her friend
Padmé Amidala

8
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,980
to make a diplomatic visit.

9
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,290
Senator.

10
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,790
Duchess. It's good to see you.

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,300
Thank you for coming, Padmé.

12
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,260
I know our decision to stay neutral
has caused distress in the Senate.

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,470
But for many here, the fallout
from your war has been too much.

14
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:24,260
If your government has trade concerns,
we can talk.

15
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,970
Many systems have been affected.

16
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,520
I assure you, not everyone in the Republic
has neglected Mandalore.

17
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:35,650
And there are those of us who would still
vote to give you any help you require.

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,360
The help we need now is opening trade
routes so we may get supplies more freely.

19
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:43,200
We are making progress in the Senate.

20
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,380
Forgive me, Padmé, I did not
bring you here to discuss politics.

21
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,040
I had hoped to show you
the new Mandalore.

22
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,460
Not the typical Mandalorian welcome.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,300
Senator Organa teased
you'd have a royal court waiting.

24
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:01,720
I just wanted to greet you myself
before the others.

25
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,360
Now, this is a Mandalorian welcome.

26
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,170
We are a people of tradition.

27
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,820
Hurry up. Get that stuff unloaded quickly.

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,080
Here comes the customs official.

29
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,920
Nice day here on Mandalore.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,630
It is, let's try not to ruin it.

31
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,890
I don't get your meaning.

32
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,970
Oh, I think you do.

33
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,890
Your arrival isn't listed here
on my schedule.

34
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,320
So what exactly are you unloading
on my dock?

35
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,900
Must be a clerical oversight.

36
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,520
I'm sure it won't happen again.

37
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:44,320
Normally, there would be five times
as many officers out here.

38
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,910
They're off at the parade.
Some big shot just arrived on Mandalore.

39
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,040
You're lucky.

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,580
Luck has nothing to do with it.

41
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,210
Well, just in case, deal with
me directly in the future. Got it?

42
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,510
As you wish.

43
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,020
Esteemed colleagues,
leaders of Mandalore, friends,

44
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,900
I'm afraid our neutrality
has caused our people to suffer.

45
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:23,780
The war between the Separatists and
the Republic rages across our galaxy.

46
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,700
It has caused trade routes
to be closed to Mandalore.

47
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,580
And has forced us to turn
to a black market filled with corruption.

48
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,790
We know what is happening, Almec!
What will be done about it?

49
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,080
Mandalore should not need
to pay smugglers to feed its people.

50
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,340
It's not that we want to deal
with smugglers, we have no alternative.

51
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,300
I'm sure you and the Trade Federation

52
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,130
make a profit
whether our business is legitimate or not.

53
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,640
I resent that!

54
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,100
Ladies and gentlemen, please!
Order! Please!

55
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,180
Prime Minister Almec
seems a bit overwhelmed.

56
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,100
If you're volunteering your services
as a negotiator, please be my guest.

57
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,070
Perhaps they will listen to a new voice.

58
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,940
Ruling council! May I speak?

59
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,240
Senator Amidala.

60
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,950
The floor is yours.

61
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,750
I hear your worries, your frustration.

62
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:17,960
But the longer you argue,
the more your people suffer.

63
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,250
You are right,
new trade routes are essential to survival.

64
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,050
But the black market is no substitute
for legitimate and legal trade.

65
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,550
What would you propose, Senator?

66
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,680
The Republic can provide security.

67
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,640
The Republic's own dealings with
the black market far surpass Mandalore's.

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,220
I agree. It's quite hypocritical
of you to come here,

69
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,150
a member of the Republic Senate,
and lecture to us about corruption.

70
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,810
Mandalore cannot protect its...

71
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,320
The black market is essential
to our survival.

72
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,740
The corporate alliance
controls every nation!

73
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,320
Silence!

74
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,660
I told Senator Amidala
that Mandalore was not part of the war.

75
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,620
Yet, here I find a battle in my own palace.

76
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,050
I call this meeting adjourned.

77
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,750
We will reconvene
and allow cooler heads to prevail.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,030
Come on, you worms,
get those barrels inside.

79
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,730
What is this stuff?

80
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,030
This "stuff" is slabin, a diluting agent.

81
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,830
If we add it, we can make twice
as much tea at twice the profit.

82
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,910
Isn't it toxic?

83
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,500
Only if the dosage is wrong,
so get your mixture right.

84
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,850
Tell me, Padmé.

85
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,480
How do you feel about the Republic's war
with the Separatists?

86
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,730
It's so complicated.

87
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,020
As you know, in the Senate,
the Chancellor says it's going very well.

88
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,360
But my sources say otherwise.

89
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,620
And how does that make you feel?

90
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,950
There are times
I wish I could follow Mandalore's lead.

91
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,330
Neutrality, and not just in the war.

92
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,540
But the politics as well?

93
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:26,040
The contamination of greed
reaches deep and far within the Republic.

94
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,550
Corporations, trade guilds,

95
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,420
too many senators serving
their own interests.

96
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,900
There are still those of us
who work to overcome the corruption

97
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,010
and believe it to be possible.

98
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,770
Enough of this dreary talk.
A new hospital has opened.

99
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,810
Tomorrow, you and I shall visit,
see true good at work.

100
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,560
It will do us good.

101
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,010
- Orderly, what's going on here?
- I have no idea, Madam.

102
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,380
Dr. Zaz is handling the outbreak.
He's inside.

103
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,910
What is happening here?

104
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,630
Duchess, I'm sorry
no one has come to speak to you.

105
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,550
- These children have been poisoned.
- How?

106
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,050
We don't know.
And it's not just here, I'm afraid.

107
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,270
We've gotten reports
from across the planet.

108
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,140
Have you identified a cause?

109
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,560
Well, the children here
all came from the same school.

110
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,270
We're testing their food.

111
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,440
If we find something,
perhaps we can create an antidote.

112
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
But it will take some time.

113
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:14,820
Which they may not have.

114
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,700
What if it's not a poison?
It must be Death Watch.

115
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,580
I'm not so sure.
In the past, the Death Watch attacks

116
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,580
have only been directed at myself
and the administration, not the children.

117
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,410
They are terrorists.

118
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,080
Perhaps the senator's visit
has inspired them.

119
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:34,250
Terrorists? Our minds should be on the sick
children that are dying in the streets.

120
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,010
What are you going to do to save them?

121
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,470
I must speak to the ruling council
about this matter.

122
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,020
I refuse to believe that Death Watch
has anything to do with this.

123
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,640
I agree. And his
concern for the children...

124
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,520
Was practically none.
All he thinks about is politics.

125
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,940
Well,
we can't just sit here and do nothing.

126
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,900
My thoughts exactly.

127
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,450
Thank you all for coming.

128
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,120
I suppose you're wondering
why I asked you here.

129
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:06,830
As my personal guards, you are the only
ones I can trust to investigate this matter.

130
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,290
We have little time.
That is why I've asked for your help.

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,420
Padmé.

132
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,420
Each of you will be getting
a special comlink and datapad,

133
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,350
means of direct communication
and locations you should investigate.

134
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,680
This must be a closed-loop affair.

135
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,930
Hundreds of children have been poisoned.

136
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,600
They are our children.

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,430
And they need our help.

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,930
This is a Mandalorian matter,

139
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,440
and we must find out
who dares poison our children.

140
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,610
Thank you. Thank you all.

141
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,070
- So where do we start?
- The schools.

142
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,580
Thank you for allowing us
to inspect the school, Superintendant.

143
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,790
My pleasure, Duchess.

144
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,000
We've cleared the food here.
None of it is tainted.

145
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,010
What about what they ate yesterday?

146
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,380
The menu of food is pretty regular here.

147
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,640
We would've caught something
with our tests.

148
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,600
- What about their drinks, Doctor?
- No, they drink fresh water.

149
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,770
It's impossible for it to be tainted.

150
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,980
Not the water.
What about the bottled drinks?

151
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,150
Those are not part of the school's menu.

152
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,650
They are allowed
through an outside vendor.

153
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,860
Excuse me, child.
I must borrow your drink.

154
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,050
- How could this have happened?
- It's not your fault.

155
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:46,470
I appreciate that. However,
for an outbreak of this size to occur...

156
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,650
I'm afraid it's a sign
of a much, much deeper-seated corruption

157
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,810
than I had imagined.

158
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,680
Duchess, we've found something.

159
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,370
This tea contains a high level of slabin.

160
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:00,820
I didn't know slabin was lethal.

161
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,990
It usually isn't, but mixed with
the tea and at this concentration,

162
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm certain
it's the cause of the children's illness.

163
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,990
The school must have
an import log, correct?

164
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,830
Yes, I believe so.

165
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,670
So we should be able to find out
where the tea came from.

166
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,380
Well, then let's get to the docks.

167
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,010
Everything is here, Satine.

168
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,720
Everything except the records
for the tea shipments.

169
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,890
It looks like the school's import log
has been erased.

170
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,230
There's no record of an outside vendor.

171
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,100
Superintendent? Hold it right there!

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,570
I'm actually on my way to the hospital.
I have to go.

173
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,690
Stop him!

174
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,910
Tell me what's going on here

175
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,120
or else my guards will not be
as conversational as I am.

176
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,370
- Satine!
- Padmé, please.

177
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,710
Where did you get the tea?

178
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,420
Please, I never meant to harm anyone.
I just...

179
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,760
I needed to cut costs.
The school's budget was too low.

180
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:12,060
The school has received
sufficient government funding.

181
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:18,900
Look, they offered me a great deal.
I could keep some money for myself, too.

182
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,310
But I didn't know
that the drinks were poison.

183
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,570
All this because you were greedy?

184
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:27,240
I'm not the only one making money
off this operation. There are others.

185
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,740
More guilty than I am!

186
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,420
Was Death Watch involved?

187
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,740
Death Watch?

188
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:36,550
I don't know, I dealt with a middleman.
An importer. His name's Siddiq.

189
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,540
He works for a shipping company
not too far from here.

190
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,420
Tell us where.

191
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,590
Sure I bribed the school official.
What's the problem?

192
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,590
What you've done is illegal.

193
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,430
Beyond these stars,
there's a war going on.

194
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,260
As long as my company imports goods,

195
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,140
most people turn a blind eye
to anything else.

196
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,940
We are not most people, Mr. Siddiq.

197
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,900
My corporate contracts
protect me, Duchess.

198
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,610
So I'll play your little game.

199
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,460
Look, I'm sorry there are sick children.
I truly am.

200
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,950
But I'm just a messenger.

201
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,950
Where do you get the tea?

202
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,830
From Mooga,
the Commerce Guild controls it.

203
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,290
Here, I've nothing to hide.

204
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,460
Here we are,
shipping schedules from Mooga.

205
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,250
Right there, the highlighted ones.

206
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,130
And a customs official reports these
to the government?

207
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,340
As far as I know.

208
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,760
Are these all for the ones
bringing in the tea?

209
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,680
No. I'd have to narrow that down.

210
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,680
Okay, okay, no problem.

211
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,640
There you go. Look, they're actually
bringing in a shipment tonight.

212
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,810
You want to know which dock?

213
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:56,330
I must say, when I came to visit, I hadn't
pictured us in such an informal setting.

214
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,330
Yes, well,
from what Master Kenobi tells me,

215
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,540
during your tenure as Queen, you became
quite familiar with such excursions.

216
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,340
One can only survive the rigors
of courtly formalities for so long.

217
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
We are of the same mind.

218
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,850
Duchess, there's a shipment arriving.

219
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,360
- The smugglers.
- We'll soon find out.

220
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,030
Shall I call in more security?

221
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,360
No, let's wait and see what transpires.

222
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,870
Look, a customs official.

223
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,550
Welcome back, gentlemen.
I'm here for my inspection.

224
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,050
Certainly. We would expect nothing less.

225
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,860
How can they operate with such impunity?

226
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,090
I need to find out how far up the chain
of command this corruption goes.

227
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm sorry, Duchess,
but what you're saying, it's impossible.

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,290
Impossible? We witnessed it
with our own eyes.

229
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:31,590
Bribery of a customs official
at the shipping docks? I'm afraid not.

230
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,430
The docks are a highly secure area.
Free of dangerous criminals.

231
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,340
But not free of corruption.

232
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:40,760
The most dangerous weapon in the galaxy
is money, Captain.

233
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,930
Smuggling does not take place
on my watch.

234
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,940
And what about
when you're not watching?

235
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,150
I'm always watching, Senator.

236
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,440
And were you watching as children
were dying? Who was watching then?

237
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,610
- Duchess, with all due respect...
- No, Captain!

238
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,620
If you want my respect, you will arrest
these criminals and stop stalling.

239
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,830
Stalling?

240
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,460
Why else would you not be down there
with a patrol unit making arrests,

241
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,460
unless you're involved?

242
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,170
All right, we'll see what's going on.

243
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,560
Satine, what are those guards doing here?

244
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,390
Did you order them here?

245
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,310
Duchess, I've been with you
the whole time.

246
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:36,110
Guards, let us into this warehouse.

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,650
We're under strict orders
not to let anyone in.

248
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,370
- Do you know who this is?
- I command you, open these doors!

249
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Um...

250
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,880
Arrest them!

251
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,020
Hold it right there!

252
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,790
Impressive shooting for a senator.

253
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,090
Captain, I want you to burn down
this warehouse.

254
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,590
- Excuse me? But there's evidence...
- Burn it down,

255
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,010
or I'll consider you
a part of this conspiracy, Captain.

256
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,270
You heard her, men. Burn the warehouse.

257
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,290
It wasn't Death Watch, Prime Minister.

258
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:01,670
It was a group of black market smugglers.
They were diluting the drink with slabin.

259
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,010
What they didn't count on was the process
would make the drinks poisonous.

260
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,840
And what about the sick children?

261
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,560
I ordered shipments of the antidote
for all the schools and hospitals.

262
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,560
- I'm glad this is over.
- No, I'm afraid it's not over.

263
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,810
The corruption
we witnessed is intolerable.

264
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,730
Payoffs, police unwilling to comply,
my government fooled!

265
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,070
How does this happen?

266
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,070
I'm sorry.
I'm setting up a committee to look into it.

267
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,080
Children nearly died because
our government cannot be counted on.

268
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,990
I assure you this will not go unpunished.

269
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,250
I'm counting on you, Almec.

270
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm troubled, Padmé.

271
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,680
You heard Prime Minister Almec say
he'll investigate.

272
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,720
His heart is in the right place,
but this corruption...

273
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:53,390
- You must have hope, Satine.
- Hope will only go so far.

274
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,480
The very people conducting
this investigation might be corrupt.

275
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Perhaps a Jedi working undercover at
the academy could be of service to us,

276
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,250
and in more ways than one.

277
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:09,030
For if we lose our young,
Mandalore will indeed be lost.

278
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,370
I will speak with Master Yoda.
Don't lose hope, my friend.

279
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,830
- Senator.
- Duchess.
