1
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:20,730
<i>Jedi form rebel alliance!</i>

2
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,860
<i>Led by Anakin Skywalker,</i>

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,230
<i>the Jedi have trained a band of rebels</i>

4
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,600
<i>to fight the Separatists
on the planet Onderon.</i>

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,770
<i>With the help of the Jedi,
the rebels escape capture</i>

6
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,246
<i>and infiltrated the heavily
fortified city of Iziz.</i>

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,970
<i>Now our heroes
have launched an armed campaign</i>

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,140
<i>to subvert the Separatist
occupation of the planet.</i>

9
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:44,150
<i>The Jedi Council
continue to observe and advise</i>

10
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,250
<i>as the rebels strive to gain momentum</i>

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,420
<i>against the Separatist forces.</i>

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,050
<i>Despite the absence
of civilian casualties,</i>

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,720
<i>public fear has ensued</i>

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,996
<i>as reports
of the rebels' daring strikes</i>

15
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,320
<i>circulate throughout the city.</i>

16
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,540
Your identification failed.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,740
That's not possible.

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,170
You are coming with us.

19
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,210
Hey!

20
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,880
- What's going on?
- No!

21
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,070
The rebels are attacking again.

22
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,380
That is the fifth time this rotation.

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,350
That should give King Rash
something to think about.

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,250
Huh, I'm sure
you've gotten his attention.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,406
Dendup has been summoned
and awaits your order, my lord.

26
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,000
What about the terrorists?

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,310
They've attacked
a checkpoint near the canal

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,570
and two droid patrols,

29
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,610
one in Malgan Market.

30
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,570
If they think destroying a few droids

31
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,210
is going to effect change,
they've run a fool's errand.

32
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,120
One more thing, my lord.

33
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,380
The royal carriage was ambushed

34
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,656
soon after it left the residence.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,620
Hmm, an attempt on my life.

36
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,550
It appears that way.

37
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,360
Get my predecessor in here.

38
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,630
You surprise me.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,010
Engaging with extremists
is beneath you.

40
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,340
Do you really want
your crown back that badly?

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,590
I only want freedom for my people.

42
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,850
Hmm.

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,510
Your supporters are responsible
for terrorist acts

44
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:44,010
against the kingdom and our allies.

45
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,950
I didn't know that.

46
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,996
You've made it quite impossible
to stay informed of anything

47
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,420
outside my prison chamber.

48
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,490
Call off the attacks.

49
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,630
I cannot call off
what I did not dictate.

50
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,500
What you are up against

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,000
is simply the will of the people.

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,870
It's up to the king
to embrace, bend, or break it.

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,700
And I am no longer the king.

54
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,300
Stop the attacks,

55
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,210
or you will atone with your life.

56
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,780
It is you that must end the attacks

57
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,950
by ending the droid occupation.

58
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,880
Your success will not go unnoticed.

59
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,890
I agree, but we need to be
mindful of public perception.

60
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,960
What was your observation, Padawan?

61
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,560
The people were fearful, Master.

62
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,930
Indeed.

63
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,030
Judging from the reactions
I saw today,

64
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,330
I'm afraid they will mistake
your intentions.

65
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,840
We need to do more damage.

66
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,170
A few dozen broken-down droids
will do little to free Onderon.

67
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,770
The people need to believe
we can succeed.

68
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,210
Without their support,
our efforts are meaningless.

69
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,380
If they're afraid,
they won't support us.

70
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,780
We need to assure them
of our intentions.

71
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,150
I don't understand.
Why are they afraid?

72
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,810
They're afraid
we're not strong enough to win.

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,850
We need to earn their trust.

74
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,650
You'll have plenty of time
to earn their trust.

75
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,490
All of you are going to be very busy.

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,820
Today was only a taste.

77
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,690
You'll get your chance.

78
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,400
In the meantime,
make the most of your victories.

79
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,860
Welcome and learn from them.

80
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,360
Perhaps if we hit something big,

81
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,330
gave a show of strength,

82
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,630
they will overcome their fear
and join us.

83
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,630
Do you have something in mind?

84
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,570
I know the perfect target.

85
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,910
I think they're ready to give
the 501 some competition.

86
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,310
Let's not get carried away, General,

87
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,756
though these rebels have impressed me.

88
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,480
We will share the developments
with the Jedi Council.

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,426
Ahsoka will remain here as an advisor.

90
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:41,020
Monitor them and report back
with their progress.

91
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,720
Are you up for it, Snips?

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,360
Or would you like
to return to Coruscant?

93
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,520
No, Master.

94
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,860
I want to stay.

95
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,190
Good.

96
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,260
We should continue
to provide supplies and credits,

97
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,306
but they must learn
to operate on their own.

98
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,460
Their survival depends on it.

99
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,330
Yes, Master.

100
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,370
Remember your purpose.

101
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,310
This power generator feeds
substations across the city.

102
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,690
We hit that, the entire grid falls.

103
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,280
How does that help us?

104
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,020
Battle droids are no longer
linked to central control.

105
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,890
They operate individually.

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,720
Yes, but they still need power
to recharge.

107
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,366
If we take out this facility,

108
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,190
it will knock out the power grid,

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,830
and then it will only be
a matter of time

110
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,360
until the droid army
is brought to a standstill,

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,530
literally.

112
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,330
If you carry the plan out
by nightfall,

113
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,070
you'll maximize
your strike capability.

114
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,630
Okay, so we just need to figure out

115
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,970
how to destroy the power station.

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,100
We need to do more surveillance.

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,310
Those droids should have
all the intel we need

118
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,610
stored up in those tin cans
of theirs, right?

119
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,910
They should.

120
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,510
Then I'll get us one.

121
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,960
Hey, clanker.

122
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,070
Uh-oh.

123
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,150
Sentries at every access point,

124
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,910
inside and out.

125
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,010
We can't sustain combat
against their numbers.

126
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,950
But our size makes us perfect
for mobility and surprise.

127
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,280
We need something with heavy firepower

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,650
if we are to blow up this facility.

129
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,490
If we give them enough trouble,

130
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,790
they'll call for reinforcements.

131
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,120
Like a tank.

132
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,360
Exactly.

133
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:14,430
Then you can provide cover
while we hijack it.

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,660
And then we use
their own weapon against them.

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,270
And we bring the droid army
to its knees.

136
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,720
Shh.

137
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,950
Remember the plan.

138
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,190
We attack this patrol,

139
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,020
and hopefully they will
call in a tank for backup.

140
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,510
Ah!

141
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,580
Let's go.

142
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,720
Patrol 118 to central.

143
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,120
We've been ambushed by terrorists

144
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,020
and need reinforcements.

145
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,230
Let's hope they send a tank.

146
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,230
Hear that?

147
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,500
They've sent destroyers.

148
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:48,570
Move!

149
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,940
We're not gonna last unless
we take out those destroyers.

150
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,450
We have to get behind them.

151
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,480
Let's go.

152
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,660
Roll it slow so it gets through.

153
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,770
I know that.

154
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,840
Nice job.

155
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,200
You screwed me up.

156
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,280
Thanks.

157
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,720
I've never seen a destroyer
taken out that way before.

158
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,290
We all have to adapt.

159
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
There's our tank.

160
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,770
Split up.

161
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,630
Let's move.

162
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,390
Good work.

163
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,520
Now, let's get this thing
up and running again.

164
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,700
What are you waiting for?

165
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,070
Give me a second.

166
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,430
Do you know what you're doing?

167
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,940
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.

168
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,570
You boys having a problem?

169
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,640
No. No problem. Why?

170
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,740
Well, come on.
We need to get moving.

171
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,580
Hey, who put you in charge?

172
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,640
All right.

173
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,380
Get out of the tank, hotshot.

174
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,440
This needs a woman's touch.

175
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,580
Fine. Be my guest.

176
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,390
We need to get to that power generator

177
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,726
before they realize
this tank's gone missing.

178
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,820
We're running out of time.

179
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,950
I was gonna do that.

180
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,190
Uh-huh. Sure.

181
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,630
Couldn't have done it better myself.

182
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,430
Now, that's the truth.

183
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,760
I'll draw their fire.

184
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,790
Good luck.

185
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,860
Good luck.

186
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
I'll cover you.

187
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,090
We're almost in position.

188
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,620
Ready when you are, Steela.

189
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,190
A sniper. Get her.

190
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,020
Roger, roger.

191
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,140
Look. We have reinforcements.

192
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,710
Hey, you're not a droid.

193
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,450
Get down from there.

194
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,830
Fire the gun.

195
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,440
The gun is recharging.

196
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,010
You're all clear.

197
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:57,760
Looks like all that training
is paying off.

198
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,570
My lord, without power,
the droids will be massacred.

199
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,470
This loss will work for us.

200
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,580
There's been a power outage.

201
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,450
I've lost contact with command.

202
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,920
Switch to infrared.

203
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,330
Aah!

204
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,936
- It's the rebels.
- Fight for Onderon!

205
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,230
They're destroying the droids!

206
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,960
- Free Onderon!
- Freedom!

207
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,200
Fight for freedom!

208
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,560
Get the droids!

209
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,230
Freedom! Freedom!

210
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,250
For freedom! For Onderon!

211
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,656
- Yeah!
- Yes!

212
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,410
For freedom! For Onderon!

213
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:22,160
Show those droids what we're worth.

214
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,830
We must celebrate.

215
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,390
With pleasure.

216
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:33,500
Come here, you handsome senator.

217
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,840
<i>Steela is a born leader.</i>

218
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,310
<i>And quite courageous, I hear.</i>

219
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,340
<i>Ahsoka, remember what I told you</i>

220
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,140
<i>about staying focused.</i>

221
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,040
I can't help it, Master.

222
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,310
<i>I understand.</i>

223
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,650
You do?

224
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,650
<i>I do.</i>

225
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,150
<i>But try to remember,</i>

226
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,820
<i>always put purpose
ahead of your feelings.</i>

227
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,120
<i>This latest development</i>

228
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,520
<i>will surely get
Count Dooku's attention.</i>

229
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,920
<i>He will respond harshly.</i>

230
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,096
<i>They will stop at nothing to find you.</i>

231
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,490
<i>You must adapt
and continue to confront them</i>

232
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,290
<i>in order to liberate Onderon.</i>

233
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,307
We will.

234
00:19:11,331 --> 00:19:12,760
And we shall win.

235
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,870
<i>In that, I have no doubt.</i>

236
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,160
<i>Now you must rally the people.</i>

237
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,160
<i>You will need their support.</i>

238
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,660
<i>Your ability to influence them</i>

239
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,430
<i>will also determine
your capacity to represent them</i>

240
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,470
<i>not only on the battlefield
but off of it</i>

241
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,940
<i>against your enemies,
even within your own ranks.</i>

242
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,240
<i>Your commitment will inspire others.</i>

243
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,710
<i>Your conviction will lead to victory.</i>

244
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,050
<i>After tonight's efforts,</i>

245
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,780
<i>the people will be ready to follow.</i>

246
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,820
<i>You will need a leader
for them to rally behind.</i>

247
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,460
They are waging a very public war.

248
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,620
Every trespass is an embarrassment.

249
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,460
<i>Your forces cannot manage
a small band of terrorists?</i>

250
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,800
My lord, your droids
have become ineffective

251
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,130
against the mounting rebel attacks.

252
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,970
<i>I thought I could trust you
to rule Onderon.</i>

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,010
<i>I find this report most disappointing.</i>

254
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,010
It seems that the rebels
are far more organized

255
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,780
than they were in the past.

256
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,750
The attack against the power
generators proves that.

257
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,750
Perhaps it's time you send me
better reinforcements

258
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,550
than the droids I have.

259
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:26,920
<i>I will grant you this request</i>

260
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,590
<i>and not only send you better droids</i>

261
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,550
<i>but a better general.</i>

262
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,260
<i>This is Kalani.</i>

263
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,730
<i>I assure you he will succeed
where you have failed.</i>

264
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,460
We need to build on our momentum

265
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
and continue our attacks
to keep them off balance.

266
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,676
We have to assure the people first.

267
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,440
If we keep disrupting their lives,

268
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,340
we risk alienating them.

269
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,740
We have to gain their trust.

270
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,450
I agree with both of you.

271
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,310
We can balance both.

272
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:01,456
We also need to recruit others
to join us.

273
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,350
Onderon is ours.

274
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,080
We will remind everyone

275
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,680
and keep reminding them

276
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,350
until we get it back.

277
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,950
- Onderon is ours!
- Onderon is ours!

278
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,120
- Free Onderon!
- Onderon!

279
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,750
For freedom!

280
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,930
All in favor of Steela as our leader,

281
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,360
raise your hand.

282
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,276
Okay.

283
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,670
Looks like it's been decided.

284
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,470
You're the leader.

285
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,900
Saw.

286
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,000
Let him go.

287
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,486
He just needs to blow off some steam.

288
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,470
He'll be back.

289
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,070
I can't.

290
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:43,980
Why?

291
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,910
He's my brother.
