1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:21,167
Fugitive! Though the Republic
has won many decisive battles

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,410
against the Separatist army
in the Outer Rim,

3
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:27,337
the Jedi have failed
to capture the elusive General Grievous.

4
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:31,983
After specifically targeting members
of the Jedi Council, a trap was set,

5
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:34,226
but following a fierce confrontation,

6
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,673
the droid general managed to escape
to the surface of the planet Saleucami.

7
00:00:38,753 --> 00:00:40,395
Now the chase is on

8
00:00:40,476 --> 00:00:43,439
as General Kenobi leads a squadron
of clone troopers

9
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:46,244
and closes in on his desperate target.

10
00:00:51,172 --> 00:00:55,417
We must find a way off this planet
before they find us.

11
00:00:56,339 --> 00:01:00,744
Kenobi! We need to hurry
and find an escape pod.

12
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:08,396
Instead of scattering our troops
looking for all the escape pods,

13
00:01:08,476 --> 00:01:11,079
we shall head towards the wreckage
of the landing transport first.

14
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:17,048
Contact the fleet.

15
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,252
Sir, our transmitter is destroyed.

16
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:24,419
There is only one escape pod
that survived.

17
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,347
We must get there as quickly as possible.
Let's hope the transmitter is still intact.

18
00:01:30,428 --> 00:01:33,071
Now, find me some transportation.

19
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:52,499
General Kenobi!
Sir, the cruiser's returned to orbit.

20
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,705
- Any sign of Grievous?
- I believe we've found Grievous' ship.

21
00:01:57,548 --> 00:02:00,431
Power low.

22
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:03,915
The power is...
I can't go on.

23
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:07,040
Sir, we need to get our power recharged.

24
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:12,448
Not this again. How could your power cells
be so depleted?

25
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,813
You would not let us ride
on one of those creatures with you, sir.

26
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:18,096
If you would allow us to close down
for a few...

27
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,781
Any more complaints?

28
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:24,185
- No. Nope. No.
- No. I don't think so.

29
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:26,228
That's what I thought.

30
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:28,832
Now, let's find that pod.

31
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:31,035
Yikes.

32
00:02:36,844 --> 00:02:41,049
Thermal housing intakes are still warm.
This couldn't have happened too long ago.

33
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,372
The crew compartment's
almost entirely destroyed.

34
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,175
We'll split into teams.

35
00:02:45,296 --> 00:02:48,100
Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase and Kix
and search those wetlands.

36
00:02:48,221 --> 00:02:48,884
Yes, sir.

37
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,464
Crys and I will pick it up
from here.

38
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:55,408
And, Rex, if you get a visual on Grievous,
contact us before you engage.

39
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:04,581
- Rex is a smart man.
- Indeed. Always thinking on his feet.

40
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,871
These droids are too gone
to give us any good intel.

41
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,239
Here's one!

44
00:03:41,836 --> 00:03:43,477
Take the shot.

45
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,683
Protect the Captain!

46
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,742
Commando droids.

47
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,671
Jesse, you better get back here.

48
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,203
What do you have?

49
00:04:15,324 --> 00:04:18,246
We've broken the access codes and
powered up the droid's guidance system.

50
00:04:18,368 --> 00:04:19,648
According to his memory logs,

51
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,571
he fired the emergency thrusters
on the escape pod

52
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:23,214
to avoid a midair collision.

53
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,377
- Collision with what?
- Another escape pod.

54
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:27,620
There was no time to correct
for the steeper glide path,

55
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:29,783
which is why this droid's pod crashed.

56
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:32,267
Can you pinpoint the landing zone
for the other pod?

57
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,510
I can put us
within two to three clicks of it, sir.

58
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:37,195
Alert the men. We've picked up the scent.

59
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:40,158
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

60
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,882
I need to remove his armor
to see the full extent of the damage.

61
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:45,006
Those snipers might have called
for backup.

62
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:47,209
Unless we want
to start getting picked off one by one,

63
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,331
- we should find better cover first.
- Mmm-hmm.

64
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:54,138
Wait a minute.
Those critters are domesticated.

65
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,343
- Sir?
- I think we're on farmland.

66
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:01,028
And where there's a farm,
there's usually a farmer.

67
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,431
Let's find his homestead.

68
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,498
We want no trouble here.

69
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:25,423
Easy with that weapon, ma'am.
We're here as friends.

70
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:28,067
- State your business.
- Our captain's been hurt. We need...

71
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,551
- I'm no doctor, so just...
We have a medic, ma'am.

72
00:05:30,632 --> 00:05:32,915
We just need a place
to tend to him overnight.

73
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:35,679
- Mommy, who's...
- Get back inside, both of you!

74
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,000
Oh!
Mom!

75
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,764
Look, there are some benches
out back in the barn.

76
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:42,769
- It's the best I can do.
- That'll be fine, ma'am. Thank you.

77
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,901
What... What happened?

78
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:52,623
Commando droids took a potshot.

79
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:56,308
That would've gone straight through your
heart had it been two inches to the left.

80
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,313
- I can't move my arm.
- You have some nerve damage.

81
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:03,559
Understood. Now patch me up,
and let's get on with it.

82
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,645
Sir, you're in no condition.
It will heal, but it will take time.

83
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:09,767
We're getting
underway, Kix.

84
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:12,972
- That's an order.
- Sir, as the team medic,

85
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,976
when it comes to the health of the men,
including you,

86
00:06:16,018 --> 00:06:17,299
I outrank everyone.

87
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,303
So I respectfully order you, sir,

88
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,346
- to get some...
- Excuse me.

89
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:26,752
- If there's not enough...
- That's plenty. Thank you, uh...

90
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:27,994
Suu.

91
00:06:30,238 --> 00:06:32,681
I told you to stay in the house.

92
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,525
I couldn't help it, Mom. It got away.

93
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:44,098
- You look like my daddy.
- Shaeeah, don't bother the soldier.

94
00:06:44,178 --> 00:06:47,062
- Now get inside with your brother.
- Yes, Mom.

95
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:51,387
My husband is away
delivering our first harvest.

96
00:06:51,429 --> 00:06:54,031
- Do you require anything else?
- No.

97
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,994
- Thank you, Suu.
- Mmm.

98
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:06,289
Resume the search without me.
Jesse, you're in command. I'll be fine.

99
00:07:18,067 --> 00:07:19,989
There's our escape pod.

100
00:07:21,071 --> 00:07:24,556
- Any sign of Grievous?
It looks deserted.

101
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,920
He must be heading
to a second escape pod.

102
00:07:28,963 --> 00:07:31,285
- Captain Rex, come in, please.
- It's Jesse, sir.

103
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:33,929
- Rex was injured.
- What's his condition?

104
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,733
He'll be fine. But we had
to find him shelter for the night.

105
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,858
Grievous is on the move.
We're headed to the west.

106
00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:42,301
Swing around and we can meet up
at the final escape pod.

107
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:45,225
We're going to need all the firepower
we can muster.

108
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,908
Roger that, sir.
We're speeding towards you.

109
00:08:02,091 --> 00:08:04,533
No, no, no, no, no.

110
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,215
We should be there by now.

111
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:38,101
We are, sir,
there almost.

112
00:08:38,223 --> 00:08:42,107
You had better be interpreting
the coordinates correctly.

113
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:44,871
Oh, no.

114
00:08:45,954 --> 00:08:49,479
We're almost there, sir. One click out.
Straight ahead.

115
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,804
I'm losing power.

116
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:30,177
Who are you? What are you doing here?

117
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,303
You're a clone.

118
00:09:34,344 --> 00:09:38,829
So, I see the war has finally made its way
out here.

119
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:42,795
And I guess I can expect a visit
from some droids soon.

120
00:09:42,836 --> 00:09:44,357
What's your number and rank?

121
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,967
My name is Lawquane. Cut
Lawquane. And I'm just a simple farmer.

122
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,569
You're a deserter.

123
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:54,412
Well,

124
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,097
I like to think I'm merely
exercising my freedom to choose.

125
00:09:58,218 --> 00:10:02,544
- To choose not to kill for a living.
- That is not your choice to make.

126
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:05,868
You swore an oath to the Republic.
You have a duty.

127
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,475
I have a duty. You're right.
But it's to my family.

128
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,199
Does that count,
or do you still plan to turn me in?

129
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,561
Do I have a choice?

130
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,644
Daddy, you're home!

131
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:19,248
Look what I drew you, Dad!

132
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:23,134
Well, well, well.
That's great, Jek.

133
00:10:23,214 --> 00:10:24,776
I see you two have met.

134
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:27,540
He looks just like you, Daddy. I told him.

135
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,464
Oh, you did, huh?

136
00:10:30,545 --> 00:10:33,268
I was just making our guest, Captain, um...

137
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:34,510
What's your number?

138
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,474
Rex. I also have a name, believe it or not.

139
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:42,762
He was injured. His men brought him here.
I told them he could stay just for the night.

140
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:46,607
Course he can.
We never turn away those in need, do we?

141
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,732
No, we always help anyone we can.

142
00:10:49,812 --> 00:10:53,177
Right. You, um... You look hungry, Rex.

143
00:10:53,298 --> 00:10:57,984
- No, I'm fine. I'll stay here.
- No, you have to eat with us, please!

144
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,425
- Please! Please!
Please!

145
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,189
They're never gonna stop till you say yes.

146
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:02,750
All right, I'll join you.

147
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,614
Yes, well, you and I may be clones,
but we're still individuals.

148
00:11:19,736 --> 00:11:22,939
You have a name rather than a number,
Captain. Why is that?

149
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:26,665
Perhaps our leaders feel it's
a more efficient way of distinguishing us.

150
00:11:26,706 --> 00:11:28,868
More efficient than a number?

151
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,472
I doubt the Kaminoans think that way.

152
00:11:31,553 --> 00:11:34,636
Still, a name has to make you feel unique.

153
00:11:34,678 --> 00:11:37,521
Especially in an army where everyone
looks like you and talks like you...

154
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:40,084
Actually, I've never really thought about it.

155
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:42,608
- Yes, you have.
- Well, how would you know?

156
00:11:42,689 --> 00:11:46,974
Because I am as close to you
as any life form can be.

157
00:11:48,938 --> 00:11:52,061
I've seen how you look
at my family, our home...

158
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:56,949
Come on, Rex, admit it. You've thought
about what your life could look like

159
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,714
if you were to also leave the army,
choose the life you want.

160
00:12:00,796 --> 00:12:03,358
What if I am choosing the life I want?

161
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,563
What if I'm staying in the army
because it's meaningful to me?

162
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,886
And how is it meaningful?

163
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:12,771
Because I'm part of the most pivotal
moment in the history of the Republic.

164
00:12:12,893 --> 00:12:15,896
If we fail,
then our children and their children

165
00:12:15,977 --> 00:12:19,421
could be forced to live
under an evil I can't well imagine.

166
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:21,624
If you were to have children, of course.

167
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,989
But that would be against the rules,
wouldn't it?

168
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,472
Isn't that what somebody
programmed you to believe, Captain?

169
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,956
No, Cut, it's simply what I believe.

170
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:33,121
It doesn't matter if it's my children
or other people's children.

171
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:35,084
Does that meet with your approval?

172
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:38,289
Perfectly. To each his own.
That's what I always say.

173
00:12:38,369 --> 00:12:39,891
What does that mean, Daddy?

174
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:42,935
It means you can do anything
with your life that you want to.

175
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:51,547
- How are you doing, Jesse?
- Closing in, sir. We have a visual.

176
00:12:51,908 --> 00:12:54,031
Very well, we'll meet you in the middle.

177
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,725
- Is your transmitter working?
- I don't know. I haven't used it yet.

178
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,328
All right, I'll check on it.

179
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,412
Stupid battle droids!

180
00:13:08,693 --> 00:13:10,334
Sir, you made it.

181
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,496
Get back in the pod

182
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:15,021
and send out a distress signal
to what's left of our fleet.

183
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:18,306
We need to get a shuttle
down here immediately.

184
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:20,910
Roger, roger, but I must inform you, sir,

185
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:24,875
there are multiple life forms approaching
from the east and west.

186
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,237
Battle positions!

187
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:32,286
Good move. Very good move.

188
00:13:32,928 --> 00:13:36,773
- So what was it?
- What made me decide to leave the corps?

189
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:40,938
Shortly after the Battle of Geonosis,

190
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,304
our troop transport got caught
between two Separatist gunships.

191
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:47,348
They fired on us with everything they had.
We crashed.

192
00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:50,192
Most of us were either dead
or severely injured.

193
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,917
So when they started working their way
through the wounded, killing us off,

194
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,601
I knew there was no hope. I ran.

195
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,886
It still haunts me.

196
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:01,769
I'm sorry.

197
00:14:02,411 --> 00:14:05,454
It's the day I felt
my life didn't have any meaning.

198
00:14:05,495 --> 00:14:08,779
Everyone I cared about,
my team, was gone.

199
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:13,306
I was just another expendable clone
waiting for my turn

200
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:15,869
to be slaughtered in a war
that made no sense to me.

201
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,312
Can you understand that, Rex?

202
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:23,119
I've been in countless battles
and lost many brothers.

203
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,763
They were my family, my home.

204
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:34,456
Daddy, we finished our chores.
Can we go outside and play?

205
00:14:34,577 --> 00:14:35,578
Please.

206
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,743
- Okay, only for a few minutes.
- Thank you, Daddy! Come on, Jek.

207
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,386
Okay.
- And keep the house in view.

208
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,507
We will.

209
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,511
You have wonderful children.

210
00:14:45,473 --> 00:14:47,916
I know you think I'm a coward, Rex.

211
00:14:48,037 --> 00:14:52,282
But believe me, I'll fight to my last breath
to keep them safe.

212
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,168
Fire!

213
00:15:06,343 --> 00:15:07,584
Tank two! Port side!

214
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:11,430
Great shot!

215
00:15:11,951 --> 00:15:13,352
Where is that ship?

216
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,321
Shaeeah? Where are you?

217
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:25,770
Shaeeah, where are you?
Stop fooling around.

218
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:27,092
Boo!

219
00:15:27,173 --> 00:15:30,337
- You're not funny.
- Am too!

220
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,664
- Look. In the field.
- What is it?

221
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,150
It wasn't there before.

222
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:42,073
It's some kind of spaceship, I think.

223
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:43,916
Hello?

224
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:46,079
Hello?

225
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:48,323
Do you think
somebody's in there?

226
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,833
Uh-oh.
I didn't do it. You did it.

227
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:12,758
Run!
Run!

228
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:18,486
- Run! Run! Run!
- Monsters! Run! Run!

229
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,812
Monsters!

230
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,898
- Shaeeah? Jek? What's wrong?
- Monsters! They're chasing us!

231
00:16:26,979 --> 00:16:29,341
What monsters, honey? Where?

232
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:33,067
They hatched from the big egg in the field!

233
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:40,197
Ah. This is not good. I count 20.

234
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:43,642
- Cut, what's out there?
- Commando droids.

235
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:44,924
What are they doing?

236
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:48,409
- Suu, get the kids upstairs.
- Come. Come, children. Come now!

237
00:16:51,855 --> 00:16:53,416
What weapons do you have?

238
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,382
We can catch them in a crossfire.
You take that corner.

239
00:16:57,464 --> 00:17:00,747
No, Captain.
With respect, you're not in charge here.

240
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:01,949
I can be useful.

241
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,474
Sir, you're injured.
You have only one good arm.

242
00:17:06,356 --> 00:17:08,638
- But I can fight.
- So can I.

243
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,325
Rex, I need you
to be the last line of defense for my family.

244
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:20,496
- I'll take care of them.
- Thank you.

245
00:17:49,018 --> 00:17:50,059
Finally!

246
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,065
General Grievous, sir. We see you
below us. Are you ready to depart?

247
00:17:56,028 --> 00:17:58,630
Concentrate your fire on that ship!

248
00:18:01,475 --> 00:18:04,559
Hey! They're shooting at us!
Coming back around.

249
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:09,967
Sir, that ship's coming around
for another landing attempt.

250
00:18:10,008 --> 00:18:12,490
Keep firing! Don't let that ship land.

251
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:15,615
- The guns are overheated!
- Always something.

252
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,658
Cody, Jesse, cover me.

253
00:18:18,621 --> 00:18:20,783
General, behind you!

254
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,309
Rex, they're coming for you!

255
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:22,912
Daddy? Daddy?

256
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:26,558
I'm okay. It's over.

257
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,320
No!

258
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:37,212
Forget trying to land.

259
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:45,425
Fire the engines.

260
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:50,472
Jedi scum!

261
00:19:53,477 --> 00:19:57,482
- Are you all right, sir?
- No. We're right back where we started.

262
00:19:58,004 --> 00:20:00,487
Call the cruisers.
See if they can stop that ship.

263
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:01,648
Right away, sir!

264
00:20:01,689 --> 00:20:04,251
And tell them to send someone
to pick us up.

265
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,864
All right, that should do it.

266
00:20:12,905 --> 00:20:16,430
Captain Rex, are you going
to turn in my husband?

267
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,953
I'm sorry, Suu, it's my duty.

268
00:20:20,356 --> 00:20:23,600
But in my condition,
I probably won't remember any of this.

269
00:20:23,721 --> 00:20:25,082
Thank you.

270
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:28,567
You're still a deserter, Cut,
but you're certainly not a coward.

271
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:30,530
Captain Rex,
are you still with us?

272
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:34,495
Yes, General Kenobi. I'm still with you
and thankfully on the mend, sir.

273
00:20:34,537 --> 00:20:37,540
That's great news.
We certainly missed you at the party.

274
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:40,745
Sorry, sir. I had to attend one of my own.

275
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:43,308
Can't wait to hear about it.
We're standing by.

276
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,995
- You're welcome to stay, Rex.
- This is your home, Cut.

277
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,359
My family is elsewhere.

278
00:20:51,481 --> 00:20:53,082
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

279
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,973
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
