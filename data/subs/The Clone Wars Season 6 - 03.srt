1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,490
Cause ofdeath unknown!

2
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,040
Kaminoan Doctor Nala Se was unable

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,250
to find the cause of an illness
in Clone Trooper Tup.

4
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,880
In a desperate attempt
to save his friend's life,

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,880
Fives located and removed a tumor
from Tup's brain

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,840
with the help of medical droid AZI-3.

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,970
Immediately following the procedure,
Tup died,

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,800
and Fives was placed under arrest.

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,470
Now, the tumor is the only hope
to finding answers

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,730
for Tup's mysterious illness.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,990
General, what did the Chancellor say?

12
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,790
Supreme Chancellor Palpatine
wants the tumor

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,540
and all of the intel gathered

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,080
sent to the Grand Republic
Medical Facility on Coruscant.

15
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,210
So, then I'll be going
to Coruscant as well?

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,260
You were not a part
of the Chancellor's request.

17
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,760
I'm sorry, Fives,

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,680
but this is a matter best left
to the medical professionals.

19
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,400
There is still so much we do not know.

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,270
Perhaps we would know more

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,440
if this clone had not taken matters
into his own hands.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,900
Listen! I was trying to save my friend!

23
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,780
And yet perhaps by removing
this tumor, it was you who killed him.

24
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,280
What do you care?

25
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,120
You were going to kill him anyway,
and dissect him, too.

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,330
He's a soldier. He deserves better!

27
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,920
Stand down, Fives!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,210
Doctor, there is no proof of your claim.

29
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,590
I want this specimen and all the data
prepared for transit to the Jedi Temple.

30
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,970
The Chancellor said the tumor and data

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,810
was to be sent directly
to the Medical Facility on Coruscant,

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,610
not the Jedi Temple.

33
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,400
And it will get there,

34
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,980
but after the Jedi have run
an analysis on it first.

35
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,780
I protest. I must personally deliver
the tumor to the Chancellor as ordered.

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,410
You can protest all you want.

37
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,700
My word is final.

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,840
You have one more physical to pass.

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,590
If you are cleared,
you will be sent back to the 501 st.

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,760
Thank you, General.

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:50,110
It will be good to put this
entire incident behind you, Trooper.

42
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,940
I agree.

43
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,790
AZI-3!

44
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,840
Hello, ARC Trooper Fives.

45
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,670
I regret that we were
unable to heal your friend.

46
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,970
Yeah, me, too.

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,550
Are you going to be
reprogrammed as well?

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,600
No, AZI, I'm going back to the front.

49
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,640
That is not what I heard.

50
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,940
I heard your mind was going to be wiped

51
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,730
and that you would be reassigned here
and placed on sanitation detail.

52
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,560
We can still be friends,

53
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,440
assuming we both remember each other

54
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,400
after our memories have been erased.

55
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,870
Let's go, CT-5555.

56
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,410
No!

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,420
Look what you did!

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
I cannot believe what you did!

59
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,930
I am not getting my mind erased,
and neither are you.

60
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,770
Get out of here!

61
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,430
Are we escaping?

62
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,740
Why are we here?

63
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,290
I knew it!

64
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,830
Nala Se switched the cases.

65
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,370
She's trying to hide something.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,300
Oh, the tumor?

67
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,290
So we are going to
continue our research?

68
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,540
Yeah, the research, that's it.
Now come on!

69
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,130
Whoa!

70
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:13,580
I'm sorry, sir. All ships are locked down
during the emergency.

71
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,200
- Oh? What about that one?
- Hey!

72
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,380
There they are!

73
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,260
Sorry, brother.

74
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,110
I want him brought in alive!

75
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,740
- Have that ship tracked.
- Yes, ma'am.

76
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,120
Can you float?

77
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,120
I am buoyant
and have several survival modes.

78
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,790
Ah! Survival, eh?

79
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,260
Autopilot
engaged. Navigation and orbit set.

80
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,640
Wait! What are you doing?
I thought we were escaping?

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,970
Nope, this is a diversion.

82
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,430
I need them to chase this pod

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,890
while we go back and investigate
the cause of Tup's death.

84
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,440
Any more questions, Doctor?

85
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,770
Actually, yes, now that you mention it...

86
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,410
AZI! AZI!

87
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,910
Now what?

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,830
We're going back to figure out
why Tup died.

89
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,500
I can get us there much faster.

90
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,760
Oh! You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

91
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,260
This is one
of my various survival modes.

92
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,520
I am equipped...

93
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:02,100
Droids.

94
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,350
A "thank you" would have been nice.

95
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:19,620
Lord Tyranus, you summoned me?

96
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,430
Prime Minister Lama Su tells me
there has been a complication.

97
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,090
What has happened
to the inhibitor chip?

98
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,880
It was stolen by a renegade clone.

99
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,270
What does this clone know?

100
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,930
Nothing as of yet.
He is just a soldier, after all.

101
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,680
However, he was a friend

102
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:41,150
to the clone which malfunctioned.

103
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,350
This behavior is unsettling.

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,690
First the malfunctioning clone
and now a renegade.

105
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:52,030
Are you certain these soldiers
will live up to your design in the end?

106
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,120
I am certain. The malfunction to
the inhibitor chip is an aberration.

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,450
And how do you explain the renegade?

108
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,500
I'm afraid the Jedi have inspired
creative thinking in some of the clones.

109
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,170
That is the cause of this type
of divergent behavior.

110
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,590
Will this interfere with Protocol 66?

111
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,520
No, I am certain of that.

112
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,760
Find the renegade clone immediately

113
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:21,560
and make sure you recover the chip.

114
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,020
The true nature of the inhibitor chip
must not be discovered by the Jedi.

115
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,200
Yes, Lord Tyranus.

116
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,500
What... Oh.

117
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,800
Once we're inside, I need you to
get me a change of clothes, AZI.

118
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,640
Trooper, I think I saw the renegade
clone head into the storage room.

119
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,980
All right, let's check it out.

120
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:11,860
I think he was over there.

121
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,490
We need to
get the tumor analyzed.

122
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,590
Follow me.

123
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,880
This is the Genetic Records Hall.

124
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,260
It contains data on the original DNA
of every being we have ever cloned.

125
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,010
We will compare the tumor's DNA

126
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,890
versus that of Jango Fett,
the original donor.

127
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,860
If any tumor like this has been
noted before, we will find it.

128
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,060
The tumor, please?

129
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,990
- Nothing.
- What?

130
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,990
The sample doesn't match anything
found in the Jango Fett genotype.

131
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,950
Furthermore, it is not
even completely organic.

132
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,750
It is foreign to the body.

133
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,830
Someone implanted it there.

134
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,460
An implant?
You mean this isn't an accident?

135
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,640
- Someone did this to Tup?
- Precisely.

136
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,300
There have been no unauthorized ships
leaving Kamino, General.

137
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,520
I sense we are looking
in the wrong place.

138
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,400
We have a report
from the Genetic Records Hall.

139
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,730
Explain.

140
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,530
Someone is accessing
the Jango Fett genotype.

141
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,070
It's them.

142
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,240
Evacuate that room quietly.

143
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,790
Is there another way out of here
besides the door we came in?

144
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes, there are emergency
access hatches in every major room

145
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,210
in case of flooding.

146
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,800
Good, let's get moving.

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,050
There.

148
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:37,090
It's no good.
They've sealed it from the inside.

149
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,170
Station your men at every access point
back into the main hallway system!

150
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,380
Yes, ma'am.

151
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,486
Did you get
all the information you needed?

152
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,890
Mostly. We know that the tumor
is a foreign material

153
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,350
and was implanted
for an unknown reason.

154
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,690
However, there is still so much
we do not know about it.

155
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,610
For example, at what stage
was it introduced to Clone Tup?

156
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,990
And why?

157
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:06,070
What is this thing?
Why would someone put it in Tup?

158
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,660
I believe this is an organic chip
built out of cells.

159
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,700
- What's it for?
- I do not know.

160
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,170
Ah, thanks. I need to find out
if what was in Tup's head is in mine.

161
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,720
We have already done a scan and...

162
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,260
But it was missed in Tup, and it
could have been missed in me, too!

163
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,180
You have to take it out.

164
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,030
We cannot be 100% sure
if the chip is even there.

165
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,440
I know it's there.

166
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,610
It is a dangerous surgery...

167
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,740
Look, you got it out of Tup,
you can get it out of me.

168
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,030
He died after I removed the chip.

169
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,910
Maybe it is connected.

170
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,370
You may die, too.

171
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,120
It's a chance I have to take.

172
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,710
I trust you.

173
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,550
All right, I will do it.

174
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,050
Let us go to a sterile facility.

175
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,740
Hold still. This will not hurt a bit.

176
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,870
Ahhh!

177
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,330
You sure you know
what you're doing, right?

178
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:37,000
Why, yes. I have been programmed
to perform over 100...

179
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,500
All right, all right.

180
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,830
Let's do this.

181
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,890
You will only be unconscious
for a few minutes.

182
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,040
There's no sign of them, General.

183
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,930
They must have escaped by now.

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,130
Escape was never their intention.

185
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,210
They are investigating, searching.

186
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,050
Their appearance
in the genetics labs proves this.

187
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:31,550
But what are they searching for?

188
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,900
Well? Was it...

189
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,650
- Was it there?
- Yes.

190
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,530
Identical in structure.

191
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,160
However, it appears that the one I found
in your friend had malfunctioned,

192
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,410
while yours is perfectly intact.

193
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,700
Are you sure
his breakdown was isolated?

194
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,120
There is no way of knowing that.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,170
And now that we have
removed your chip,

196
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,670
we do not know what will happen to you.

197
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,130
So, then,

198
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,340
I could snap, too?

199
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:16,350
Possibly. But when we removed
the chip from Tup, he...

200
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,310
I am afraid you may die as well.

201
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:22,600
I need to know if more clones
than just Tup and I have these,

202
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,650
and when we were implanted with them.

203
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,400
My analysis suggests
implantation took place

204
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,650
at the earliest stage of development,

205
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,780
most likely when you
and Tup were only embryos.

206
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,820
Then we have to start there.

207
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,510
Oh, great.

208
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,720
Try to act normal.

209
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,760
Normal?

210
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,520
Hello!

211
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:07,770
How was that? Was that normal?

212
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,570
For you, AZI, yeah.

213
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,890
We will start with the earliest stage
of development.

214
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,130
Nothing. I will now try a Stage 3 embryo.

215
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,040
- There it is!
- Ah! Try another.

216
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,130
Based on this data, I can calculate
how many in this tree are altered.

217
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,490
I can't believe it.

218
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,350
They all have one.

219
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,650
Don't move.

220
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,860
Why are you doing this?

221
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,160
I know what you've done!

222
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:40,990
What is it that you think I have done?

223
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,660
How do you explain this?

224
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,080
That is a structural inhibitor chip,

225
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:50,790
which is supposed to prevent you
from being aggressive,

226
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,210
like your source, Jango Fett.

227
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:58,760
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas instructed us to
implant them during your growth cycle.

228
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,260
The Jedi?

229
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,610
The Jedi had this done to us?

230
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,720
It is not uncommon to have
inhibitors placed in a clone.

231
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,770
I have analyzed this one,
and apparently it has failed.

232
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,990
Up until this point,
there has never been a problem.

233
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,440
Well, you have got a big problem now.

234
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,030
Don't move!

235
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,490
Drop your weapon.

236
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,540
Master Jedi, I know what's going on.

237
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,040
I have the evidence.

238
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,420
The Jedi instructed that inhibitor chips
be implanted in us at birth,

239
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,960
but Tup's malfunctioned.
That's what made him lose control.

240
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,210
Where is the evidence?

241
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,130
I have it right here.

242
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,430
As you can see, the chip taken from
Clone Trooper Tup is black and rotting,

243
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,430
indicating a malfunction of some sort.

244
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,020
What caused the malfunction?

245
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,480
It doesn't matter.
The fact is Tup's chip malfunctioned

246
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,940
and it drove him insane.

247
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
These chips have to be removed,

248
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:59,740
otherwise the entire Republic Army
could be compromised.

249
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,650
There's no proof of that!

250
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,610
This is an isolated incident.

251
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,490
Besides, when you removed
Trooper Tup's chip, he died.

252
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,120
Well, that's not going to happen
to the rest of us.

253
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,830
And how do you know that?

254
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Because I removed mine!

255
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Here is Clone Trooper Fives' chip.

256
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,760
As you can see, there is no sign of
malfunction in either him or the chip.

257
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,630
By removing your chip, you are a threat.

258
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,050
Master Jedi, we must terminate
this trooper immediately.

259
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,850
I am not a piece of hardware!
I'm a living being.

260
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,740
You were
created in our laboratories.

261
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,190
You are Kaminoan property!

262
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:40,690
Correction, technically,
he is property of the Republic.

263
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,700
That does not change the fact that
he is a danger and must be terminated.

264
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,450
I believe that's for me to decide.

265
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,370
Fives, you are coming
with me to Coruscant.

266
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,710
I think it's time you told
your story to the Chancellor.

267
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:58,290
Master Jedi! I beg you to reconsider!

268
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:02,420
The Chancellor wanted all the data
on Tup to be sent to Coruscant.

269
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,680
We're sending the data, the tumor
and Fives along with it.

270
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,720
Then I am going with you.

271
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:11,140
As you wish, Doctor.

272
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,860
Thank you for believing in me, General.

273
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,110
It is not a matter of belief, Fives,

274
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,740
it is simply the right thing to do.

275
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,210
It looks like
you got what you wanted.

276
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:36,750
Thanks to you.

277
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:39,500
I'll see you on the other side.

278
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,420
The other side of what?

279
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,930
Ah, droids.
