1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>A darkness awakes!</i>

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,290
<i>Count Dooku's bitter betrayal of
his former apprentice, Asajj Ventress,</i>

3
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,550
<i>resulted in the creation of a new menace
in the galaxy, Savage Opress.</i>

4
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,060
<i>Caught in a deadly game of revenge
between Ventress and Dooku,</i>

5
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:35,380
<i>Savage barely escaped the carnage.</i>

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:38,470
<i>Beaten and alone he returned
to Mother Talzin,</i>

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,060
<i>his creator, who gave him a new quest
to pursue his long-lost brother.</i>

8
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,690
I can sense him, Grievous.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,360
That creature, Savage Opress,
is growing stronger and stronger

10
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,660
as each day passes.

11
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:03,170
You consider him a threat?

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,950
He is a threat to all of us!

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,580
Even the Jedi!

14
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,880
With the Nightsisters eradicated,
there is no one left to control him.

15
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,130
Something is rising, something sinister.

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,940
He's choking her.

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,440
- Hey!
- Let her go!

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,740
He's choking her.

19
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,700
Hurry up! Call the authorities!

20
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,380
Mother Talzin, this dust,

21
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,050
it's a clue.

22
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,900
Yes, Savage, you are getting
closer and closer.

23
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,250
Soon you and your brother will be reunited.

24
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:22,200
I must make the necessary preparations.

25
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,490
So he hands me a blaster
about a fourth the size...

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,740
Cheers.

27
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,620
- Why so tense?
- I'm not sure.

28
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,250
I thought I sensed someone from my past.

29
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,090
Who is this someone?

30
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,090
A monster.

31
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Huh. Hey! What are you doing here?
Get outta here! I'm about to take off!

32
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,510
The cargo you just dropped off,
what planet did it come from?

33
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,060
The junk fields on planet Lotho Minor!

34
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,470
- Take me there.
- Okay! Okay!

35
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,480
Uh, shouldn't we be getting
back to the cruiser?

36
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,030
Nah, I'm hungry and tired of
those government rations.

37
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,990
Hey, looks like trouble. Come on.

38
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,460
Hey, what are you doing?

39
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,210
We don't want any trouble.
We were only trying to help.

40
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,670
Lou! Are you crazy?
Pointing that thing at a Jedi?

41
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,630
Put it down now!

42
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,930
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just all shook up.

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,260
I understand. You want to tell me
what happened here?

44
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,140
We have it under control, sir.

45
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,020
It looks like only a simple altercation.
Happens here all the time.

46
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,730
He's telling the truth.
We get some rough characters in here.

47
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,530
Things like this happen too often to count.

48
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,200
Why don't you and your friend
take a load off?

49
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,280
I'll get you some food.
Meal's on the house.

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,420
You're not gonna kill me, are you?

51
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,680
Master?

52
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,890
Anakin?

53
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:01,740
I sense a disturbance. Something sinister.

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,650
All the way out here?

55
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,450
Yes.

56
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,570
Do you know what, or who, it is?

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,660
No,
but whatever it is, it feels familiar.

58
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,550
Just my luck, I got to go back
to that scrap pile floating in space.

59
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,340
Just get moving.

60
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:29,640
Fine, I guess things could be worse.

61
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Though I'm not sure how.

62
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,620
He is close.

63
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,610
- Get out. Now!
- No. Come on!

64
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,580
I'm here at last, brother.

65
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,890
No, no, not when I'm so close!

66
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,700
Hey! Big guy!

67
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,450
I don't have time for you!

68
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,840
Over here!

69
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,920
You trackin' somebody?

70
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:09,040
What do you know about it?

71
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,630
I'm... I'm Morley.

72
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,640
I could help you!

73
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,550
We've got everything here!

74
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,440
I can get you what you want,
for the right amount, of course.

75
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:31,110
I mean, it'd be my payment-free
pleasure, of course!

76
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,690
I think I can manage on my own.

77
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,120
Show me something,
show me which way to go!

78
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,960
What you need is a guide!

79
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:49,330
Leave me alone!

80
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,130
Wait!

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Trust me! Not everything
on this planet is junk.

82
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:58,680
It's not?

83
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,300
There are things like me.

84
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,850
Things that live and breathe.

85
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:08,270
Perhaps you're looking for something
more like that.

86
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,600
Show me.

87
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,520
You're already heading
in the right direction,

88
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:16,280
even though your
Handy doo-da there isn't working.

89
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,370
But you'll need my guidance to
avoid the fire-breathers.

90
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,000
Fire-breathers?

91
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,850
Yep. Fire-breathers.
They'll getcha! Follow me!

92
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,260
Ah!

93
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,010
The Junkers. Junkers strange folk.

94
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,060
Yeah, looks like it.

95
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,560
We better get outta here.

96
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,350
They can get a little cranky.

97
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,580
Big guy, we really should go.

98
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,580
A fight?

99
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
Wow!

100
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,470
Let's go.

101
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,100
So, who are you looking for?

102
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,140
Come on.

103
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,100
My brother. I've been searching for him.

104
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,150
Uh... Does he look like you?

105
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,280
Have you seen him?

106
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,450
No. No. I just heard stories
about a horned man.

107
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,500
I thought it was just an old local legend.

108
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,330
How old?

109
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,330
Old.

110
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,680
They say he drags things down beneath

111
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,800
and they never come back up.

112
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,510
Oh, but it's only a legend, like I said.

113
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,810
Acid rain.

114
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,030
It'll melt us down
if we don't find shelter soon.

115
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,360
Over there.

116
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,040
Oh, oh, oh...

117
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,500
What the...

118
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,680
This is it.

119
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,070
It doesn't look like anyone's here,
big guy.

120
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,660
I can see that!

121
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,250
Mother Talzin! She betrayed me!

122
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,340
My brother must be dead!

123
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:57,600
She's not the only one who betrayed you!

124
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,230
You'll make a good offering

125
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,570
and when my master's finished with you,
I get the leftovers!

126
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,250
Brother? Is that you, brother?

127
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,190
Is that you, brother?

128
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
You!

129
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,140
Stop there! What have you done
with my brother?

130
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,050
Answer me, you monster!

131
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,450
What? It can't be.

132
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,170
- Brother!
- No!

133
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,260
Wait, brother!

134
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,430
No! No!

135
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,860
No! No! No!

136
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,450
You are the brother
I've been searching for.

137
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,370
No! No! No! No! No!

138
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,950
Yes! We are, we are brothers.

139
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,290
No!

140
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,340
You... You don't know!

141
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,210
You don't know anything!

142
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:16,300
Never, never!

143
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:18,970
I know I am your blood!

144
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,180
Never!

145
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,470
Never, never!

146
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,820
I'm ready for my leftovers.

147
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,200
Oh! You're still alive, huh?

148
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,080
- Who did this to my brother?
- No.

149
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,830
Are you part of this?

150
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,580
No.

151
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,370
No. No. I found him this way.

152
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:52,930
It wasn't me. I found him this way.

153
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,260
You can't be trusted.
You're a slithering liar!

154
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,880
You should have been helping him!

155
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:02,180
I didn't know! I didn't know!

156
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,400
This is where you live?

157
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,360
How long have you been here?

158
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,030
Years and years and years.

159
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,030
Through victory, my chains are broken.
The chains, the chains are the easy part.

160
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,330
It's what goes on in here that's hard.

161
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,460
You have been lost, my brother.

162
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,710
Do you remember who you are?

163
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,710
Where you came from?

164
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,090
Always remember I am fear,
always remember I am hunter,

165
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,470
always remember I am filth,
always remember I am nothing.

166
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,400
Your legs...

167
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,900
That scum, he took them from me.
He took them!

168
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,900
Who? Who took them?

169
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,820
Jedi. Jedi.

170
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,740
- You remember?
- I don't ask for mercy, Master.

171
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,830
Mercy is a lie, a delusion of the weak
to think themselves strong.

172
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,750
- I ask not for mercy...
- What? What is it?

173
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,930
- But the chance...
- Brother, what are you saying?

174
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,420
And through the filth,
through the grief, Jedi!

175
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,300
Revenge.

176
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,760
I must have revenge.

177
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,980
Master Yoda?

178
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,990
Feel the disturbance in the Force, do you?

179
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,820
Yes, Master.

180
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,160
Fear you are in danger, I do.

181
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,290
From the dead, an old enemy
has awakened seeking vengeance.

182
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,600
An old enemy?

183
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:01,460
Killed your master many moons ago,
he did.

184
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,930
How can this be? I killed him myself!

185
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,300
It is so, I fear.

186
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,640
Darth Maul alive?
