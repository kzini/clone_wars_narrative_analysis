1
00:00:16,579 --> 00:00:18,294
<i>War on many fronts!</i>

2
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:20,946
<i>While battles are fought
by Clones in the field.</i>

3
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:23,562
<i>A different war is waged
on the Galactic Senate.</i>

4
00:00:23,826 --> 00:00:25,178
<i>As heavy loses add up</i>

5
00:00:25,298 --> 00:00:27,628
<i>a group of senators lead
by Halle Burtoni of Comino</i>

6
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:30,392
<i>propose an escalation
of troop production</i>

7
00:00:30,752 --> 00:00:35,242
<i>Senator Padme Amidala, recognizing that
more troops will only prolong the fighting.</i>

8
00:00:35,362 --> 00:00:39,281
<i>Works tirelessly with her allies to
introduce a bill to cut military spending</i>

9
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,466
<i>and stop the creation
of more clone troopers.</i>

10
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:49,725
Yes of course Senator. Thank
you for telling me yourself.

11
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,379
I completely understand.

12
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,294
Did we loose someone else's vote?

13
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:57,830
Senator Stank is worried
about Republic opinion.

14
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:01,032
But he wants us to know
how very sorry he is.

15
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,829
Sorry doesn't get us votes.

16
00:01:03,153 --> 00:01:05,771
We will get votes, when in your speech,

17
00:01:06,035 --> 00:01:09,574
you convince people to stand
up for what they know is right.

18
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,713
I hope you're right, Uncle.

19
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:14,695
You have been doing an amazing
job, rallying votes to our side.

20
00:01:14,815 --> 00:01:16,614
Choose cool Senator Farr.

21
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:26,117
Perhaps, I am the most
influential man on Rodia, Lolo.

22
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,278
But after all the mistakes I've made,

23
00:01:29,994 --> 00:01:30,832
peace...

24
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:33,479
is what matters to me now.

25
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,747
Senator Amidala,

26
00:01:34,867 --> 00:01:37,307
they're ready for your
speech now. It's time.

27
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:42,254
We'll see you in the
chamber, Senator Amidala.

28
00:01:42,374 --> 00:01:43,607
Good luck, Padme.

29
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:49,663
It is quite exciting.

30
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:52,272
Exciting isn't exactly
the word I would use.

31
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,717
I think terrifying is more appropriate.

32
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,079
Pay her no mind Senator Organa...

33
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,829
Even as a girl, Padme
down played her strengths

34
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:04,245
helps to maintain the
element of surprise.

35
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,299
I learned it from you.
See you inside Senators.

36
00:02:13,206 --> 00:02:16,178
<i>The creation of more
warriors will not end this war</i>

37
00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:20,129
<i>the financial cost alone will
bankrupt and cripple the Republic.</i>

38
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:22,261
<i>By adding more clones to the conflict,</i>

39
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:26,190
<i>we're only escalating the
destruction, not winning the war.</i>

40
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,330
<i>Which is why we must vote for this
resolution to promote more diplomacy,</i>

41
00:02:31,529 --> 00:02:34,994
<i>and to bring an end to
this killing, and hatred.</i>

42
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:07,058
Oh, it wasn't a compliment.

43
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,464
You shouldn't make speeches like that.

44
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,351
It's unpatriotic.

45
00:03:13,585 --> 00:03:17,140
The only thing I find
unpatriotic is your war mongering.

46
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:30,871
Truly,

47
00:03:30,991 --> 00:03:32,622
you have turned the tide.

48
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,304
My dear, you were brilliant.

49
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:39,094
Thank you. But perhaps,

50
00:03:39,214 --> 00:03:42,744
we should wait to we actually win the
vote before we make a victory speech.

51
00:03:42,864 --> 00:03:44,681
What a novel idea.

52
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:47,984
Imagine that.

53
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:52,392
Amadala's actually making
sense for once in her life.

54
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,479
Senator Burtoni. This is
a private conversation.

55
00:03:56,936 --> 00:04:00,694
Private conversation or
separatist conspiracy?

56
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:04,281
How dare you? We're not pro separatist.

57
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:05,736
We want to end the war.

58
00:04:05,737 --> 00:04:08,991
- Committing more troops to the front
lines will not allow diplomacy to resume.

59
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:13,119
Diplomacy failed the Republic long ago.

60
00:04:13,352 --> 00:04:14,841
Senators, please.

61
00:04:15,364 --> 00:04:16,726
Senator Burtoni,

62
00:04:17,066 --> 00:04:19,496
the Kaminoans might have
bartered their creation

63
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:22,295
of the clones into a seat
in the Galactic Senate.

64
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,196
But this is not give you free reign.

65
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:28,307
Thank you for visiting, Senator.

66
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:32,541
We would like to continue our
meeting now... if you don't mind.

67
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,732
Enjoy your moment in
the spot light Senators.

68
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,666
This war will not end soon.

69
00:04:45,657 --> 00:04:48,937
Well, we must be doing something
right if we've rattled Senator Burtoni.

70
00:04:49,057 --> 00:04:52,858
What matters is that we've made great
strides in our fight against this bill.

71
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:55,896
I know you've done a wonderful
job leading the effort

72
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,179
I'm just trying to do what's right.

73
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,081
I only wish I'd tried
doing that a long time ago.

74
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,453
You're doing it now.

75
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:07,218
To victory and an end to this war.

76
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,729
To victories.

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,310
My heart,

78
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,724
I can't breathe.

79
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:17,544
Uncle? What is it?

80
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:21,111
Ono! It's his heart!

81
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:23,048
Please! Someone get help!

82
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,079
And we are all aware that
Ono Condo was a flawed man.

83
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,767
He knew better than
anyone of his own mistakes.

84
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,820
But he never compromised his principals.

85
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:42,118
And what he did, he did for his people.

86
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:45,045
Their needs always came first.

87
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,203
Senator, if you need anything.

88
00:06:00,563 --> 00:06:03,295
What we need is to get
his resolution passed.

89
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:24,789
He was my mentor.

90
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:28,257
I don't know how to carry
on without him guiding me.

91
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:31,465
I know. No one could
ever take his place.

92
00:06:31,585 --> 00:06:34,988
Excuse me. Chancellor Palpatine has
summoned both of you to his chambers.

93
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:45,990
What's happened?

94
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,795
I'm afraid my friends that Lieutenant
Divo here has some questions

95
00:06:50,395 --> 00:06:51,881
about Senator Farr.

96
00:06:52,834 --> 00:06:55,793
Do you know of anyone who...

97
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:59,173
how to put this...

98
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,743
hated Senator Farr?

99
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:03,416
Enough to kill him?

100
00:07:03,952 --> 00:07:04,720
What?

101
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,041
I'll need to find out who
wanted to hurt Senator Farr...

102
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,786
Actually kill him
would be more accurate.

103
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,566
What with him being dead.

104
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:19,454
No one wanted him dead

105
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,403
Everyone loved him

106
00:07:21,597 --> 00:07:22,672
Well, that's obviously

107
00:07:23,153 --> 00:07:26,316
not true or I wouldn't
be here, and he would.

108
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:30,292
Lieutenant, even Ono's
political enemies respected him

109
00:07:31,105 --> 00:07:32,756
we need time to deal with this situation

110
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:38,712
Time, time, there's no time. A murderers
on the lose and it's my job to find him.

111
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:41,334
Ahem

112
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,452
what makes you think it was murder

113
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:45,174
poison of course

114
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,761
the politician's preferred method

115
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,362
found a chemical in his blood
stream, killed him right away.

116
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:52,164
It's an obvious case.

117
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:54,124
Politicians always
have something to hide.

118
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,529
And it always come back to haunt them.

119
00:07:57,794 --> 00:07:58,984
Am I right?

120
00:08:00,877 --> 00:08:03,938
Oh! Look who I am asking
a room full of politicians

121
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:10,544
So, one of Farr's secrets
must have resurfaced.

122
00:08:10,545 --> 00:08:12,119
Ono had no secrets.

123
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:13,514
That's not it.

124
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:14,924
Perhaps someone was upset

125
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,654
about the Clone troop bill
currently on the floor.

126
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,625
It's very controversial

127
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,948
Thank you Senator Amadala, is it?

128
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:25,422
But I have my theory

129
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:27,538
and I'll follow my
hunch if you don't mind.

130
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,890
After all I am the
inspector. your the senator.

131
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,573
So I'll handle the inspecting

132
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:34,737
and you can stick to the 'senating'.

133
00:08:38,377 --> 00:08:39,223
Good day.

134
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:42,818
Murder.

135
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:46,106
It's inconceivable.

136
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:51,160
Who would wish Ono Conda
harm? What if it's the BIM.

137
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:53,083
What if we're all being targeted.

138
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,889
Speculation gets us no where.

139
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,400
There is work to do, we should
double our efforts on the vote

140
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:00,264
It'll be even harder with Ono gone.

141
00:09:00,265 --> 00:09:03,921
No, no, we should delay the vote.

142
00:09:04,162 --> 00:09:09,080
But why? No one will give the vote their full
attention they know what's happened to Ono.

143
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,699
Well, maybe I can put
a motion on the floor

144
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,837
I don't think anyone will
object given the circumstances.

145
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:17,064
Good

146
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,648
and we'll have time to
conduct our own investigation

147
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:22,869
Detective Divo specifically asked us

148
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,021
not to interfere.

149
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,172
- Well he didn't exactly
inspire confidence did he?

150
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:29,423
He didn't know Ono.

151
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:30,822
We did.

152
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:33,167
We'll have a far easier
time looking into this

153
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:35,674
than detective Divo will.

154
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,187
Running around could
disrupt our coalition

155
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,706
Yet you still seem determined
to see this through.

156
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:43,221
Indeed I am.

157
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:46,391
and I don't supposed
you'd considering bringing

158
00:09:46,392 --> 00:09:48,098
Captain Tyfo along with you? No.

159
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:50,239
I'd rather do this quietly

160
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,984
then perhaps Sentator Organa,
you should accompany her.

161
00:09:54,225 --> 00:09:56,541
I think that's an excellent idea.

162
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,027
I don't need a guardian.

163
00:09:58,027 --> 00:10:00,009
Of course not my dear

164
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,777
think of it as precautionary.

165
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,791
Don't worry, I won't get in your way.

166
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:05,801
- very well, I don't
have any objections.

167
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:08,230
And I know exactly where to start.

168
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:23,186
You're suggesting one of
us killed Ono Conda Farr.

169
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:26,075
How delightful. I don't
find any of this amusing.

170
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:27,036
Neither do I.

171
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:35,229
Every time Ono opened his befuddled mouth it
gave us another quote to use in our fund-raising.

172
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,295
Why would we kill our
best source of income.

173
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:41,358
You both opposed Ono's
ideas in the senate.

174
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:43,005
With enough at stake

175
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,400
maybe you decided to silence his voice

176
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:49,309
for good. Ono Conda
and I were often at odds

177
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,668
but I respected him.

178
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:54,699
- I respected him greatly.
- For the record,

179
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,933
I had no respect for
Ono Conda what so ever.

180
00:10:58,934 --> 00:11:04,646
Ono had a secret meeting at the docks on
the direct Major on the night before he died.

181
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:08,085
And you just happened to
know about this meeting how?

182
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,941
Oh, I was having Ono followed.

183
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:13,803
Just because I respected Ono,

184
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:18,546
doesn't mean I wasn't trying
to get dirt on him. Of course.

185
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:21,628
The point is... a clandestined off the

186
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:24,226
books meeting under cover of darkness.

187
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:28,208
Perhaps that location holds some clue.

188
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,960
Fine, I will go look.
But whatever we find,

189
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:34,242
I'll have more questions
for both of you.

190
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:50,460
Have I said that I think we're
very far out of our element here?

191
00:11:50,461 --> 00:11:54,173
Yes, Bail. I believed that
you've mentioned once or twice.

192
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:13,611
Using this investigation to bury your
grief, might not be the best way to...

193
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,737
I'm not.

194
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:19,583
Then why can't you just
leave it to Lieutenant Divo?

195
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:33,945
Padme!

196
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:13,913
Wait! Watch out!

197
00:14:00,831 --> 00:14:04,946
Senator Amadala is it possible
you might be going deaf?

198
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:05,108
Lieutenant?

199
00:14:05,109 --> 00:14:08,754
Because when I said I didn't want you
to interfere with my investigation.

200
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:12,535
I can only assume you didn't hear me.

201
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:14,855
I had some information about
a lead here at the docks.

202
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:19,972
Which you naturally brought to me straight
away so I could investigate... only...

203
00:14:19,973 --> 00:14:23,213
no wait.. you did exactly
the opposite of that.

204
00:14:23,454 --> 00:14:25,502
There are rules senator

205
00:14:25,503 --> 00:14:27,197
my friend was murdered.

206
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:29,187
I don't care about rules.

207
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:32,442
Don't care about rules?

208
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,482
My dears without rules

209
00:14:34,483 --> 00:14:36,841
there's only chaos. everyone
must care about rules.

210
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:38,730
We know that.

211
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:41,393
But now you've alerted the
killer that you're on to him.

212
00:14:41,394 --> 00:14:43,752
And my investigation
is that much harder.

213
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,106
Do you have any idea how many
reports I'll have to file now.

214
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:48,624
We alerted the killer.

215
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,232
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

216
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:53,177
What if we were sent here on purpose.

217
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:54,314
To the docks?

218
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:55,182
Yes!

219
00:14:55,183 --> 00:14:57,056
What if this was all a setup.

220
00:14:57,537 --> 00:15:00,984
What if Dechee sent us here
just so he could kill us.

221
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,724
If we hurry we might still be able to

222
00:15:02,725 --> 00:15:03,963
catch Dechee before
he leaves the senate.

223
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:04,718
Agreed!

224
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:07,762
But wait, I'm still investigating.

225
00:15:07,763 --> 00:15:09,855
This is still an active crime

226
00:15:09,856 --> 00:15:11,840
scene you can't... oh fine.

227
00:15:16,926 --> 00:15:19,328
Senator Dechee, I'm
sure you're surprised

228
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:22,463
to see me, after what
you. Oh! he's dead.

229
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:24,295
He's been stabbed.

230
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:27,876
This is definitely going
to require another report.

231
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:36,481
The killer is obviously
targeting the leadership.

232
00:15:36,482 --> 00:15:38,919
You must stay here under my protection.

233
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,692
Why? So the killer can
take us all out at once?

234
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,733
Oh, that's preposterous.

235
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,772
Even if the killer did
get through my security,

236
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:48,735
it's very unlikely that all
of you would end up dead.

237
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:50,967
We are far to easy a
target sitting here.

238
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,456
I am leaving.

239
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:55,091
No you can't leave Lolo. I think...

240
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,839
in this instance, the
Inspector is right.

241
00:15:59,282 --> 00:16:00,204
Out of my way

242
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:06,520
Oh, who else knew you
were going to the docks.

243
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,258
Just Senator Bertoni. She was the
only other one in the room with us.

244
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:12,690
Bertoni, eh?

245
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:22,464
Sir, Senator Bertoni is not here.

246
00:16:23,185 --> 00:16:24,500
Ah!

247
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,732
Looks like that long necked Kaminonan

248
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,917
has flown the coop.

249
00:16:31,868 --> 00:16:33,513
It's been a difficult time.

250
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,347
You've handled yourself well.

251
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,556
I had to try.

252
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,232
Ono believed if you see injustice

253
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:41,385
you can't wait for
someone else to fix it.

254
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,168
You must stand up and get involved.

255
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,161
He did.

256
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,747
Help, I have been attacked.

257
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,768
She's over there.

258
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:52,521
She tried to kill me.

259
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:53,695
What happened?

260
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:55,192
Senator Bertoni.

261
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,365
She jumped me.

262
00:16:56,366 --> 00:16:59,079
She's in the east wing corridor. Hurry!

263
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,123
Guards go.

264
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,384
You're insane.

265
00:17:07,865 --> 00:17:10,257
I didn't kill anyone.

266
00:17:10,258 --> 00:17:14,027
Last thing I remember I
was walking to my office.

267
00:17:14,268 --> 00:17:16,325
Then I woke up here.

268
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,105
Senator Lolo has a very different story.

269
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,777
She says you attacked her.

270
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:22,193
Attacked her?

271
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:23,319
Lolo?

272
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:28,270
If I ever attack someone

273
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:31,972
I hope it will be
someone mildly important.

274
00:17:32,453 --> 00:17:34,935
Someone like Senator Farr?

275
00:17:35,176 --> 00:17:37,432
Ono was a harmless bug.

276
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,713
I wouldn't bother killing him.

277
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:41,640
And Dechee was my ally.

278
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,272
I've been thinking about how you

279
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:46,422
were in Senator Amadala's office

280
00:17:46,423 --> 00:17:48,012
right before Farr died.

281
00:17:48,253 --> 00:17:50,174
So what?

282
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:53,117
And I've been thinking about
how you were in Dechee's

283
00:17:53,118 --> 00:17:55,380
office to hear about
the meeting at the docks.

284
00:17:55,381 --> 00:17:58,276
A meeting I think Farr has with you.

285
00:17:58,469 --> 00:18:01,763
It wasn't me. You have no proof.

286
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,014
No? I have this.

287
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:08,519
I ordered an extensive forensic

288
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,363
report on Farr as soon as he died.

289
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:14,533
The poison which killed Farr
only affected Rodian blood.

290
00:18:14,774 --> 00:18:17,683
And it was developed
by Kamonian scientists.

291
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:20,108
But.. that's...

292
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,203
I didn't kill him.

293
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:24,687
You're Kamanoain. You
had access to the poison.

294
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:27,384
That's motive, means,
and opportunity. Guards!

295
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:32,894
But the scan must be wrong.

296
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:34,730
If the poison was in all our drinks.

297
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,620
Lolo would have died too.

298
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:37,511
What?

299
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:40,306
She's Rodian. She'd
have been poisoned too.

300
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:42,934
Unless she didn't drink.

301
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,855
But you drank, right Lolo?

302
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,263
Lolo,

303
00:18:48,914 --> 00:18:50,125
you didn't drink.

304
00:18:50,366 --> 00:18:51,502
Did you?

305
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,544
You're right, I should
have pretended to drink.

306
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:58,345
Alright, You're coming
with me, for insurance.

307
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:02,534
Why did you kill Ono?

308
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:04,877
He brought war to my planet.

309
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,696
No! He made a mistake, Lolo.

310
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:11,867
Which everyone seemed to
forget, including you. I didn't.

311
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:15,696
Did you honestly think he had
the moral right to lead us?

312
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,223
After he betrayed us?

313
00:19:17,464 --> 00:19:19,013
He was sorry!

314
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:20,615
He was weak!

315
00:19:21,477 --> 00:19:24,220
We needed someone of strength
to stand against this war.

316
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:25,982
I tried to scare him at the docks.

317
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:27,998
But he wouldn't go
away, so I removed him.

318
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,335
And then I heard Dechee
heard about the meeting.

319
00:19:31,816 --> 00:19:33,051
He had to go too.

320
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,007
Halt! Put down your weapon.

321
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:55,631
With the final votes tallied.

322
00:19:56,303 --> 00:19:58,167
Let it be known that
the motion to stop the

323
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:01,123
the creation of more
clone troops has failed.

324
00:20:01,982 --> 00:20:04,693
And the continued
manufacturing of clone troopers

325
00:20:04,934 --> 00:20:07,393
shall proceed as scheduled

326
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,784
After all that.

327
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:19,360
We lost.

328
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:22,459
I know this decision
was most unexpected.

329
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,626
I myself don't support it, but,

330
00:20:25,627 --> 00:20:27,697
democracy must stand.

331
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,717
Of course, you were right chancellor.

332
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:35,115
Actually, given recent events
perhaps it is for the best.

333
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,696
How can we justify

334
00:20:36,697 --> 00:20:39,319
fortifying our security
here in the senate.

335
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,618
If we don't provide
reenforcement on the front lines.

336
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:45,260
You see,

337
00:20:45,501 --> 00:20:48,339
the victory of the clone army, for now,

338
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,629
is the only thing that
can lead us to peace.
