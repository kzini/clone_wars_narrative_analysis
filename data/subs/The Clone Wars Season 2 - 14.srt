1
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,763
A diplomatic mission.

2
00:00:18,843 --> 00:00:22,763
As dissent threatens to tear apart
the peaceful Mandalore system,

3
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:27,603
Duchess Satine struggles to protect
her people against the escalating violence.

4
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:32,724
Betrayed by two of her trusted allies,
Satine now travels to Coruscant.

5
00:00:32,804 --> 00:00:34,524
There, she hopes to convince the Senate

6
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:37,124
that a destructive splinter group,
Death Watch,

7
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:40,604
does not represent
the entire Mandalorian government.

8
00:00:48,725 --> 00:00:51,605
With your Death Watch army in place,

9
00:00:51,686 --> 00:00:56,206
now all we need do is to sit and wait.

10
00:00:56,286 --> 00:00:59,445
But for how long?
My men are anxious to fight.

11
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,486
Considering the plot
we've just set in motion,

12
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:06,886
I assure you the Republic will oblige you
the fight you're looking for.

13
00:01:06,967 --> 00:01:10,607
First, send a Death Watch assassin
to Coruscant.

14
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,447
The Duchess of Mandalore must die.

15
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,051
Prime Minister.

16
00:02:02,131 --> 00:02:07,171
- You found the Death Watch armies, then?
- Yes, sir. They are preparing for battle.

17
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,291
But if they attack,

18
00:02:08,412 --> 00:02:12,212
it would strengthen the people's resolve
not to join the Death Watch movement.

19
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,851
The Death Watch will never be
strong enough to take over Mandalore

20
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,452
without the will of the people.

21
00:02:16,573 --> 00:02:19,412
Not if the Republic
has a military presence here.

22
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:23,092
Their occupation will turn the Death Watch
from terrorists to liberators

23
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:24,732
in the eyes of the people.

24
00:02:24,773 --> 00:02:28,213
But how can we stop the Republic
from coming here?

25
00:02:28,293 --> 00:02:32,373
Our fate now lies in the hands
of Duchess Satine.

26
00:02:37,054 --> 00:02:43,093
It grieves me to say it, but Death Watch
is now a significant, deadly threat.

27
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:47,735
Mandalore is making great strides to find
the leaders of this terrorist movement.

28
00:02:47,815 --> 00:02:50,855
They are not powerful enough
to destabilize our government.

29
00:02:50,935 --> 00:02:53,215
We will resolve this without conflict.

30
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:58,495
If the Republic gets involved in our affairs
it will only lead to further violence.

31
00:02:58,536 --> 00:03:01,535
Thus I shall reassert our position
of neutrality.

32
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:05,855
- Talk of an idealist.
- No, those are the words of a pacifist

33
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,256
and a people
who have chosen non-violent action.

34
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:11,016
That may be so, Duchess.

35
00:03:11,097 --> 00:03:15,176
However, this message was delivered
to my staff just this morning.

36
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,296
I think you shall find it most illuminating.

37
00:03:20,858 --> 00:03:25,737
The actions by our government
have taken us into a period of civil war.

38
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:28,377
To acknowledge it
would be to invite panic in the streets.

39
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,938
- Duchess, do you know this man?
- And so we hid the truth from our people.

40
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:34,618
Yes. Deputy Minister Jerec.
He's a dear friend.

41
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:38,538
It is more than mere possibility,
more than eventuality.

44
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,458
He would never commit such lies
to the record.

45
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,219
The Mandalorian government
holds no secrets from its people.

46
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,219
If only that were true.

47
00:03:53,421 --> 00:03:56,700
Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.

48
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,580
If we are to combat them effectively,
we must have Republic assistance.

49
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,020
Instead, this government acts out of pride
and rejects the help of the Jedi.

50
00:04:06,061 --> 00:04:07,580
It's not true. It's not true!

51
00:04:07,662 --> 00:04:10,981
The Duchess Satine
will ultimately cause our defeat.

52
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:16,061
Make no mistake, Republic intervention
is absolutely necessary.

53
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:22,381
This isn't right. Something here isn't right!
I wish to speak to Jerec immediately.

54
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:26,542
Sadly, Deputy Minister Jerec
perished this morning

55
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:29,702
in a Death Watch bombing on Kalevala.

56
00:04:29,743 --> 00:04:33,262
Let us ensure
that his death was not in vain.

57
00:04:33,344 --> 00:04:37,103
Let us commit our military might
to defending the Mandalorian people.

58
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:40,303
Defending? You mean to occupy our home.

59
00:04:40,424 --> 00:04:43,983
You would trample our right
to self-determination.

60
00:04:44,064 --> 00:04:45,983
We mean to save your people.

61
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:48,463
You will turn our planet
into a military target

62
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,464
which will bring the war to us.

63
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:53,224
Mandalore must remain a neutral system.

64
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:56,904
The vote shall commence
in the next session.

65
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,305
Duchess!

66
00:05:01,105 --> 00:05:02,704
Satine, wait.

67
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:08,385
I just heard what happened in the Senate.

68
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:13,545
You're sweet to be concerned.
But I promise I'll be all right.

69
00:05:13,586 --> 00:05:16,425
I am concerned. We're friends, are we not?

70
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:20,306
Yes, friends and nothing more.

71
00:05:20,347 --> 00:05:22,186
Satine, as your friend,

72
00:05:22,227 --> 00:05:25,587
I don't think you should make
any decisions in this state of mind.

73
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:29,907
This state of mind? And what
state of mind would that be, precisely?

74
00:05:30,547 --> 00:05:32,307
What I'm saying is...

75
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,387
Any person would be hysterical
by now, but...

76
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:37,947
Hysterical?
The Republic is attempting to force its will

77
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:40,468
- upon innocent people.
- I only meant...

78
00:05:40,588 --> 00:05:43,027
Frankly, I'm surprised
you're not hysterical.

79
00:05:43,549 --> 00:05:47,348
Perhaps if more citizens got hysterical,
they'd be more inclined to speak up

80
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:49,869
when the Republic tramples
on their rights.

81
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:51,548
Rushing in like this, it's...

82
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,588
It's foolhardy.

83
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:57,589
Ironic words from a man who spends
his days running hither and yon,

84
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,629
wielding his lightsaber with deadly force
as if on a crusade.

85
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:05,549
Why should I listen to someone
who so frequently relies on violence?

86
00:06:05,591 --> 00:06:08,630
In my opinion,
you're the one who's foolhardy.

87
00:06:34,513 --> 00:06:36,832
- What's happening?
- It's the navigation system.

88
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:41,112
Get her out of here.

89
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:48,473
There's a platform ahead.
I'll try to get closer.

90
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:50,913
No, stop! Aramis!

91
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:53,433
Jump!

92
00:07:07,876 --> 00:07:11,354
What do you mean,
no charges are to be filed? None at all?

93
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:13,155
Someone tried to kill me.

94
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:15,996
The controls on my speeder
were compromised.

95
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:20,195
Sadly, my dear, there is no proof
anyone tampered with anything.

96
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:23,116
I'm afraid it might have been
just an accident.

97
00:07:23,197 --> 00:07:24,276
An accident?

98
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,716
And it just happened to coincide
with me defending my home world?

99
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:31,036
- I agree with Satine.
- Well! Finally.

100
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,237
It proves what I've been saying all along.

101
00:07:33,317 --> 00:07:37,597
Death Watch is out of control.
The Republic must step in and help.

102
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:38,717
No. Wait, I didn't...

103
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:43,077
You can't keep them reined in, obviously,
so we will.

104
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,037
This is patently offensive.
You can't do this.

105
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:49,918
Unfortunately, it is up to the Senate now.

106
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,598
I'm sure they'll make
a reasoned and thoughtful decision.

107
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,559
Satine, I just heard about your accident.

108
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,999
Those two are...

109
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,519
This government will...

110
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,439
Satine, tell me what happened!

111
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:12,040
I'm fine. I wasn't hurt.

112
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:13,919
I didn't want to worry you.

113
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:17,520
Well, I'm afraid on that count
you failed spectacularly.

114
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:21,080
- Look what happened.
- Look what happened?

115
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:25,601
This attack proves I've upset someone.
I must be on the right track.

116
00:08:25,682 --> 00:08:29,361
This attack proves your enemies are here
even on Coruscant.

117
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:33,521
You're not going to let Republic authorities
handle this, are you?

118
00:08:33,602 --> 00:08:37,842
- You're not backing down.
- Republic authorities? Certainly not.

119
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:40,282
I'm on my way
to the Ministry of Intelligence right now

120
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:42,122
to meet my contact.

121
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:43,962
Don't you see?

122
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:47,522
You need your friends with you,
not held at arm's length.

123
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,162
In your quest to be self-reliant,

124
00:08:49,244 --> 00:08:52,722
have you decided
to cut your friends out of your life?

125
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:55,043
I don't know.

126
00:08:56,124 --> 00:08:58,163
Senator, what is it?

127
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:02,043
The Senate completed its vote.
They've decided in favor of occupation.

128
00:09:02,764 --> 00:09:06,364
When did this happen?
The vote was supposed to be tomorrow.

129
00:09:06,444 --> 00:09:08,524
It was during your meeting
with the Chancellor.

130
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,205
Your accident
accelerated the Senate's decision.

131
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,964
Republic forces are set to leave
for Mandalore at sunrise tomorrow.

132
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:17,205
You see? I was right before.

133
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:21,805
Counting on the Republic is a mistake.

134
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,767
I don't have much time.
They're following me.

135
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:02,208
You've put yourself in great danger.
I'll never forget it.

136
00:10:02,289 --> 00:10:04,608
I had to come. This is worth it.

137
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,488
Where did you get this?

138
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,489
Buried deep in the evidence facility
at the Ministry.

139
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,409
It was not easy to find, believe me.

140
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,090
You were right.
Someone faked the evidence.

141
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,570
The recording presented to the Senate
was not the full recording.

142
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:27,850
But this disk is.
You must show the Senate...

143
00:10:31,611 --> 00:10:32,730
Davu!

144
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,611
No.

145
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:44,012
We have a shooting
in Sector GL-5.

146
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:46,812
Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.

147
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:52,492
Hands where we can see them.
You are coming with us.

148
00:10:52,574 --> 00:10:54,333
I didn't kill him.

149
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:58,652
Subject identified
as Duchess Satine Kryze.

150
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,177
We spotted her.
She's heading into the alley.

151
00:11:55,178 --> 00:11:59,058
Cancel that. She's escaping in a speeder,
heading for section I-G-44.

152
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:17,419
Duchess Satine escaped again,
but I took out an informant.

153
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,419
Not sure if he successfully
delivered something to her,

154
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,299
but it looked like a handoff.

155
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,180
Find her. Whatever she's carrying
may compromise our plan.

156
00:12:39,822 --> 00:12:43,540
My lord, everything is going
as you instructed.

157
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,181
Death Watch is prepared to fight?

158
00:12:46,262 --> 00:12:50,541
Yes. The people have been worked
into such a frenzy

159
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,382
that when the Republic does arrive,

160
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:56,902
the Death Watch
will be considered heroes.

161
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:58,222
Excellent.

162
00:12:58,263 --> 00:13:03,022
The Republic occupation force is
loading their ships and will arrive on time,

163
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:06,703
if the Duchess Satine
does not get in the way.

164
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:10,583
The Duchess Satine
will not be in the way much longer.

165
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,944
One of the Death Watch assassins
is taking care of her.

166
00:13:17,184 --> 00:13:22,144
Uh, excuse me, sir. If you see this woman,
report her to the local authorities.

167
00:13:24,585 --> 00:13:28,105
Uh... You know, I don't think he
understands us. Let's try someone else.

168
00:13:30,585 --> 00:13:31,865
Obi-Wan, come in.

169
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,305
Obi-Wan, are you there?

170
00:13:34,425 --> 00:13:36,545
Satine! Where are you?

171
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,105
Mas Amedda has demanded
you turn yourself in.

172
00:13:39,226 --> 00:13:41,585
I know. Listen to me. Obi-Wan,

173
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,505
I need your help.

174
00:14:01,468 --> 00:14:03,507
Have you seen this woman?

175
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,628
Nice disguise.

176
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,589
Seeing you all right is...

177
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,549
Well, it's a relief.

178
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,589
You should turn yourself in.

179
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,230
We've both sworn a loyalty
to the Republic.

180
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,350
Believe me, neither one of us
is breaking our oath.

181
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:40,230
And this will prove it.
I need to get it into the proper hands.

182
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:45,630
But the Republic guards are hunting you,
which means...

183
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:49,151
Whoever doctored this recording
is likely in the government itself.

184
00:14:49,232 --> 00:14:51,791
If you set foot inside the Senate,
they'll take you.

185
00:14:51,872 --> 00:14:55,391
And the disk will be destroyed
before anyone can see it.

186
00:14:55,432 --> 00:14:57,792
Which is why
you must take the disk to Padmé.

187
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,673
Blast it.

188
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,313
Where will you be while I'm in the Senate?

189
00:15:24,395 --> 00:15:26,274
- What if they find you?
- They won't.

190
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:29,034
- I'm going to surrender to them.
- What?

191
00:15:29,115 --> 00:15:32,034
You'll need a distraction
to enter the Senate freely.

192
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:36,035
I can't risk them searching you
just because you and I are associates.

193
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:40,795
- I'm a Jedi. They wouldn't dare.
- Things are changing, my dear.

194
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,478
Obi!

195
00:16:48,921 --> 00:16:52,920
Excuse me.
I believe you were looking for me?

196
00:17:04,763 --> 00:17:09,802
The occupation of Mandalore will usher in
a new level of security for the Republic

197
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:12,522
and its fight against corruption.

198
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:15,883
- If there are no objections...
Supreme Chancellor.

199
00:17:15,923 --> 00:17:18,883
There has been a development
in the case for Mandalore's neutrality.

200
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:21,763
The chair recognizes
the senator from Naboo.

201
00:17:21,804 --> 00:17:25,883
I think this should cast a new light
on the so-called evidence we saw earlier.

202
00:17:31,444 --> 00:17:36,804
The actions by our government
have taken us into a period of civil war.

203
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:40,524
To acknowledge it
would be to invite panic in the streets.

204
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:43,725
Death Watch is far stronger
than we once thought.

205
00:17:43,805 --> 00:17:47,645
But we have been training for this.
We can stop them.

206
00:17:47,726 --> 00:17:49,805
But if we are to combat them effectively,

207
00:17:49,926 --> 00:17:53,886
we must have the temerity
to stand strong in the name of peace.

208
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:59,486
And if we are to do so,
we must reject any Republic assistance.

209
00:18:00,407 --> 00:18:03,726
Instead, this government will act.

210
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,966
It acts not out of pride, but for safety.

211
00:18:07,647 --> 00:18:11,567
Intervention by the Republic
will inflame the opposition,

212
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:15,447
and this is why our government
rejects the help of the Jedi.

213
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,527
We must listen to the Duchess Satine.

214
00:18:19,048 --> 00:18:23,088
If we do not,
we will ultimately cause our defeat.

215
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,048
All troops will stand down.

216
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:28,488
All troops will stand down!

217
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:31,329
Unacceptable! You promised us

218
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,409
we would reclaim Mandalore
from these weak-willed cowards!

219
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,329
I will order my men to attack.

220
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,209
And if you do,
you'll hold the planet for perhaps a day.

221
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,369
Without the backing of my forces
or your people,

222
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,529
your revolution will be over
before it begins.

223
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:53,570
A neophyte such as you
wouldn't know these things, but I do.

224
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:57,651
I have other ways to accomplish our goal.

225
00:19:05,572 --> 00:19:09,332
Thankfully, with the revelation
of this new information,

226
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:12,691
the occupation of Mandalore
is no longer necessary.

227
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:16,692
The person to thank is Duchess Satine.
She found the proof.

228
00:19:16,813 --> 00:19:18,652
I require no thanks.

229
00:19:20,853 --> 00:19:23,932
Satine, the Senate held
an emergency session,

230
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:27,212
and the Republic forces
have been ordered to stand down.

231
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:31,773
Allow me to offer a most sincere apology
on behalf of the entire Republic.

232
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:37,014
You are a most loyal servant,
and we are all grateful.

233
00:19:37,534 --> 00:19:39,413
Yes. Grateful.

234
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:44,054
Chancellor, if you and Mas Amedda
would join me for a moment,

235
00:19:44,175 --> 00:19:47,735
we have some logistics to discuss
in order to ratify the Senate's decision.

236
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,894
But for you, this wouldn't have happened.

237
00:19:51,976 --> 00:19:56,375
No, it was your unshakable faith
in your people, and your determination,

238
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:59,895
- that brought about this result.
- I appreciate that.

239
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:05,175
But still, who is behind all of this?
Who tampered with that recording?

240
00:20:05,257 --> 00:20:08,456
Who tried to convict me of murder
and throw me in jail?

241
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:13,496
I'm not sure, but as you said yourself,
things are changing.

242
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:18,376
And sometimes the line
between friend and foe is blurred.

243
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:20,177
Now more than ever.
