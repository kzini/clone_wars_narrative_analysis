1
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,290
<i>Mission accomplished!</i>

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,060
<i>Colonel Gascon and his droid squad</i>

3
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,560
<i>steal an encryption module</i>

4
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,230
<i>needed to crack a Separatist code</i>

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,400
<i>and stop an impending attack
on the Republic.</i>

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,930
<i>After surviving The Void</i>

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,770
<i>and escaping the hostile planet
of Abafar,</i>

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,910
<i>our heroes finally appear to be
headed in the right direction.</i>

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,260
Hmm, looks like the Jedi cruiser

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,160
is expecting this shuttle.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,300
Well, I'm sure there's someone aboard

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:54,170
who can put this encryption
module to good use.

13
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:57,040
Well, soldiers, this is the end
of the mission.

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,480
Colonel Gascon has succeeded.

15
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,210
R2, contact the bridge.

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,080
Tell them I request a meal
with the captain.

17
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,680
Nothing too fancy,
and, uh, I don't eat bantha.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,100
What do you mean you still
can't make contact?

19
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,830
I have got a bad feeling
about this, Colonel.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,300
Something is not right.

21
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,910
<i>Snogwash!</i>

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,320
It's probably just the effects
of The Void.

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,850
All that, uh, magnetic disruption

24
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,760
messed up his circuitry.

25
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,930
I will not allow your frivolous worrying

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,560
to undermine this...
this glorious moment!

27
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,470
I expect a hero's welcome,

28
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,940
not to mention my inevitable promotion

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,210
to P1 Brigadier!

30
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,000
Wow.

31
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,870
They really went overboard
on the welcoming committee.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,250
Good question, QT.

33
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,790
Why are there not any other
shuttles or crew members?

34
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,090
Well, everyone's probably
preparing to, uh...

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,466
Well, they'll all want to be there

36
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:27,830
when we break the Separatist code.

37
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,470
How should I know why
all the blast doors are shut?

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,570
That's a question
for the captain of this ship

39
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,880
and one I intend to ask
just as soon as I find him.

40
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,360
Sergeant, Colonel Meebur Gascon.

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,660
You have no doubt been expecting me.

42
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,860
I am delivering the Separatist
encryption module.

43
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,270
Why... it's just a hologram.

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,020
What in the blazes is going on here?

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,390
I do not know.

46
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,360
But we just made the jump to hyperspace,

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,970
which means somebody
is navigating this ship.

48
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,780
You, droids!

49
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,850
What are you doing on our ship?

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Surrender or you will be destroyed.

51
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,790
Battle droids!

52
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,510
Whoo... ahh!

53
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,670
The commander wants the detonator

54
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,740
taken to the control room.

55
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,940
Roger, roger.

56
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,610
Okay, let me just...

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Lift with your legs!
Lift with your legs!

58
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,120
Uh, heavy, heavy.

59
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,390
Watch it, watch it! Look out!

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,020
Good thinking back there.

61
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,560
But next time <i>I</i> give the orders.
Understood?

62
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:10,930
I got it.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
I got it.

64
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,840
I don't got it!

65
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,900
Yaah!

66
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,910
Uh-oh.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,450
I wasn't programmed for this.

68
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,150
Stop! Which way are we going?

69
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,530
Down here!

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,200
Aah!

71
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:45,280
Have you seen the intruders?

72
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,980
They went that way?

73
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,220
Roger, roger.

74
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,930
All right, something
very strange is going on here.

75
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,160
It appears this ship has been
hijacked by Separatists.

76
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,540
What do you mean it doesn't belong here?

77
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,010
He is right, Colonel.

78
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,540
This is not Republic technology.

79
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,380
Not unless they have lowered
their standards.

80
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,250
Well, what exactly do you think it is?

81
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,150
A bomb?

82
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,820
What kind of a bomb? Is it on?

83
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,130
How long do we have? Talk to me!

84
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,630
What do you mean the ship is a bomb?

85
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,540
How can the entire ship be a bomb?

86
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,130
Mother of Kwath...

87
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,790
There must be enough rhydonium in here

88
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,430
to blow up the entire Republic fleet.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,350
I don't know what any of this means,

90
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,290
but I want off this ship immediately.

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,200
My mission is over.

92
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:14,700
I had no orders to stop
Separatist piracy

93
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,210
or disarm massive,
titanic-scale bombs!

94
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,810
C4 has a good point.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,250
If we do not stop this ship
before it explodes,

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,830
it could cost the Republic
thousands of lives.

97
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,800
Pure speculation.

98
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,500
We're evacuating this ship,
and that is an order!

99
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,700
Oh, right.

100
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,800
We'll have to wait to evacuate

101
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,170
until the ship is out of hyperspace.

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,440
By then it could be too late.

103
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,410
Once we get where we are going,
my guess is...

104
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,750
kaboom!

105
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Wait!

106
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,387
I...

107
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,870
no...

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,780
okay, okay!

109
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,320
I don't know, QT.

110
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,590
Where is R2 gone now?

111
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
What's going on? Who is this?

112
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,510
I am BNI-393,
an LEP Servant Droid.

113
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,880
My master called me Bunny.

114
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,410
And where is your master?

115
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,750
He was killed

116
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,250
when the Separatists
took control of this ship.

117
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,690
Why were you hiding from us?

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,290
At first I did not know
if I could trust you.

119
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,690
Then I was not sure
you would believe me.

120
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,600
Once you saw the truth,

121
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:53,040
I was simply hoping
you would abandon ship

122
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,440
and take the rest of us with you.

123
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,487
Rest of you?

124
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:57,640
You're telling me

125
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,740
there's more
Republic crew members on board?

126
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,520
Did you destroy the intruders?

127
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,800
Uh, no.

128
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,090
There are Republic droids on this ship

129
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,920
that could ruin our plans.

130
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,230
You will search the entire ship
until the intruders are found

131
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,370
and report back to me.

132
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,070
Is this a joke?

133
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,900
The rest of the crew is in our shuttle?

134
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,160
I told them to wait inside

135
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,470
and that we would be leaving

136
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,070
as soon as we came out of hyperspace.

137
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,460
You can come out now.

138
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,750
It is okay.

139
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,300
These are the other crew members?

140
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,600
As you can see,

141
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,000
none of us can pilot the shuttle,

142
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,940
which is why we needed you.

143
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,440
Why you need <i>me</i>.

144
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,486
Hi, there.

145
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,510
I am the pilot.

146
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,020
What is this Separatist plot?

147
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,500
I do not know the details.

148
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,920
I was only able to steal the coordinates

149
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,990
of their target.

150
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,360
Target?

151
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,260
You mean they aren't just
planning to blow up this ship?

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,730
I do not believe so.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,100
The coordinates are a space station

154
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,740
in the Carida system.

155
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,786
What?

156
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,810
That's the site

157
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,780
of the Republic Strategy Conference.

158
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,520
How do I know?

159
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,080
I was putting the finishing touches

160
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,250
on a report for that conference

161
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,960
when I was assigned this mission.

162
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,660
The Jedi Council will be there,

163
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,900
along with Republic officers
from around the galaxy and...

164
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,370
What the...

165
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,910
The Separatists are going to ram
the station with this ship!

166
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,657
I agree.

167
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,680
We have to do something, R2.

168
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,560
See if you can send a transmission

169
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,590
to the Republic so we can warn them.

170
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,880
It is no use.

171
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,420
We have tried that.

172
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,620
All transmissions from this ship
are being blocked.

173
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,730
Hmm, you're right.

174
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,900
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

175
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,580
Where's he going?

176
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,617
Uh-oh.

177
00:10:28,641 --> 00:10:30,810
That buzz droid is not with me.

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,940
It must be a spy!

179
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,780
Stop that droid!

180
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,870
Where'd he go?
We've got to find him.

181
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,380
I do not know.
I do not see him anywhere.

182
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,580
Uh, Colonel...

183
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,250
I think I see him.

184
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,150
I think I see a whole lot of him.

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,560
It's a trap!

186
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,260
Good work.
You've established a perimeter.

187
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,930
There are still more coming!

188
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,440
Please tell me you have
a brilliant strategy, Colonel!

189
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,710
I don't know!
There's just so many of them.

190
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,580
What do you mean, "get out"?

191
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,590
All right, what are you going to do?

192
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,490
You are going to open the air lock?

193
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,130
Are you crazy, BZ?

194
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,450
Everybody, magnetize your feet!

195
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,620
Lock down!

196
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,860
BZ! Magnetize!

197
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,660
Magnetize!

198
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:49,760
No!

199
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,580
R2, close the door!

200
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,350
Close the door!

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,430
Poor BZ.

202
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,970
You will be missed, soldier.

203
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,500
R2 is right.

204
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,540
Colonel, would you say something
to honor this heroic sacrifice?

205
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:29,150
I suppose that's appropriate.

206
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,250
I'll have to make it quick
because we don't have much time.

207
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,660
When this D-Squad
started our mission,

208
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,220
I had doubts.

209
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,760
Grave doubts that we would ever survive,

210
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,660
let alone succeed.

211
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,600
But we worked together.

212
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,030
We didn't give up hope.

213
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,640
We showed courage in the face of death.

214
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,610
It shocks me to say this,

215
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,710
but we make an excellent team.

216
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,480
Now we've lost one of our members...

217
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,780
BZ.

218
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,550
But we must remember.

219
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,190
BZ sacrificed himself for us.

220
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,530
That's what a good soldier does
sometimes.

221
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,170
The only way to honor that sacrifice

222
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,930
is to stop this ship

223
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,700
and prevent the Separatists

224
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,210
from taking any more Republic lives.

225
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Are you with me?

226
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,670
Have the buzz droids
reported back in yet?

227
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,500
No, there has been no signal from them.

228
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,880
In fact, I cannot even locate
their signal anymore.

229
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,180
We must assume, then,

230
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,290
that the buzz droids have failed.

231
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,050
I want those intruders found
before they ruin our plans.

232
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,320
- Roger, roger.
- Roger, roger.

233
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,460
All right, everybody knows the plan?

234
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,670
We get the injured droids to the shuttle

235
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,040
and distract the battle droids

236
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,370
while R2 goes up to the detonator

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,510
and programs it to explode early.

238
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,540
Hopefully he can make it
back to the shuttle

239
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:59,550
and we can all get off the ship
before it blows up.

240
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,420
Good luck, R2.

241
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,830
The intruders! Destroy them!

242
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,850
You can make it!

243
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,920
Hurry! Hurry!

244
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,320
We have our target in sight.

245
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,790
Full ahead.

246
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,930
Ramming speed.

247
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,430
Evacuation plan is now under way.

248
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,810
I will go to the detonator
and start the countdown.

249
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,896
The worst part about our job

250
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:17,180
are these boring strategy conferences.

251
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,520
Cheer up, Anakin.

252
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,590
This is your chance to voice
all your complaints

253
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,420
about military protocol.

254
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,460
And it looks as though
we can finally get under way.

255
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,830
I will inform Master Windu
the last straggler has arrived

256
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,570
while you work on your attitude.

257
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,510
Isn't that ship coming in
a little too fast?

258
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,320
There's the shuttle!

259
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,470
Careful, you'll hit the rhydonium.

260
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,370
Everyone, head to the ship!

261
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,470
C4 and I will distract them.

262
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,910
You are too late.

263
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
Once the detonation sequence
has commenced,

264
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,720
there is no stopping it.

265
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,120
Now let's see if R2 made it
to the detonator.

266
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,160
R2 is in trouble!

267
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,230
Come on!

268
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,200
R2 will never make it back
to the shuttle in time.

269
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,010
We've got to delay the launch.

270
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,850
The cruiser has not slowed its pace.

271
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,980
Have you been able to contact
their captain?

272
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,700
Z9 says he cannot make contact
with anyone.

273
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,060
Where's R2 when I need him?

274
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,280
We've got to regroup
and head back for R2.

275
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,380
Well, we're changing the plan!

276
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,020
No one gets left behind,

277
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,030
and we're not leaving until I say so!

278
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,060
Prepare for liftoff!

279
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,350
No. It is too soon.

280
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,290
We are scanning a large amount
of rhydonium on that ship!

281
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,560
It's a bomb.

282
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,180
And you thought
this conference would be boring.

283
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,690
Mayday! Mayday!

284
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,160
Space station Valor,

285
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,160
this is Colonel Meebur Gascon.

286
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,230
Can anyone hear me?

287
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,400
We read you, Colonel.

288
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,930
This is General Skywalker.

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,330
What's going on out there?

290
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,900
Slight change in our mission, General.

291
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,970
The droids and I were stowaways
on that cruiser.

292
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,410
Where's R2?

293
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,950
I'm sorry to report he was on that ship

294
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,550
when it blew up, sir.

295
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,980
He just saved all your lives.

296
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,960
I want a salvage team out there now!

297
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,800
R2!

299
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,450
You made it, buddy!

300
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,310
Hey, you're a big hero.

301
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,760
There's someone here
who wants to speak to you.

302
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,130
R2D2, are we glad to see you.

303
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,700
I am most glad.

304
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,830
Quiet, WAC. I'm talking here.

305
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,040
Yes, sir, Colonel.

306
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,940
In truth, I might just be a map reader,

307
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,320
and I don't have much battle experience,

308
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,550
but, R2,

309
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,320
you are the bravest droid
I have ever met.

310
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,790
You all are.

311
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,730
I would be proud to serve
with you droids

312
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,630
anytime, anywhere.

313
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,370
Oh, I am glad to hear you
say that, Colonel,

314
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,810
because I hear we have been
assigned to the same platoon!

315
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
We will be seeing each other every day

316
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
for the rest of the war!

317
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,920
That's great, WAC.
