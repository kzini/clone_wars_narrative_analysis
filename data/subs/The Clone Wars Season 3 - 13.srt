1
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,320
A bid for revenge!

2
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,200
Betrayed and left for dead
by Count Dooku,

3
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:25,960
Asajj Ventress has begun a deadly game
with her former master,

4
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,420
launching a secret assassination attempt
against him

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,090
with the help of her kin,
the mysterious Nightsisters.

6
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,230
Deceived into believing
the Jedi are behind the recent attack,

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,090
Dooku has traveled across the galaxy
to enlist the Nightsisters

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,010
in his quest for vengeance.

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,780
Mother Talzin.

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,860
Count Dooku.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,580
Come, we have much to discuss.

12
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:12,180
Thank you for receiving me, Sister.

13
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,340
I believe the old alliance can again be
what it once was.

14
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,150
You would only have to pledge your clan's
allegiance to the Separatists' cause.

15
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,310
We could certainly use the powers
of the Nightsisters against the Jedi.

16
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,770
Such a generous offer, Count.

17
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:36,030
But our loyalty is reserved
for only each other.

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,500
The only reason I am aiding
in your search for a new assassin

19
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,200
is because, long ago,
you chose to help me.

20
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,660
After this matter is resolved,

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,670
I hope our paths never cross again.

22
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,340
As you wish, Sister.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,720
Drink.

24
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:11,900
You must gather your strength
after such a long journey.

25
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,060
Thank you.

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,650
Blackroot, to replenish the body.

27
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:25,580
You have heard of the Sith Warrior
Darth Maul, have you not?

28
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,090
Yes. He was slain on Naboo
at the hand of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

29
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,560
A few still remain in his bloodline.

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,590
The men dwell on the far side of Dathomir.

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,760
What if I could provide
another of his kind?

32
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,930
A warrior of the same caliber?

33
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,390
Yes.

34
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,770
But I warn you,

35
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,980
men are easy to acquire, hard to control.

36
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,450
With my last assassin,
Asajj Ventress, dead,

37
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,490
and the Jedis' attacks against me
increasing,

38
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,960
procuring a new personal assassin
is essential.

39
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:16,130
Very well. It shall be done, my Lord.

40
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,640
So he has agreed
to take another apprentice.

41
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,970
A barbarian, no less.

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,850
A man who we will deliver to the Count

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,530
with all of the training and skill
an assassin can possess.

44
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,500
This warrior
must have no loyalty to Dooku.

45
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,160
He will be our pawn.

46
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,700
Yes.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,210
Yes!

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,170
We will use our magicks
to manipulate his assassin,

49
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,500
and when the time is right...

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,170
Dooku will pay for his betrayal,

51
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,880
with his life.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:10,510
You will go to the far side of Dathomir
and find the men.

53
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:14,230
You will select
the most suitable candidate,

54
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,690
one with your strength and skill,

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,900
one we can use to our advantage.

56
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,610
Yes, Mother.

57
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,230
Welcome, Sister.

58
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,780
I have come for the selection.

59
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,250
Yes, yes, of course.

60
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:13,410
Line up! Heads of each tribe!
Line up for the Sister!

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,410
Feral,
try not to draw attention to yourself.

62
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,330
That won't be a problem for me, Savage.

63
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,270
What a fine-looking specimen.

64
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,900
But looks aren't everything.

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,080
Too small.

66
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,630
Too weak.

67
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,380
These will do.

68
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,720
Him.

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,850
And him.

70
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:22,980
These men are to your liking, Sister?

71
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,610
Yes.

72
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
Now for the tests.

73
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,160
There will be three of them.
Whoever survives will be my champion

74
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,990
and go on to serve me.

75
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,780
Understood?

76
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,540
- Yes, Sister!
- Yes, Sister!

77
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:42,750
Excellent! Let the games begin!

78
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,810
We must be vigilant, Feral.

79
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,230
Aren't I always?

80
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,120
Feral!

81
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,620
Brother, get up!

82
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,260
The witch, where is she?

83
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,710
Pathetic!

84
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,890
Where are the warriors I came for?

85
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,260
Is this all the power these men possess?

86
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,520
In order to fight against the Force,

87
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,940
you must see what cannot be seen.

88
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,780
Only four of you remain.

89
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,160
Who will be the first to fall?

90
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,360
Not fast enough!

91
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,340
Show yourself!

92
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,850
Good.

93
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,690
Let the third and final challenge begin!

94
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:01,030
There are only two of us left, brother,

95
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,700
but only one will survive.

96
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,080
No, not if I can help it.

97
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,960
Stick together. We must work as a team.

98
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,730
Go!

99
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,420
Savage!

100
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,670
As long as I live,

101
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,460
you will not harm him!

102
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,850
Please. Spare him. Take me.

103
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,020
Leave us.

104
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,040
My life is yours.

105
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,040
Yes, it is.

106
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:32,080
He has surrendered his life to me.

107
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,170
This one is strong.

108
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,220
A perfect male specimen.

109
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,810
Such hate!

110
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,020
The sheer power of it.

111
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,560
A tremendous gift
from the galaxy, Mother.

112
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,270
He will serve us well.

113
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:08,130
He is ready, Sisters.

114
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,090
Look at the strength in him!

115
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,800
The power!

116
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,400
Let me go!

117
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,030
Calmly, Sister.

118
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,620
Let me go.

119
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,840
That's better.

120
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,470
Bring in the prisoner!

121
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,350
Now for the final test.

122
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,940
Savage?

123
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,280
Kill him.

124
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,820
Savage, you know me.

125
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,990
I am your kin!

126
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:22,000
Do not do this!

127
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,620
I said, kill him!

128
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,130
No!

129
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,460
Brother!

130
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,100
Brother, please!

131
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,300
You beg?

132
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,190
Weakling!

133
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,600
Savage!

134
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,660
Good.

135
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,020
Very good.

136
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,070
You will learn to draw your strength
from your emotions.

137
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,040
Hate will feed you.

138
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,620
Never sympathize with the enemy,
not even for a moment.

139
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,210
Yes, Sister.

140
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:10,790
For you, an enchanted blade,

141
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:15,590
blessed with our most potent magicks.

142
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,220
I think it's time we introduce
the apprentice to his new master.

143
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,720
Wouldn't you agree?

144
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,490
At last.

145
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,510
Sister.

146
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,640
Count Dooku, may I present.

147
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,100
Savage Oppress.

148
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,200
He certainly is a sight to behold.

149
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,500
The fiercest of his kind, my Lord.

150
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,790
He shall serve you well.

151
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:35,840
Yes, he shall.

152
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:48,890
Mother Talzin speaks very highly
of your skills.

153
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:54,190
Still, I require proof
of your abilities as a warrior.

154
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,820
The Jedi are in control of a vital outpost
on the jungle planet of Devaron.

155
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:03,570
A temple.

156
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,170
A temple?

157
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,490
Do not be fooled, Savage.

158
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,830
The Temple of Eedit serves only as a front

159
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,050
for the military
operations of the Republic.

160
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,090
It is essential that we seize the Temple

161
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,840
if the Separatists ever hope to take
control of that corner of the galaxy.

162
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:27,600
You shall go to Devaron
and take what is rightfully ours.

163
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,560
Yes, my Lord.

164
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,380
Get him!

165
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,570
Jedi!

166
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,360
- Master?
- Stay back!

167
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,330
No!

168
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,180
- My Lord.
- Is it finished?

169
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,600
Yes. The Temple has been taken.

170
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,430
- And the Jedi?
- Dead.

171
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,350
Very impressive, Savage.

172
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:01,690
Return to Serenno immediately.

173
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,780
Very well, my Lord.

174
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,950
You have done well, Savage.

175
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,910
I'll have much use for you.

176
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,330
Thank you, my Lord.

177
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,340
I foresee we will do great things together.

178
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,430
I shall teach you the
ways of the dark side.

179
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,770
Soon your powers will rival
that of the great Sith Lord Darth Maul.

180
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,860
We will be even more powerful
than Lord Sidious.

181
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,240
We shall rule the galaxy together,
my apprentice.

182
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:53,410
I am your servant, Master.
