1
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,450
Mysterious deaths!

2
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:21,130
Unknown to the Jedi,

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,910
a new threat has been unleashed
on the galaxy,

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,290
Savage Opress,
a pawn in the dangerous game

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,590
between Count Dooku
and his former assassin, Ventress.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,960
The victims of his brutal massacre
on the planet of Devaron

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,550
are being returned to the Jedi Temple
for evaluation.

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,470
It's up to the Jedi Council
to find this mysterious killer

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,310
and eradicate him.

10
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,330
There were no survivors on Devaron.
Everyone was killed,

11
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,330
including Master Halsey and his Padawan.

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,500
In the past, only Dooku's assassin
was capable of such an effort.

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:12,090
But she was presumed dead
at the battle of Sullust.

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,310
Not everything is what it seems.
There may be a new threat.

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,510
Someone or something has eluded us,

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,010
perhaps a newly appointed Sith Lord.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,940
This is not the work of a Sith Lord
or a Jedi,

18
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,350
but a reckless, impulsive animal.

19
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,050
You have no technique.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,680
Sloppy.

21
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,900
But with the proper training,
you could be a powerful warrior.

22
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,250
You have a natural ability,
but we must hone it.

23
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:23,280
Are you up for the challenge
of putting your hate to better use?

24
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,200
Yes, Master.

25
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,080
Master Yoda, you called for me?

26
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,590
Master Kenobi.
Show you something we must.

27
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,300
We have recovered surveillance footage
of the massacre on Devaron.

28
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,510
Darth Maul alive?

29
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,640
It can't be! I killed him myself!

30
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:52,310
Correct you are, Obi-Wan.

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,900
A creature of the same species he is,
from Dathomir.

32
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,110
Dathomir? The planet of the witches?

33
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,040
I was under the impression that
Darth Maul's home world was Iridonia.

34
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,570
Dathomir is the planet
where Maul was raised.

35
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,170
Iridonia is where the rest of the males
of the species dwell.

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,670
Travel to Dathomir you must.

37
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,670
Find the source of this threat you will.

38
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,770
You must strengthen your connection
with the Force, my apprentice.

39
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,640
Feel its power within you.

40
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,700
Now, lift them.

41
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,330
Concentrate!

42
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,260
What you ask is impossible!

43
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,390
Impossible?

44
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,720
The task is only impossible
because you have deemed it so!

45
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,100
You must connect with your hatred!

46
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,530
Focus on your power building.

47
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,530
Do not think of anyone or anything else.

48
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,740
That's it!

49
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,210
Your anger is your strength!

50
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,750
I hate you!

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,380
Good.

52
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,100
How does one defend against such power?

53
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,820
A wise master does not reveal
all his secrets at once.

54
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,530
In due time, my apprentice.

55
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,120
There's the village.

56
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,390
Be on guard.

57
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,680
These men are ferocious warriors
and they will show no mercy.

58
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,780
Don't worry! I won't start anything.

59
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Let me handle the negotiations.

60
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,450
So much for not starting something.

61
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,910
Hey, don't look at me!

62
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,880
Don't harm them.

63
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,340
Don't tell me, tell them!

64
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,430
Back off!

65
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,020
We are not here to fight you!

66
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,190
We're here for information.

67
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,150
A man from your village
murdered two Jedi.

68
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,320
We need to know where he is.

69
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:30,070
What makes you think he's one of ours?

70
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,820
The Jedi Council knows
he's from this village.

71
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,490
We have seen him.

72
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,090
Mother Talzin should know
of his whereabouts.

73
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,500
One of her women took him as a mate.

74
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,750
I apologize for the intrusion, then.

75
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,380
Anakin, kindly release him, please.

76
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,100
Stop!

77
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,520
Let them go.

78
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Who is this Mother Talzin?

79
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,820
She's the leader of an ancient
order of witches, the Nightsisters.

80
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:09,990
Great. Warrior-like men, witches.

81
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,040
This place is all kinds of fun.

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,660
I'm glad you think so.

83
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,390
You have completed
the first stages of your training

84
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,840
and I am sending you
on an assignment to Toydaria.

85
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,760
You will bring me King Katuunko, alive.

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Kill all who might interfere.

87
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,810
Yes, my master. It will be done.

88
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,180
I don't know much of Mother Talzin,
but I don't expect to be welcome here.

89
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,840
You never know.
I tend to be popular with the ladies.

90
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,060
Too popular.

91
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,270
We've got company.

92
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,830
Jedi, come with us.

93
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,390
Master Kenobi.

94
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:04,390
Mother Talzin,
thank you for your hospitality.

95
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:07,640
I believe you have a question for me.

96
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
Yes, you're right.

97
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,900
We've had reports of a Dathomiri male
on the loose.

98
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,190
He's already killed two Jedi.

99
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,280
Perhaps you know who he is?

100
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,620
Master Jedi,
we have no control over the males.

101
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,080
Our clan has been in exile for years.

102
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,710
Don't play innocent with me, Mother.

103
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,010
Everyone in the galaxy knows
females are dominant on this planet.

104
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:36,170
I do not believe anything happens here
without your clan knowing about it.

105
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,640
To think that the Jedi collect their facts
from mere rumors.

106
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,560
Rumors? You call two dead Jedi rumors?

107
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,020
This thing, this animal,
is extremely dangerous.

108
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:56,110
If you have any information about
his whereabouts, you must tell us.

109
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Savage. Savage Opress.

110
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
Mother?

111
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,620
He is on Toydaria.

112
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,370
Thank you.

113
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,050
The time has come, sister.

114
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,800
You must put your plot against Dooku
into effect now.

115
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,220
He isn't ready, Mother.
He needs more training.

116
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,430
He has to be ready.

117
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,310
Together, the two of you
will be able to eliminate the Count.

118
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,110
But you must act now.

119
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,210
We cannot keep your new assassin
a secret forever.

120
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,160
I will have my revenge.

121
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,530
You will, sister.

122
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
You will.

123
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,580
Your Highness,
there is an intruder at the door!

124
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,870
Stop him!

125
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,310
I will not be intimidated.

126
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,350
At last.

127
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,190
- I guess that's what's left of our ship.
- We'll borrow one from the Toydarians.

128
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,060
You ignorant beast!

129
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,900
I told you I wanted him alive!

130
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,200
Forgive me, my master.

131
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,580
That is not the way of the dark side.

132
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,550
- Ventress!
- That's no way to treat your apprentice.

133
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,840
I should know.

134
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:34,980
Savage, you can make amends
for your mistake

135
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,560
by destroying this witch.

136
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,400
I don't think that will be happening.
Will it, Savage?

137
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,540
Remember where your true loyalties lie.

138
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,500
With you, mistress.

139
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,250
Look, a Separatist Dreadnaught.
The King's murderer must have fled there.

140
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:06,130
Dooku sent his assassin to exact
his revenge on the Toydarians.

141
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,840
We'll make him pay for it.

142
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,520
Halt! You are now...

143
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,850
Finish him! Now!

144
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,120
Get up! We must defeat him!

145
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,910
Get up!

146
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,670
Kill him! Kill him, you fool!

147
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,180
I can't. He's too powerful.

148
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,070
Your weakness will not be my downfall.

149
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,770
A failed apprentice
makes for a foolish master.

150
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
Savage, no!

151
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,850
- We'll take him together.
- Right.

152
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,150
Leaving so soon, Master?

153
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:42,330
You are no match for me
without the aid of your monster.

154
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Hmm...

155
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,700
That remains to be seen.

156
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,580
As you wish.

157
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:19,280
Time to end this once and for all.

158
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:49,270
Commander. Savage Opress is a traitor.
Destroy him.

159
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,770
Roger, roger.

160
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,700
They're not after us!

161
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,660
They're attacking that monster!

162
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,140
You're not supposed to be here.

163
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,930
No sense in hanging around here.

164
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,430
My thoughts exactly.

165
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,010
You have come home to us.

166
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,730
I was betrayed by Ventress.
The Jedi are after me!

167
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,900
I'm not nearly strong enough
to defeat them all!

168
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,770
Calm yourself.

169
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,900
You will be.

170
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,750
I don't understand. Who will teach me?

171
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,030
You have a brother.

172
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,200
A brother?

173
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,870
But all of my kin were killed!

174
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,960
Not all of them.

175
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,750
He lives in the Outer Rim, in exile.

176
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,390
You will find him.

177
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,010
He will teach you
everything you need to learn

178
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,930
to become even more powerful.

179
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,680
My brother.

180
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,890
How?

181
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,020
How will I find him?

182
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,110
This talisman has been imbued
with the power of our clan.

183
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,780
It will be your compass.

184
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,580
You have an important destiny to fulfill,
Savage Opress.

185
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,460
You and your brother.

186
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:23,000
Go. You will know where to find him.

187
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,170
I will return, Mother.
