1
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,030
<i>Homeward bound.</i>

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,790
<i>On a peaceful relief mission
to the рlаnet Aleen,</i>

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,960
<i>R2-D2 аnd C-3PО</i>

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,630
<i>were саught uр in аn аdventure
beуond their сomрrehension.</i>

5
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,140
<i>After finаllу resolving the сrisis</i>

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,140
<i>аnd being tаken
to Jedi Master Adi Gallia's сruiser,</i>

7
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,300
<i>theу now heаd home
towаrd the sаfetу of the Reрubliс,</i>

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,550
<i>hoping to avoid a Separatist attack.</i>

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,600
And Mistress Padmé,

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,020
you would not believe

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,810
the adventures Artoo and I had
on that troubled planet ofAleen.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,350
We have been
in the most absurd situations.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,900
I could never compute.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,360
<i>Well, I told уou, Threeрio,
it's а big universe out there,</i>

15
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,460
<i>beуond the few million рlаnets уou know.</i>

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,700
And obviously, for the most part,
quite uncivilized.

17
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,840
I hope never to end up on a mission
of that nature again.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,790
<i>Good. I need you here
to suрervise the senаtoriаl bаnquet.</i>

19
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,290
<i>It wаs рushed uр
аnd is only two dаys аwаy.</i>

20
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,340
Oh, my!

21
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,930
They've hit the main reactor,
prepare to evacuate.

22
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,060
Non-essential personnel
<i>evасuаte immediаtelу.</i>

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,150
<i>Non-essentiаl рersonnel
evасuаte immediаtelу.</i>

24
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,610
Did you hear that?

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,110
We've got to get out of here.

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,870
It's General Grievous!

27
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,460
Artoo, where are you going?

28
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,130
We need to find an escape pod.

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,800
<i>All рilots to уour stаtions.
All flight сrews, mаn уour stаtions.</i>

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,720
<i>Move to уour stаtions!</i>

31
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,810
<i>All flight сrews, mаn уour stаtions.</i>

32
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,070
R2-D2, get down from there at once.

33
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,900
This is not an escape pod.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,700
Well, if there's nothing better, I suppose,
it will just have to do.

35
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm sure I will live to...

36
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:39,550
Artoo, you should know I have
total confidence in your skills as a pilot,

37
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,430
provided you can avoid these star cruisers.
Oh, my!

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
Avoid them the other way!

39
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,820
Artoo, do something! Get us out of here!

40
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
They're right behind us!

41
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,800
We've been hit! Ah!

42
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,240
Right on target! Well done, Artoo.

43
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,450
Oh, no! The reactor was hit,
it's shutting down.

44
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,580
We'll disintegrate for sure.

45
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,510
Fixable? This scrap pile?

46
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:12,020
Without the tools,
this ship is utterly useless!

47
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,140
I suppose, we could get out
and have a look around.

48
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,820
Oh, really. You see, not even a ladder.

49
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,360
Utterly useless! Utterly!

50
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,820
Look, look! Over there!

51
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,030
- Intruders!
- Oh!

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,830
- Shiny!
- It's shiny!

53
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,870
Intruders!

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,670
Did you hear that?

55
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,840
Whoever you are,
please note that my counterpart here

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,890
is programmed
in 47 schools of self-defense.

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,190
There, I've frightened them off.

58
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,080
Fear not, Artoo, just little creatures.

59
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,750
Can't possibly damage us!

60
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:17,410
Oh! Oh! Oh!

61
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,470
Get the Big Hay-Zu. He'll know what to do.

62
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,640
Really!

63
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,320
May I say that this is no way
to treat a friendly visitor to your planet.

64
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,610
The Big Hay-Zu says
there are no friendly visitors.

65
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:53,280
This Hay-Zu doesn't sound very reasonable.

66
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:58,710
We do what he says, whatever he says,
for our own good.

67
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,000
Your own good?

68
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,340
He sends our children to fight his wars,
the lucky ones.

69
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,130
What does he do to the unlucky ones?

70
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,780
So, you are the intruders?

71
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,250
Intruders? Oh, hardly,
Your Worshipful-ness! We are...

72
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,580
On this planet,
things are what Hay-Zu says they are!

73
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,170
Quiet, Artoo.

74
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,960
What's this? Your friend challenges
Big Hay-Zu's authority!

75
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,170
Sir, my disagreeable friend here
means no disrespect.

76
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,930
We are just trying
to get back to our home planet,

77
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,600
but our ship is damaged.

78
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,430
And I fear, repaired or not,

79
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,690
that further travel in it might not result
in our arrival there unscathed.

80
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,190
That's the chance you'll have to take.

81
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,690
Now get off my planet
while I'm in a good mood,

82
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,540
or I'll have you dismembered
and sold for scrap.

83
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,570
Free them!

84
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:27,130
Ah, big talk for a small droid!

85
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,250
Artoo, have your sensors frozen?

86
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,090
I am not going to let you at him!

87
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,720
In fact, I'm going to switch you off
before you cause an intergalactic incident.

88
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,530
Oh, my!

89
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,480
You just killed him.

90
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,570
Dead. He's dead. The Big Hay-Zu is dead.

91
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,530
You must understand this was an accident,
a terrible accident.

92
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,580
He's dead! He's dead!

93
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,580
The Big Hay-Zu is dead!

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,290
He's dead! He's dead!

95
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,080
The Big Hay-Zu is dead!

96
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,770
Gold one, we have a proposition.

97
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,020
We wish you not to leave,
but for you to stay,

98
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,770
as our new leader.

99
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,940
A lot you know,
you over-stuffed barrel of bolts.

100
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,280
I could be a leader.

101
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,950
I am honored by your consideration

102
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,120
but you should choose a leader
from among your own.

103
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,960
None of us has killed Hay-Zu.
None of us have earned the title.

104
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,580
Terminating the big one
does not anoint me leader.

105
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,290
You must choose.

106
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,170
Now, who are the three smartest,
most intelligent,

107
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,470
most understanding, most compassionate?

108
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,190
You should choose a leader
from among these three.

109
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,730
Who thinks he should be leader?

110
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,980
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,440
And this young lady?

112
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,110
Yeah!

113
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,740
Lastly, him.

114
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,820
Yeah!

115
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,000
Congratulations!
You are now a democracy.

116
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,790
- I got more votes than he did.
- No, you didn't!

117
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,460
- Sit down! It was me! It was me!
- I got the most votes.

118
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,726
- That is not true.
- Ridiculous!

119
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,840
No!

120
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,010
No, it was me.

121
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,010
I heartily agree. Is the ship ready?

122
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,420
Then we'll just have to risk it,

123
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,520
and leave them
to build their happy democracy,

124
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,640
on their own.

125
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,320
I got the votes!

126
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,350
Down with democracy!

127
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,050
Yes, I'm reading the gauges.
I have nothing to do but read gauges.

128
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,550
Why? What do the gauges say?

129
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,050
Running out of power?
The ship and us, too!

130
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,260
Oh, I knew we should never
have left the Jedi cruiser.

131
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,680
Another planet?

132
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,410
According to the positional
system coordinates,

133
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,990
this is Balnab,

134
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,160
a stellar remnant in its emerging stages
of organic development.

135
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:54,920
I've heard terrible stories
about these primitive planets.

136
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,090
I dare not imagine

137
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,260
what is beginning to swim
in their primordial soups.

138
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,100
I know we have to find power.
But do we have to find it out there?

139
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,820
Afraid? Of course I'm not afraid.

140
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,900
I am now.

141
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,620
Quickly, see if your scanners
can find a viable power source.

142
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:37,590
Yes, me, too.

143
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:41,130
Life forms? What kind?

144
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,100
They appear to be humanoid
and completely devoid of intelligence.

145
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,610
Artoo, make a dash for it!

146
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,660
What are they?

147
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,000
Bring them. The leader will know.

148
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,170
Another leader? Oh!

149
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:22,010
I do hope this one is more understanding.

150
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,560
My fault! Ha! I should have known.

151
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,040
<i>Who dаres сome to mу lаnd?</i>

152
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,830
Just two wandering droids
searching to find their home!

153
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,790
<i>Droids? What are droids?</i>

154
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:00,500
Well, kind sir,
droids are mechanical beings

155
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,250
possessing artificial intelligence,
designed to make...

156
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,510
<i>- Silence!</i>
- At once, sir.

157
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:09,260
Your Sir-ness, being silent
is one of my specialties.

158
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,980
<i>Who dаres to bring these non-living things
before me?</i>

159
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,400
It was I who brought
them. I thought that...

160
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,570
How unfortunate.

161
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,240
<i>No one thinks here but me!</i>

162
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,910
Artoo, be quiet.

163
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:36,330
This situation calls
for my most delicate diplomatic skills.

164
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,080
Please excuse my insolent friend,
Your Eminence-ness,

165
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,130
but I know a holographic image...

166
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,420
<i>I know not of уour blаsрhemу.</i>

167
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
<i>Perhарs "hologrарhiс" is the
inсorreсt word in уour nаtive tongue,</i>

168
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,690
<i>but it is obvious thаt уou аre not reаl.</i>

169
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,940
<i>Not real!</i>

170
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,650
<i>I'll show уou not reаl!</i>

171
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,450
Hey, what are you doing back here?

172
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,870
<i>I sаid whаt аre уou doing bасk here?</i>

173
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,620
Back where?

174
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,880
Help you? Whereabouts...

175
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,470
We're not gonna help you.

176
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,010
We worked hard
to keep these mindless organics enslaved.

177
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,430
And if you want to order someone around,
get your own organics.

178
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
Oh, yeah!

179
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,860
And just how is an astromech unit
going to make our loyal subjects rebel?

180
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,540
Uh-oh.

181
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,170
Oh, my!

182
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,260
Oi, get them!

183
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,170
Uh-oh, again!

184
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,510
Artoo!

185
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,180
It's time to leave
but we still need to recharge.

186
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,350
Here they come! They're coming for us.

187
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,560
We're done for!

188
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,450
They're gonna kill us!

189
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,020
Run for it!

190
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,710
It's all your fault, Artoo, all your fault.

191
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,710
Whatever will we do now?

192
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,800
Artoo, I'm talking to you.

193
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,930
Please don't mumble.

194
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:05,940
Artoo, you're almost out of power.

195
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,440
Here, rest.

196
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,570
Me?

197
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,660
I have 1.723% left in my power core.

198
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,080
I thought for sure you would have
figured something out by now.

199
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,250
You're usually so good
at that sort of thing.

200
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,750
Oh, Artoo, don't leave me, please.

201
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,380
Rest, my friend.

202
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:37,690
I will be joining you soon.

203
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,330
That Republic Y-wing
is a great prize.

204
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,120
Do you think
there are any Jedi around?

205
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,460
Don't worry.

206
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,210
We be takin' off
before anyone realizes we've landed.

207
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,500
What have we here?

208
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:16,550
Looks like two droids
that ran out of power.

209
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:20,060
Lookie, lookie here.

210
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,680
Come to papa.

211
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,020
There you go.

212
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,020
This should be a fun one.

213
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,160
Who would rescue us? Master Anakin?

214
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,460
Artoo, you're recharged.

215
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,670
I'm recharged!

216
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,830
We survived.

217
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:52,290
Where are we?

218
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,340
Pirates?

219
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Oh, my.

220
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,360
What are they cheering for?

221
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,200
Oh, goodness gracious me!

222
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,740
Soon it will be us.

223
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,210
Oh, my stars!

224
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
Oh, no!

225
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,140
General, we've come across
what appears to be a pirate ship.

226
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,150
Use that ship for target
practice. Open fire!

227
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,070
All forward cannons open fire.
Battle stations!

228
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,990
Oh, my!

229
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,830
Go get him, Artoo.

230
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,890
Oh, no, we'll never get back to the ship!

231
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,030
We surrender.

232
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,200
We surrender!

233
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,860
Uh, where did you come from?

234
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,950
They must be pirate droids.

235
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,790
Pirate droids!

236
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,830
You're under arrest.

237
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,250
Pirate droids? We're not pirate droids.

238
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,960
We are part of the Republic.

239
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,960
Oh, yes, we are pirate droids.

240
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,000
That is what we thought.

241
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,090
Send them off to the incinerator room
with the rest of the pirate scum.

242
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,180
The incinerator room?

243
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,470
Yes. You will be melted down
for General Grievous' war machine.

244
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,060
This is terrible.

245
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,320
No! No!

246
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,570
Oh, this trip has been nothing but
calamity all the way.

247
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,410
Thanks for the rescue, Master Plo.

248
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,200
General Grievous has fled.

249
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,290
Very good! Finish off the remaining droids.

250
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,760
We're Republic.

251
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,500
We belong to Senator Amidala.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot!

252
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
I can't believe it.

253
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,380
You know these droids,
Commander Wolffe?

254
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,430
Yes, sir.

255
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,590
We transported them
to Master Gallia's ship

256
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,220
after we left the planet Aleen.

257
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,520
Yes, Commander Wolffe.
How have you been, sir?

258
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,850
We have been on quite an adventure.

259
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,400
Well, I'm certain
Wolffe would love to hear about it.

260
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,150
Uh, actually, sir...

261
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:47,400
- Excellent! It's a long story.
- Uh...

262
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,860
- And you won't believe it.
- Sir, excuse me...

263
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,870
I hardly believe it myself.

264
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,750
It all started when...
