1
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,410
<i>Piracy in deep space!</i>

2
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:24,030
<i>Infamous outlaw Hondo Ohnaka
attacks a Jedi transport</i>

3
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,330
<i>carrying six younglings</i>

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,170
<i>who just received
their lightsaber crystals.</i>

5
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,120
<i>So rare are these crystals</i>

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,096
<i>that Hondo knows he can sell
them on the black market</i>

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,770
<i>for a small fortune.</i>

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,340
<i>In a desperate attempt
to save the younglings,</i>

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:41,400
<i>Ahsoka Tano is captured
by Hondo and his pirate horde.</i>

10
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,970
<i>Now, with a damaged ship,</i>

11
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,000
<i>the younglings are stranded and alone.</i>

12
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,140
This is the <i>Crucible</i>

13
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,070
calling the Republic fleet.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,510
Come in please.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,040
We need help.

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,410
<i>This is General Kenobi.</i>

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,750
<i>We have your transmission.</i>

18
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,350
The General Kenobi?

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,190
The pirate Hondo has attacked
and severely damaged our ship

20
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,920
and taken our chaperone, Ahsoka Tano.

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,690
I'm dispatching Commander Cody
to bring you back.

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,590
We shall deal with Hondo on Florrum.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,260
<i>Will Ahsoka be all right?</i>

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,730
Hondo would be even more
of a fool than I think he is

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,330
to hurt her.

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,070
Once we've picked you up
we'll focus on rescuing Ahsoka.

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,930
But we could help Ahsoka
a lot sooner than you can.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,300
<i>You've shown great bravery,
but these pirates...</i>

29
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,200
It was us who managed
to drive them from the ship.

30
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,940
You will not jeopardize your safety

31
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:37,610
trying to be heroes, understood?

32
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,380
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,710
Their coordinates put them
dangerously close to Florrum.

34
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,680
I do not want them getting any ideas.

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,196
You will need to leave quickly, Cody.

36
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,750
Sir, enemy fleets
coming out of hyperspace.

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,410
Battle stations.

38
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,030
Launch all fighters.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,660
Cody, looks like
you're staying here for now.

40
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,640
Heh, what do you think?

41
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,860
I think you've finished
your lightsaber.

42
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,570
Doesn't mean you know how to use it.

43
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,230
Well, if you hurry up with yours,

44
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,970
maybe we could find out.

45
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,140
I'll finish mine when I'm ready.

46
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,180
Seeing as how our rescue party
has forgotten us,

47
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,980
you'll have plenty of time.

48
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,520
They probably just got delayed.

49
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,790
Delayed?

50
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,820
Ahsoka needs our help,
and we're sitting around

51
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:06,920
like children.

52
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,120
We are children.

53
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,630
I vote we mount a rescue mission.

54
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,900
Gungi is with me.

55
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,970
Byph?

56
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,830
That's three votes for and...

57
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,540
One against.

58
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,940
Perfect timing.

59
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,540
There's a problem with the ship.

60
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,410
What kind of problem?

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,280
Breaking away from the pirate ship

62
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,520
ruptured the entire filtering system.

63
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,050
What does that mean?

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,290
It means she's venting coolant,

65
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,950
and if we don't land soon,
the engines will explode.

66
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,420
We'll have to land
and let the system reset.

67
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,520
Then it's settled.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,320
If we stay out here we'll die.

69
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,720
We go to Florrum,
let the engines cool,

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,460
and rescue Ahsoka.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,110
A rescue mission?

72
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,250
It would be wise
if you would let me go.

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,550
No, it would be unprofitable
if I would let you go,

74
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,660
and why would I do something
as shortsighted as that?

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,760
If you don't let me go,

76
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,470
you will wish you had been born
a protocol droid.

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Sometimes I do anyway.

78
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,330
But you are really in no position

79
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,900
to make threats, young lady.

80
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,600
You look stressed.

81
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,740
Are you thirsty?

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,500
A drink, perhaps?

83
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,710
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

84
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,850
Sorry, but I do not like to share.

85
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,280
Our forces are being overrun.

86
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,190
The droids are sending out
boarding parties.

87
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,150
We must get to the main hangar
to repel them.

88
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,020
We're being overrun!

89
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,590
Push forward!

90
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,610
Kenobi.

91
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,350
You'll regret that.

92
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,990
Florrum.

93
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,180
Guess we're in the right place.

94
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,750
R2, finish reassembling
Master Huyang, will you?

95
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,290
I hate to see him like this.

96
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,190
Ganodi, you stay with the ship.

97
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,570
And who put you in charge?

98
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,520
We're going to need
to make a quick escape,

99
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,836
and you're the only one that had
flight simulator training

100
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,930
at the temple.

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Oh, seeing as you put it like that.

102
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,120
I don't see anything.

103
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,790
There's no one.

104
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,360
Are we sure
we even landed near their base?

105
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,440
Well, we couldn't land
too close, could we?

106
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,940
My scanner's indicating
a strong power source.

107
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,200
Uh, that way.

108
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,280
It must be their base.

109
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,370
You have no idea
how we're going to get inside

110
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,630
and find Ahsoka, do you?

111
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,370
I'm working on it.

112
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,840
Byph is right.
We better get moving.

113
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,540
We'll figure out a strategy
on the way.

114
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,820
You know the Republic
won't pay a ransom for me,

115
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,690
and the Separatists can't be trusted.

116
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,890
They'll betray you and kill us both.

117
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,030
Yes, I know this, my dear.

118
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:38,300
The Separatists
are no friends of mine.

119
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,630
Don't ask me why,
but Dooku holds such a grudge

120
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,470
against me since our little
"I held him hostage" affair.

121
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,600
Pah!

122
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,970
The truth is, I have my sights set

123
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,870
on more nefarious criminals than I,

124
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,710
a businessman who will pay
handsomely for a Jedi.

125
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,610
A female Jedi at that.

126
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,780
You don't scare me, Hondo.

127
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,950
Ooh!

128
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,180
Oh, by the way.

129
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,950
They don't care
if you're dead or alive.

130
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,290
I mean, I prefer alive.

131
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,330
Less messy.

132
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,060
But I find my moods
so changeable these days.

133
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,300
Ooh!

134
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,600
General, the fuel barrel!

135
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,940
Right.

136
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,870
Fall back.

137
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,070
Fall back!

138
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,140
This is General Kenobi.

139
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,480
Abandon ship. Abandon ship!

140
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,280
Sir, shouldn't we stay and fight?

141
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,680
We can't lose the ship now.

142
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,480
Cody, the ship is already lost.

143
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:51,950
We must face it.

144
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,520
But you and I are going to give
Grievous a little parting gift.

145
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,670
A ship? What kind?

146
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,240
The side of the ship says,

147
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,710
"Preigo's Traveling
World of Wonder".

148
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,250
They're a traveling carnival act.

149
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,480
Faster, you lazy creatures.
Faster!

150
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,980
Oh, Hondo will be furious
if we're late.

151
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,680
You hear me?

152
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,460
Hey, hey, and now what?

153
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,460
You there, what the...
what are you doing?

154
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,170
I said faster, not stop.

155
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,940
Sir.

156
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,196
Are we to understand
you were on your way

157
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,180
to the pirate stronghold?

158
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,370
Yes, what's it to you?

159
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,310
Who are you?
How did you get out here?

160
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,110
Sir, our ship crashed
and we've been stranded,

161
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:19,080
but our misfortune is to your benefit.

162
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,450
Oh, really?

163
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,620
And, uh, how is that,
my curious friend?

164
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,900
We are...

165
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,570
acrobats!

166
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,520
Entertainers.

167
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,890
We would love to join your act

168
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,490
and travel with you
to your next destination.

169
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,800
Really?

170
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,000
All of you wish to join my act, huh?

171
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,530
Right.

172
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,300
You would like to come with us
when we go to entertain Hondo

173
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,440
and his pirate horde?

174
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,140
Very much so, yes.

175
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:52,410
Oh, no, no, I... I'm sorry.

176
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,280
The pirates are an unforgiving
audience.

177
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,820
I couldn't possibly...

178
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,950
What...

179
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,420
How did you...

180
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,720
Oh, my, my.

181
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,390
Artists, true artists!

182
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,150
Young man, how many
of these tricks can you do?

183
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,360
How many do you want?

184
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,990
Ho, ho, ho, ho, welcome to the show!

185
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,650
General, we have secured the ship.

186
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,687
Excellent.

187
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,080
Waste no time,

188
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,210
and get me every last piece
of information

189
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,980
from the data banks.

190
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,380
<i>General Grievous, you have defeated me</i>

191
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:50,490
<i>and taken control of my ship.</i>

192
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,350
<i>Congratulations.</i>

193
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,820
<i>However, if you're watching
this message,</i>

194
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,390
<i>that means I'm boarding an escape pod</i>

195
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,390
<i>and shall soon be safely away
from the ship</i>

196
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,690
<i>which is about to self-destruct.</i>

197
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,500
<i>General Grievous,
you have defeated me...</i>

198
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,570
Sir.

199
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,710
Ah!

200
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,290
Wah!

201
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,310
Wait, wait!

202
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,520
What are you doing?

203
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,650
Uh-oh.

204
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,720
Uh-oh.

205
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,900
I'm afraid the younglings
are now on their own.

206
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,220
Preigo.

207
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
You'd better know
what you're doing because

208
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,730
I don't see Ahsoka.

209
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
Patience.

210
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,600
I, Preigo, your humble servant,

211
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,870
have searched far and wide,

212
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,140
oh, illustrious plunderer
of the universe,

213
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,280
and found you
a most special entertainment.

214
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,440
Good.

215
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:51,180
I would hate to be forced
to cut off their heads

216
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,410
like I did to your last act.

217
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,410
You remember those guys.

218
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,060
You are a brave man
to come before me again.

219
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Look.

220
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,590
He has Ahsoka's lightsabers.

221
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
I'll get them.

222
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,560
Where is my Jedi?

223
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,990
I would hate for her to miss the show

224
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:16,500
which I'm hoping
will be better than last time.

225
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,200
Excellent.

226
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,040
Let the show begin!

227
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,670
Ah, yes, of course.

228
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:28,410
May I present
the, uh, Animal Instincts.

229
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,310
Oh, no.

230
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,150
I love a kiddie act.

231
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,140
What is this business?

232
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,910
I believe he wants you to, uh,
be a part of the next stunt.

233
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:18,880
Oh, does he now?

234
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,080
Come with us.

235
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,580
Which one of you said that?

236
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,490
I may not be as young as I once was,

237
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,450
but I'm older!

238
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,190
Stand right here.

239
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Who wants to see Hondo's moves?

240
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,960
Talk to me, hey!

241
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,390
You guys shouldn't be here.

242
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:15,790
Don't worry. We have a plan.

243
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,790
I think.

244
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,860
I am flying!

245
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,030
Ah!

246
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
What the...

247
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

248
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,470
Not again.

249
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,270
Oh!

250
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,870
Ah.

251
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,040
Well, that was a good act.

252
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,890
It's those bleeding Jedi kids.

253
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,950
What?

254
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,080
The children are Jedi?

255
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,150
Oh!

256
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,760
Get to those speeders.

257
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,760
We've got to run for it!

258
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,930
Those blasted kids
have screwed everything up!

259
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,830
Hondo's going to kill us.

260
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,840
Quick, get to that speeder.

261
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,580
Get us out of here!

262
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,220
What is going on?

263
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,330
Where is my Jedi?

264
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,030
Someone stop them!

265
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,410
Hurry, Gwarm, get after them!

266
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,500
Ah.

267
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,170
I know how you feel.

268
00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,670
You lost your master,
and I lost my Jedi.

269
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,770
Ugh.

270
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,150
How do you feel?

271
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,450
Better now.

272
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,320
I could pretend to be angry,
but you were all very brave.

273
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,860
Thank you.

274
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,690
We disobeyed orders.

275
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,870
Well, I've learned from my Master

276
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,360
that sometimes doing the right thing

277
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,500
means bending the rules.

278
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,630
Ganodi, come in please.

279
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,870
Get the ship ready.

280
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,930
We need to take off.
