1
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,505
How are we gonna get out of here?

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,927
I have an idea.

3
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:58,599
Which is?

4
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,519
Just set those things to stun.
We're not trying to kill anyone.

5
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,307
Yeah, well, tell that to them.

6
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,691
They're almost through.

7
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,234
Wait.

8
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:11,987
Wait.

9
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:14,365
Now!

10
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,722
R7, find us a path out of here.

11
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,239
All right. Now what?

12
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,490
The escape pods have been destroyed.
Taking a shuttle is our best bet.

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,589
The boys are having
a rough time of it.

14
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,789
Did you hear Maul also escaped?

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,250
He didn't escape. I let him out.

16
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,381
What? Why?

17
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,052
Diversion. Come on!

18
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,381
That's one word for it.

19
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,737
<i>Target number
one's escaped the medical bay.</i>

20
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,761
<i>We're in pursuit.</i>

21
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,809
<i>What is the status of CT-7567?</i>

22
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,664
<i>Commander Rex
is still missing in action, sir.</i>

23
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,227
<i>Did he aid in Tano's escape?</i>

24
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,747
<i>Unknown at present.</i>

25
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,342
Target number two
is in the hyperdrive room!

26
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,237
Sir, the hyperdrive generators
are failing!

27
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,832
Disengage! Disengage!

28
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,952
It's too late!

29
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,542
Oh, I don't like the sound of that.

30
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,455
Hangar bay doors are sealed.
They've got everything locked down.

31
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,217
If they weren't trying to kill us,
I'd be proud.

32
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,429
R7, start unlocking the doors on bay 12.

33
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,559
Cheep, prep the shuttle.

34
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,519
G-G, find out what happened to the ship.

35
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,353
- Watch it!
- Look out!

36
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,382
<i>Control failed to report in.</i>

37
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,946
<i>We think they'll make their move
to escape via the main hangar.</i>

38
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,832
<i>Affirmative, I want
squads marshaled at position 2-5 and 2-7.</i>

39
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,832
<i>Wait for my signal before proceeding.</i>

40
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,017
<i>Copy that, Lieutenant.</i>

41
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,504
What do you mean
the hyperdrive is off-line?

42
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,763
Destroyed? It's completely gone?

43
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,639
We're caught
in that moon's gravitational field.

44
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,690
R7, open the main hangar doors.

45
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,507
We need to get out of here.

46
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,089
Any luck with those doors?

47
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,989
And the shuttle?

48
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:14,873
There it is.

49
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,917
- Go!
- I can see them there!

50
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,006
Go, go, go!

51
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,799
They were waiting for us.

52
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,686
Hold your position, men.

53
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,782
If they try to leave,
they'll have to go through us.

54
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,783
So what do we do?
Fight our way to the shuttle?

55
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,451
They're too many.

56
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,452
Besides, I don't wanna hurt them.

57
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,210
I hate to tell you this,
but they don't care.

58
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,128
This ship is going down,
and those soldiers, my brothers,

59
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,301
are willing to die and take you and me
along with them.

60
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,414
You're a good soldier, Rex.

61
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,949
So is every one of those men down there.

62
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:35,905
They may be willing to die, but I am not
the one who is going to kill them.

63
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,049
So, we're just gonna surrender?

64
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,551
Admit defeat? Is that it?

65
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,564
No.

66
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,018
Well, I don't see any other option.

67
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,239
I have an idea.

68
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,503
Don't worry. It's a good one... I think.

69
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,328
Can I count on the three of you?

70
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,418
Good. I'll explain on the way.

71
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,243
<i>Sir, we think
Maul might be headed your way. Be aware.</i>

72
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,557
Hold your fire!

73
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,876
Hang on.
We have Tano and the commander.

74
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,740
Send all remaining troops to my position.

75
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,825
I said hold your fire, Jesse.
I have the situation under control.

76
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,999
You have your order, sir.
Now execute it or I will!

77
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,673
The order was to execute the Jedi
for treason against the Republic.

78
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:09,473
The problem is,
Ahsoka Tano is no longer a Jedi.

79
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,879
Hasn't been for some time.

80
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:22,443
Sir, you said yourself we're under
special order from Darth Sidious

81
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:28,110
to eliminate Ahsoka Tano
and any other clone who disobeys Order 66.

82
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,534
Just keep him talking,
a little bit longer.

83
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:36,699
Jesse. Jesse, listen to me.

84
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:38,445
We've known each other a long time.

85
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:43,456
If we don't get this right, we will be
the ones committing treason, not her.

86
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,045
Commander Rex,
you're in violation of Order 66.

87
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,392
I accuse you of treason
against the Grand Army of the Republic.

88
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,389
You'll be demoted in rank from commander
and subject to execution

89
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,563
along with the traitor Ahsoka Tano.

90
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,728
Ready?

91
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,574
Yeah, I didn't much like
being a commander anyway.

92
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,110
Company, ready. Aim!

93
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,195
Now!

94
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,968
Rex, the ship.

95
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,534
You wanted this chaos.

96
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,926
Move it. Move it.

97
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,314
Get these lifts activated.
Get us up there.

98
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,952
Our panel's locked out.

99
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,599
Fire on those droids.

100
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:47,331
The shuttle.

101
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,940
Incoming.

102
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,978
Surround them!

103
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,418
Can't hold them off.
Too many of them.

104
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,269
Blast them.

105
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,612
Hey.

106
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,040
Blast those dirty droids.

107
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,723
Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

108
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,901
Everything down here is under maintenance.

109
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:12,685
There!

110
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,397
Get me over there.

111
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,809
We've entered the atmosphere.
Fire retro-rockets.

112
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,225
We've lost lateral control.
We're gonna break apart...

113
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,446
Look out!

114
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,082
Come on.
