1
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,530
Blinded by the dark side!

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,370
The Jedi Council
has begun to unravel the mystery

3
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,970
of how the clone army was created.

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,130
And now fear the Sith Lord,
Count Dooku was behind it.

5
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,380
Master Yoda searches for answers.

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,210
And during deep meditation,

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,680
he is able to contact
the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn,

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,970
who reveals to Yoda that he must
manifest his consciousness after death

9
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,020
if he is to preserve the Jedi Order.

10
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,060
Now, we find Master Yoda
deep in space

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,860
searching for a path to
ones who will teach him

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,070
all he does not know of the Force.

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,870
The place Qui-Gon spoke of
I believe this is.

14
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,080
So, blocking our scanners the gas is.

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,170
But inside a planet may be. Hmm.

16
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,670
Sense it I do.

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,280
Controlling this are you?

18
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,910
Let the Force guide I will.

19
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,640
Hmm, awake again you are,
my little friend.

20
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,800
Where we are I'm not sure.

21
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:46,720
But strong with the Force this place is.

22
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,270
There you see?

23
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,740
From inside the planet life emanates.

24
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,660
Here, nothing your scanners can see?
Hmm?

25
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,160
Need this, I will not.

26
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,630
No, wait here you must.
A journey for me alone this is.

27
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:27,140
Safer here you are, my friend.

28
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,490
Yoda.

29
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,660
Who is there?

30
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:30,780
Yoda.

31
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,790
Traveled far I have,
looking for those who can teach me.

32
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,170
The question is,
are you worthy of being taught?

33
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,850
You are late.

34
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:58,600
We have been
waiting for you, Master Yoda.

35
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,110
Late? How did you know coming I was?

36
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,490
We watch and study all who are
strong with the Force in the universe.

37
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,370
Now come, if we are to begin.

38
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,610
Cousins, I have a guest.

39
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,090
You should not
have brought him before us!

40
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,580
Nonsense, he is
full of the Force. Can you not feel it?

41
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,000
Why is he here?

42
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:03,340
Why are you here?

43
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:07,130
Told I was to learn to from you.

44
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,760
That show me you could
how to manifest my life after death.

45
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,560
That's impossible!
He will fail the great gift.

46
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,980
He will disappoint us.
He will disappoint himself.

47
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,150
No. No, I do not see that.

48
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,190
His destiny is
already set. It is not for us to decide.

49
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,920
But why him?

50
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,280
He is to
teach one that will save

51
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,700
the universe from a great imbalance.

52
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,580
For this, the great gift will be his.

53
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,210
He has no idea
what he seeks!

54
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:46,210
The responsibility he will have!

55
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,050
Understand I do not.

56
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,340
Guide me I know you will.

57
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,010
And do you
realize what you must do?

58
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,680
What you must face?

59
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,070
No.

60
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,390
Good. Then you won't be afraid.

61
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,080
Do I have
our blessing that the training can begin?

62
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,450
It is so.
We are one and one is all.

63
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,080
Do you come to
us with only good intention

64
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,960
and light in your heart?

65
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,550
I do. Yes.

66
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,300
Then the blessing I give,
and the training will begin.

67
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,650
Disappoint us not, little green one.

68
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,360
What is this place?

69
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:59,030
All that
surrounds us is the foundation of life.

70
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,330
The birthplace of what your science
calls "midi-chlorians."

71
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:08,430
The foundation of what connects
the living Force and the cosmic Force.

72
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,710
When a living thing dies, all is renewed.

73
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,680
Life passes from the living Force
into the cosmic Force

74
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,600
and becomes one with it.

75
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,430
One powers the other.

76
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,480
One is renewed by the other.

77
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,690
This I know.

78
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,660
Come with me.

79
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,120
At death, in order for you to preserve
your identity,

80
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:46,290
you must know yourself, your true self,
and then let go.

81
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,550
On that island dwells
all that remains unconquered,

82
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,340
what in your existence some call evil,

83
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,300
otherwise known as fear.

84
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,100
All which must be finally overcome
before the journey can be taken.

85
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,270
Free yourself you must.

86
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,900
A Jedi Master I am.

87
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,650
Know all that dwells within I do.

88
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,740
Mastered my weaknesses
and conquered my fears I have.

89
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,820
Have you?

90
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,580
You must face your evil on that island
and defeat it.

91
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,820
Yoda.

92
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,680
Yoda.

93
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,930
Yoda.

94
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,680
Show yourself.

95
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,610
Yoda hates me, yes?

96
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:46,530
Yoda plays not with me anymore!

97
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,750
Yoda thinks me not worthy.

98
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,680
Yoda recognizes you not!

99
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,680
See not
what is inside Yoda?

100
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,020
I choose not to give you power.

101
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,360
And yet you spend
your days in the decadence of war.

102
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,940
And with that, I grow inside you.

103
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,530
Know your true self.

104
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,990
Face me now, or I will devour you.

105
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,350
Part of me you are not!

106
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:56,730
Part of you I am.
Part of all that lives.

107
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,490
Why do you hate
what gives you power?

108
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:22,510
Yoda thinks me not worthy.

109
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,010
Recognize you I do.

110
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
Huh?

111
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,690
Part of me you are, yes.

112
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,110
But power over me you have not.

113
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,530
Through patience and training,
it is I who control you.

114
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,210
Control over me you have not.

115
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,630
My dark side you are.
Reject you I do.

116
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,660
You have
conquered your hubris.

117
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,990
Now face the temptations you must.

118
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,960
Powerful the creature was.

119
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,340
What you faced was a reflection of

120
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,710
your hubris and
the shadow of your soul.

121
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,260
And yet, clear I thought I was.

122
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,560
The beast is you
and you are the beast.

123
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,230
To deny it simply gives it power.

124
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:01,190
Now I see.
Simple the answer was.

125
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:08,110
Deep in your core you felt that
we had nothing to teach you.

126
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,570
But you must trust in our teachings
if you are to succeed.

127
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,120
Ready I am for what comes next.

128
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,290
You must enter the valley of extinction.

129
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,930
Pass through without emotion,
without attachment.

130
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:36,260
For you will see all our faces there
and they will seduce you.

131
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,890
For we are Confusion.

132
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,890
Anger.

133
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,480
Sadness.

134
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,060
Joy.

135
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,940
And Serenity.

136
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,250
Stop! Stop!

137
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,750
- No! No! No!

138
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,450
Master Yoda. Please, help me.

139
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm dying.

140
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,250
What has happened here, Padawan?

141
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,000
- Who has done this?

142
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,550
The Sith.

143
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,380
How?

144
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,800
You told me I would finish my training
and become a Jedi,

145
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:59,260
but the council expelled me.

146
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,600
Why would you do that?

147
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,150
Will I still become one with the Force
when I die?

148
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:12,820
Master, will I be a Jedi?

149
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,070
Padawan? Padawan. Ahsoka.

150
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,530
No! No! No!

151
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,330
Not strong enough I was. No!

152
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,330
Failed I have. Failed them all.

153
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,710
Master Yoda.

154
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:34,630
Let me take you away
from your confusion,

155
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,220
your anger, your sadness!

156
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,860
Come with me
and you will never know pain.

157
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,700
Never know sadness.

158
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,940
Close your eyes,
and I will guide you.

159
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,540
The temple is beautiful,
isn't it, Master Yoda?

160
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,640
Yes, so peaceful,
as it was before the war.

161
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,560
War? Oh, there is no war here, Master.

162
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,520
Only peace and tranquility.

163
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,400
No war?

164
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,950
Ah, Master Yoda.

165
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,920
Master Dooku was just telling us
a tale of when he was your Padawan.

166
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,170
Really quite a humorous story.

167
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,880
Count Dooku!

168
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,920
Yes, Master.

169
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:01,300
I was telling them the tale of when you
faced the giant terentatek on Kashyyyk.

170
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,180
What a terrible beast it was.

171
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,310
Yes, yes.

172
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,190
I remember.

173
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:13,060
We had wonderful adventures,
Master Yoda and I.

174
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:16,650
I'm sure we'd all love to hear more,
but it's time to join the others.

175
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:22,670
Coming, Master?

176
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,510
No, wrong this is.

177
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,800
Lies, these images are!

178
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,470
Lies!

179
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,900
Dead, I know you to be!

180
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,810
On Naboo, died you did, Qui-Gon.

181
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,190
And a traitor you are,
my old Padawan.

182
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,250
No! An illusion this is!
A falsehood!

183
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,770
You have done well.

184
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,400
But to succeed,

185
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,690
your life must be
spent learning, practicing.

186
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,950
Please. Show me who you are.

187
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,450
See your face I must.

188
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,130
Nowyou see.

189
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,220
We have achieved what you seek,
and live between the realms.

190
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,130
Dead you are?

191
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,470
Yes.

192
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,560
How shall I complete my training?

193
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,560
You must face the ultimate test.

194
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,480
The ultimate seduction.

195
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,770
The gravest ofjourneys.

196
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,980
You will travel to Moraband...

197
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,370
Moraband?

198
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,410
Journey through
the ancient homeworld of the Sith.

199
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,910
Face all that you fear.

200
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:32,540
All that haunts your soul!

201
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,060
- Hello, my friend.

202
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,020
No, no.
One more place to visit we have.

203
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,790
A strange place I have come from,
but finished not what I came for.

204
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,040
Set a course for Moraband.

205
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,630
Yes, brave we must be.

206
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,300
The worst, I fear, is yet to come.
