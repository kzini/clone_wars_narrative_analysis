1
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,230
<i>War in the Inner Rim!</i>

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,830
<i>Rebel leader Steela Gerrera
has joined forces</i>

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>with General Tandin
after boldly rescuing.</i>

4
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:29,000
<i>Onderon's former king from execution,</i>

5
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,040
<i>evading a trap set
by Separatist ally King Rash</i>

6
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:34,110
<i>and the droid general Kalani.</i>

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>Amid growing public support
and rising unrest,</i>

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,580
<i>Ahsoka continues to monitor
the rebels' efforts</i>

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,750
<i>as they rally around Ramsis Dendup</i>

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,630
<i>to restore his reign
as the rightful king</i>

11
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,120
<i>and finally put an end</i>

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,520
<i>to the Separatist occupation
of Onderon.</i>

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,310
I'm picking up
an electromagnetic field.

14
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,620
Roger, roger.
It's coming from there.

15
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,380
Whoa!

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,090
<i>My fellow subjects,
I appear not as your king</i>

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,890
<i>but as a servant of Onderon.</i>

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,930
<i>We are in the midst
of a great struggle.</i>

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,800
<i>The Confederacy has used
the recent attacks</i>

20
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,840
<i>as an opportunity to tighten
their hold on Onderon.</i>

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,580
<i>They have accused me of leading
these so-called terrorists.</i>

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,410
<i>It is a lie they have engineered</i>

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,150
<i>to further restrict your independence</i>

24
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,820
<i>and use deadly force
against our people.</i>

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,620
<i>The truth is, I have never
met them before now.</i>

26
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,030
<i>I have come to know them
as the true sons of Onderon.</i>

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,160
<i>They are unwilling
to surrender our freedom</i>

28
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,770
<i>to those who conspire
to take it from us.</i>

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,540
<i>Our destiny is tied to them
and this planet.</i>

30
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,110
<i>We must all rise together
to protect it.</i>

31
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,580
Uh-oh.

32
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,020
Why are they looking at us that way?

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,290
Hey!

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,190
What the? Blast them!

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,630
Ahh!

36
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,000
Uh-oh.

37
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,560
The people are
turning against the droids.

38
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,230
There's rioting in the streets now.

39
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,560
That's a beautiful thing.

40
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:06,300
We need to keep the battle
to the outskirts of the city.

41
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,540
Less structures and people.

42
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,940
But less clankers.
Their main force is in Iziz.

43
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,510
We should join the fight down there

44
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,450
and take it straight to King Rash.

45
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,480
We all want victory, but not
at the cost of innocent lives.

46
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,250
If we fight door to door,
no one is safe.

47
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,580
This is war, Steela.

48
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,850
She's right.

49
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,320
I agree.

50
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,760
The more you draw the droids
from the city to the highlands,

51
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:32,000
the safer the people will be.

52
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,330
My men await your command, my Lord.

53
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,200
I believe there is a new contender.

54
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,770
<i>You will lead our forces,
including the Royal Army.</i>

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,070
Steela is now the commanding general.

56
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,180
A great choice.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,380
As you wish, my Lord.

58
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,380
You and your rebels
renewed my faith in myself.

59
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,690
Now I'm putting my faith in you.

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,860
Let's ride.

62
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,780
Just in case.

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,340
We are losing the public.

64
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:54,110
If they turn against us,
I fear the outcome.

65
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,950
Fear will bring them back.

66
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,350
We must eliminate Dendup,
General Tandin,

67
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,590
and the terrorists

68
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,220
before the people
commit to their efforts.

69
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,320
General Tandin is weak.

70
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,290
His army will not withstand
the power of the Confederacy.

71
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,930
Neither will the terrorists.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,530
General, our scouts have
located the main rebel forces

73
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,300
in the mountains to the east.

74
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,670
With the rioting in the city,
how can we spare the troops

75
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,710
to attack the rebels in the mountains?

76
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,850
Do not underestimate our means.

77
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,650
If the rebel army falls,

78
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,880
the citizens will lose their courage,

79
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,250
and order will be restored.

80
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,130
Your target lies
in the mountains to the east.

81
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,730
The army will follow.

82
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,770
Leave no survivors. Go.

83
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,300
By your command.

84
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,230
The droid army is almost here.

85
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:12,300
Everyone, get ready.

86
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Ready.

87
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,890
Saw, begin your attack.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yah!

89
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,220
Ahh!

90
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,290
No!

91
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,850
Where did that come from?

92
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
There.

93
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,990
Any ideas?

94
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,560
Yeah. Run!

95
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Ahh!

96
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,150
<i>I take it the rebels
have Dooku's full attention.</i>

97
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,680
It's a full-scale war.

98
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,080
They need our help.

99
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,820
Please talk to the Council.

100
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,760
<i>Even Master Windu
would be wary at this point.</i>

101
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,530
<i>The Council will not
engage or involve the Republic</i>

102
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,130
<i>in an internal affair.</i>

103
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,740
The Separatists have a new gunship

104
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,230
with a powerful ray shield.

105
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,000
Nothing's getting past it.

106
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,580
<i>I am sorry, Ahsoka.</i>

107
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,500
<i>They will have to find a way.</i>

108
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,400
<i>Do not stay there
if their failure is certain.</i>

109
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,940
<i>Evacuate who you can and return
to Coruscant immediately.</i>

110
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,240
<i>Do you understand?</i>

111
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,140
<i>Yes, Master.</i>

112
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,780
We need to help them.

113
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:11,120
We will do what we can
to relocate the survivors.

114
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,050
Before they lose their planet.

115
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,990
We can't.

116
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,390
What difference does it make now?

117
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,030
The Separatists know we're involved.

118
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,260
I don't disagree with you, Anakin,

119
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,130
but to send in Republic gunships
defeats our purpose.

120
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,830
We must stay true to our intentions,

121
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
learn our lessons.

122
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,870
It doesn't have to look like
we're the ones helping.

123
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,240
What if another party was involved?

124
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,680
Another party?

125
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,450
Who in the galaxy
would be running around

126
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,480
with an extra batch of missiles?

127
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,950
Hondo.

128
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,310
Is the Republic going to help us?

129
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,930
No.

130
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,100
What's it going to take?

131
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,840
King Rash rules Onderon.

132
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,240
Unless that changes,
the Republic can't do anything.

133
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,310
They're pulling back.
Cover them.

134
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,230
At this rate, the clankers

135
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,770
aren't going to need reinforcements.

136
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,830
We have to regroup at the nest.

137
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,260
Yah!

138
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,460
Skywalker, my old friend.

139
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,270
You come alone?

140
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,670
For your service.

141
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,850
Oh, business!

142
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,410
Good, good, good.
That I understand.

143
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,920
I need you to make a delivery for me.

144
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:17,150
And that all I am to you, Jedi?

145
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,160
A delivery boy?

146
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,020
I know that if I need arms
shipped illegally,

147
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,890
you're the man I need to go to.

148
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,330
Illegally?

149
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,630
Now, why would a Jedi need
to deliver arms illegally?

150
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,030
How about I pay you well enough

151
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,676
that you just deliver
the missiles for me

152
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,530
and don't ask any questions?

153
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,110
Well, as long as you're not
paying me in credits,

154
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,510
I'm sure I could accommodate
your wishes, Master Jedi.

155
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,920
The highlands may slow down
the droids,

156
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,860
but they won't stop the gunships.

157
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,590
We have to move.

158
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,630
Any word from Master Skywalker?

159
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,170
Not yet.

160
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,400
We're not giving up yet.

161
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,300
Stagger our defenses to the camp.

162
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,470
Secure the approach.
Stay in small teams.

163
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,910
Make use of our training.

164
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,710
You really are
the best leader among us.

165
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,080
Couldn't be more proud
of you, my sister.

166
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,420
I learned from the best, big brother.

167
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,450
Let's go, General.

168
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,850
You have to help us.

169
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,160
I'll do all I can to protect you,

170
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,670
but I can't fight this war for you.

171
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,400
We wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

172
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,270
I wish I could do more.

173
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,800
Wait.

174
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,530
Looks like we have company.

175
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,710
Don't shoot!

176
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,060
Well, you could be
my new favorite spice.

177
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,030
Yeah, I don't think so.

178
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,430
Careful, pirate.

179
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,240
Hondo, what are you doing here?

180
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,670
Oh, no, no, no.

181
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,970
You should thank me, child.

182
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,040
I have brought you a gift
from Skywalker and Kenobi.

183
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:24,180
The latest from Sienar.

184
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,450
Rocket launchers?

185
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,850
Shoulder-fired. Very expensive.

186
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,180
Paid for?

187
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,120
Very handsome...

188
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,550
Oh! Oh, my, look at the time.

189
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,090
Well, my work here is done.

190
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,650
Ugh, they must have seen Hondo's ship.

191
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,750
It was only a patrol.

192
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,980
We have to get these
down to the others.

193
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,220
Load them up.

194
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:07,520
I hope they work.

195
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,590
There's only one way to find out.

196
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,386
We've tried everything,

197
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,750
but we're target practice
for those gunships.

198
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,590
Now it's their turn.

199
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,850
Thank the Jedi.

200
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
Saw!

201
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,400
I love this!

202
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,510
Distribute the rocket launchers

203
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,420
and take out those gunships.

204
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,310
Steela, they're attacking the nest.

205
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,410
They're after the king!

206
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,450
Come on!

207
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,150
She sure leads by example.

208
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,460
What good will that do us
if she gets herself killed?

209
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,610
Steela, hurry! Steela, come in!

210
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,657
Ugh!

211
00:15:23,681 --> 00:15:26,440
Where is the false king?

212
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,150
I'll never tell you!

213
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,660
Ugh!

214
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,150
Find the king.

215
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,300
Help has arrived!

216
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,160
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

217
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,360
Thanks to you.

218
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,430
Fire!

219
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,630
Last one's mine.

220
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,370
Get down!

221
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
Look!

222
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,540
Hang... on!

223
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:35,380
Steela!

224
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:39,450
Ah!

225
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,860
I'll handle this.

226
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,660
I got you.

227
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,040
Your gunships have failed.

228
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,310
I need more reinforcements.

229
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,780
<i>Really?</i>

230
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:47,320
<i>General Kalani, what is your
assessment of the situation?</i>

231
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,900
They have managed
to penetrate our shields

232
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,000
and are using the cover
of the highlands

233
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,160
against our forces.

234
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:57,860
To defeat them will take time.

235
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,630
<i>A prolonged war does not
interest me, General.</i>

236
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,940
<i>Their rebellion grows
with every small victory.</i>

237
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,680
Then we are lost.

238
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,780
<i>Salvage the remaining arms
and withdraw the army.</i>

239
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:15,720
<i>Bring them to Agamar.</i>

240
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,756
What about...

241
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Ugh!

242
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,460
It was my fault.

243
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:31,500
I shot that gunship down,

244
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,300
and it crashed into her position.

245
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,400
Saw, it's not your fault.

246
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,500
She knew what the risks were.

247
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:43,740
We all knew what it would take
to free Onderon.

248
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,730
This has been quite a journey
for our Padawan.

249
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:34,860
Steela will be a powerful
spirit in their lives.

250
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,760
Yes.

251
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,500
For all of us.

252
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,840
I'm sorry for your loss.

253
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,180
Thanks, but it's over now.

254
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,250
Let's just leave it at that.

255
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,420
Steela would be glad.

256
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:00,390
Her sacrifice gave Onderon
its freedom.

257
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,520
But at what cost?

258
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,290
It's like you once said.

259
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,590
Many lives get caught

260
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,760
between the Republic
and the Separatists.

261
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,900
I did say that once,
but after watching your heroics

262
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,870
and the selflessness of the Jedi,

263
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:16,440
I do believe the Republic
is the right side to be on.

264
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,110
What do you mean?

265
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,910
Dendup has appointed me
the new Senator of Onderon.

266
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,250
I will follow
in my mother's footsteps,

267
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,830
and I will bring us back
to the Republic.

268
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,490
Remember this day,

269
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,420
the day Onderon became free again.
