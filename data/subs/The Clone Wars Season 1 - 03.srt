1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,235
<i>A deadly weapon unleashed.</i>

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,312
<i>The Separatist battleship</i> Malevolence
<i>advances unopposed</i>

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,515
<i>through Republic space,</i>

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,672
<i>tearing apart any ship
that stands in its path.</i>

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,395
<i>After a daring rescue and narrow escape,</i>

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,870
<i>Anakin Skywalker prepares
a counterattack on the enemy ship</i>

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,636
<i>and its diabolical droid commander,
General Grievous.</i>

8
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,995
This strike force
has been commissioned by the Senate

9
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,469
to hunt down the enemy's new battleship.

10
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,792
As the bulk of our fleets are engaged
on the fr ont lines, we'll be on our own.

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,838
General Skywalker has prepared
our attack strategy.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,069
Thank you, Admiral.

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,879
While our capital ships are vulnerable
to the enemy's attack,

14
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,554
I believe a squad of bombers
can outmaneuver their ion weapon.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,950
Our target will be the bridge
and General Grievous.

16
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,396
The head clanker.
Skywalker s getting pretty ambitious.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,390
Our bombers will attack at high speed
to evade the enemy's ion weapon.

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,756
We'll concentrate our firepower
on the bridge superstructure, here.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,833
We destr oy Grievous,
we can bring the war to a quicker end.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,115
Pilots, prepare your bombers.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,752
Skywalker, this is an aggressive plan.

22
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,272
Are you sure your squadron
can complete this mission?

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,430
Let's ask them. Matchstick!

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,593
- You think our boys can pull it off?
- Yes, sir!

25
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,399
There hasn't been a mission
Shadow Squadr on couldn't complete.

26
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,155
That's right. Minimal casualties,
maximum effectiveness. That's us.

27
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,953
I admire your confidence, pilot.

28
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,952
Even so, minimal casualties
may be enough

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,191
to prevent you
fr om breaking Grievous' defenses.

30
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,352
Master Plo is right.

31
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,989
With Grievous on that ship's bridge,
it's bound to be well protected.

32
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,308
Don't worry, Ahsoka.

33
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,870
We'll destroy that bridge,
and Grievous along with it.

34
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,351
Master Skywalker seems to inspire
great confidence in his men.

35
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,071
He does lead by example.

36
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,118
So much for the Jedi escort.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,750
The last transport is fleeing, General.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,469
Charge the plasma rotors!

39
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,478
They're moving to attack position, sir.
Still setting the coordinates.

40
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,596
Are we clear to make
the jump to hyperspace?

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,356
Fire ion weapon!

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,432
We've lost all power!

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,271
Boy, this is a lot more fun
when they're not shooting back.

44
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,828
I still can't seem to hit anything.

45
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,872
<i>Grievous, those battle droids
are expensive.</i>

46
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,233
<i>The Jedi are never that harsh
with their clones.</i>

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,076
The care these Jedi show for their troops
is a weakness.

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,755
<i>A weakness we shall continue to exploit.</i>

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,832
<i>I have the coordinates for a new target.</i>

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,994
<i>The Republic's secret
Outer Rim medical station.</i>

51
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,870
<i>It is unprotected
and treating over 60,000 wounded clones.</i>

52
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,270
<i>We will do them a favor
and put them out of their misery.</i>

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,032
<i>Once you have destroyed it,</i>

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,715
<i>there will be nowhere for the Jedi
to send their wounded,</i>

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,472
<i>and they will die.</i>

56
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,313
It will be a pleasure, my lord.

57
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,158
<i>I feel very confident leaving the ship
under your command, General</i>

58
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,428
General!

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,349
Target those escape pods!
I have a reputation to uphold.

60
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,755
- Which one's mine?
- You're with me. You'll be my gunner.

61
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,678
Somebody's got to watch my back.

62
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,389
Br oadside could do that.
Besides, you have Artoo.

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,199
But I so enjoy your company, my Padawan.

64
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,670
- Just admit it. You don't like my flying.
- Well, no, I...

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,478
No, it's not that. It's just I...

66
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,629
Skywalker.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,154
The enemy warship has attacked
our convoy of medical transports

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,355
near Ryndellia.

69
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,158
Medical transports?

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,630
Only General Grievous would go
after clones who can't fight back.

71
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,039
The Ryndellia system.

72
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,032
Near Naboo!
Isn't that where our medical base is?

73
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,758
I'll bet that will be his next target.

74
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,153
There are many star clusters in that area.
With a ship that big,

75
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,313
he will be unable to chart a course
that's less than 10 parsecs.

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,715
Looks like we're gonna have
to take a shortcut.

77
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,598
Admiral, warn that station what's coming.

78
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,995
This journey may be treacherous.

79
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,514
If you lose any ships
before you reach the target...

80
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,477
We won't lose anybody.

81
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,592
I will come along and fly fighter escort.

82
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,954
Any help is welcome, Master Plo.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,559
Just try not to fall behind.

84
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,553
I had a feeling you'd be coming along.
Your ship has already been prepped.

85
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,475
Even if we had the transports,

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,473
it is not possible to evacuate
all of our wounded in time.

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,996
<i>You must try: You won't stand a chance
against that battleship.</i>

88
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,510
<i>Nala Se, I only just received word.</i>

89
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,433
<i>I've contacted the Naboo.
They are sending ships to help you.</i>

90
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,069
<i>- And I am on my way, as well.</i>
- Thank you, Master Jedi.

91
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,151
If they reach us in time,

92
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,595
do you really think
they're going to stop that thing?

93
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,432
It is our only hope.

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,678
Launch the fighters.

95
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,156
<i>I hope you know
what you're doing, Anakin.</i>

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,559
Well, if I don't,

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,835
<i>I won't be around to hear
the ''I told you so.''</i>

98
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,239
That's reassuring.

99
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,118
Well, take your shortcut,
and I'll take the long way.

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,192
- But you better be there before I arrive.
<i>- I'll be there, Obi-Wan.</i>

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,195
Shadow Squadron, tighten formation.
Call in.

102
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,589
Shadow 2, standing by.

103
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,949
Shadow 3, standing by.

104
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,389
Shadow 4, standing by.

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,351
I know, Artooie.
This is gonna be a tough one.

106
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,831
Cut the chatter, Ahsoka.

107
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,439
Shadow 11, standing by.

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,953
Shadow 12, standing by.

109
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,352
Fighter escort ready.

110
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,917
This is Admiral Yularen.
You are cleared for hyperspace jump.

111
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,118
<i>- Good hunting, sir.</i>
- Thanks, Admiral.

112
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,032
<i>All right, boys, let's go.</i>

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,678
Broadside, if we make it
through this one, drinks are on me.

114
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,233
I can already taste it.

115
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:41,442
What's taking so long?

116
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:45,364
I want to get there before
too many wounded clones escape.

117
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,724
Sorry, sir.

118
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,370
The navicomputer has had to calculate
a complex course

119
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:53,159
around a large nebula
near the medical station.

120
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:56,442
They told me this ship was fast!

121
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,683
Okay, if we can just manage
to navigate through my shortcut,

122
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,885
we'll be all right.

123
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,840
A nebula can be very unpredictable.
I advise caution.

124
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,003
Don't worry about us, Master Jedi.

125
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,240
We can hold our own.
Right, Shadow Squadron?

126
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,958
Copy that, Shadow 2.

127
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,360
Does anyone care
what the Padawan thinks?

128
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,567
Of course we care, Snips!

129
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,686
But we're still going through that nebula.

130
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,638
Thanks, Artooie.

131
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,879
<i>The evacuation
is proceeding slowly, madam.</i>

132
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,043
We will have to move the patients
in stable condition first.

133
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:04,679
The more critically injured
will have to wait.

134
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,080
<i>What about the bacta tanks?
Many of those men can't be moved at all.</i>

135
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,888
I know, Commander.

136
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,839
Guide the patients that can be moved
onto transports as quickly as you can.

137
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,484
<i>At once, madam.</i>

138
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,084
This soup is thick.
Can you see anything?

139
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,326
Just keep your eyes on my thruster,
Shadow 2.

140
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,440
They'll have to. The scanners are useless.

141
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,202
This is old-fashioned flying.

142
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:36,282
You have to feel your way through
to stay on course.

143
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,486
<i>Skywalker is right, Ahsoka.</i>

144
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,519
Clear your mind, young one,
and you will see the path.

145
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,804
Right now, I can't see anything at all.

146
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,202
<i>I always know
where I'm going.</i>

147
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,769
Yeah? Where's that, Broadside?

148
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm going to blow up that battleship.

149
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,529
A clear path if ever there was one.

150
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,927
Sir, the navicomputer indicates
we only have one parsec to go.

151
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,561
Good. We will maximize our casualties
with this attack.

152
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,642
General, there's an incoming
transmission fr om Count Dooku.

153
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,679
<i>General Grievous, I have received
intelligence from Lord Sidious.</i>

154
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,523
<i>The Republic has launched
a small strike force</i>

155
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,362
<i>to attack the</i> Malevolence.

156
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:29,319
Let the Republic come!
Our ship is unstoppable!

157
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,404
<i>Skywalker is leading the mission.
Do not underestimate him.</i>

158
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,609
I assure you, Count,
if anything, it is Skywalker

159
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,205
who will underestimate this ship
and its power.

160
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,363
So, Skyguy, how did you know
about this shortcut?

161
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,486
lt's an old smuggler's route.

162
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,640
The pilots used to talk about it
on Tatooine.

163
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,163
Smuggler's route?

164
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,241
Ha! That makes me feel better!

165
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,798
<i>They call it the Balmorra Run.</i>

166
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,039
Balmorra Run?

167
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,325
I think I'm picking up a contact.

168
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,846
Skywalker! Listen to me!
We need to turn around!

169
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,125
We can't.
Not if we're gonna catch Grievous.

170
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:15,641
Another contact! This one's much larger.

171
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:19,120
<i>Skywalker! Balmorra's the nesting ground
of the giant Nebray mantas!</i>

172
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,405
Another? Another!

173
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,638
Take evasive action!

174
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,759
Those gas-gulpers are huge!

175
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,562
Don't shoot, or they'll panic!

176
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:44,443
They'll panic? I'm about to panic!

177
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,009
There are so many of them!

178
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,889
I'm hit! My stabilizer's out!

179
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,449
Pull it together, Matchstick!

180
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,768
I'm okay. I got it.

181
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:11,209
These things are gonna make a meal
out of us!

182
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:14,802
All wings, line up behind me!

183
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:15,959
Roger that, boss.

184
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,249
Hurry! They will not follow us
beyond the nebula.

185
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,009
- That one looks hungry.
- Nah, it s just smiling at you.

186
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,804
We're coming out of it!

187
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,958
Let's hope your shortcut paid off.

188
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,003
We're not far behind Grievous now.

189
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,086
<i>The medical station reports
50% of patients evacuated.</i>

190
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,569
That's not good enough.

191
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,118
They'll never be finished
before the enemy arrives.

192
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:08,963
<i>General Skywalker still has a chance
to catch Grievous.</i>

193
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:12,406
- If he does, we have to be ready.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

194
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:25,808
Shadow 2,
what is the damage to your ship?

195
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,324
Just a scratch, sir.

196
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,368
We must not take
any more unnecessary risks.

197
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,478
If we lose even a single ship,
our mission is that much closer to failure.

198
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,687
Understood, Master Plo.
But we didn't lose any ships, and I didn't...

199
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,523
<i>- Sir, another contact!</i>
- I thought those things wouldn't follow us.

200
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:44,807
Not following, coming out of hyperspace.
lt's a ship.

201
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,281
<i>lt's the</i> Malevolence.

202
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,606
A squadron of Republic fighters
is approaching.

203
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,009
Skywalker!

204
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:09,807
Launch fighters and bring the ship around.

205
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,007
There are several medical
transports surrounding the station.

206
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,360
Target the transports first!
I want every single ship destroyed!

207
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,918
Roger, roger.

208
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,490
Ha! This is too easy!

209
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,488
We've got fighters coming in!

210
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,839
<i>Hold it steady.
Come on, hold it steady.</i>

211
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,047
Charge the ion cannon and prepare to fire!

212
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,883
But, sir, our fighters
will be caught in the blast.

213
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,608
Fire at my command!

214
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,487
- Get those fighters off of us!
- Your fancy flying is making it difficult!

215
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,885
Fire!

216
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,164
- Incoming!
- Make towards the edge of the ray! Now!

217
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,002
Give it everything you've got.

218
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,049
Shadow 2, your speed is dropping.
What's wr ong?

219
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,485
Nothing, sir.
Just trying to keep it together.

220
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,959
You can make it, Matchstick.

221
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,125
<i>Hang on!</i>

222
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:41,925
<i>Watch out!</i>

223
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:55,608
Shadow Squadron, check in.

224
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,205
We lost Matchstick and Tag.

225
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,769
<i>Shadows 6, 7 and 10
were caught in the ray.</i>

226
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:10,958
It looks as though Skywalker has failed.
He's lost almost half his ships.

227
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,369
We should go, madam.

228
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,009
I will stay.

229
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,285
Stay on course.

230
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,083
This flak is heavy!

231
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,723
All deflectors, double front!

232
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,286
Master! We need a new plan!

233
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,287
We can make it, Ahsoka. Hang in there.

234
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,366
Sir, the enemy fighters are closing.

235
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:41,320
Let them come! Prepare the ion cannon.

236
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:46,922
First we will destroy the medical station,
then we will finish off Skywalker.

237
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,240
I have a bad feeling about this.

238
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,602
Watch those towers, boys!

239
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,049
We're too close! Loosen up!

240
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,844
Ion cannon ready.

241
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,559
They're targeting the station.
We're running out of time.

242
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,483
Master! You can make it,
but everyone else is getting shot down!

243
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,084
<i>Master!</i>

244
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,802
Station has been targeted.

245
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,438
Start the ion cannon acceleration.

246
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,087
If we can do enough damage,

247
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:33,048
the weapon may overload
when Grievous tries to fire.

248
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,528
Shadow Squadron, new target.

249
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,567
<i>We're taking out the starboard ion cannon.</i>

250
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,765
Ion cannon, 75% charged.

251
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,085
Hurry!

252
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,039
Torpedoes away!

253
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,565
Fire!

254
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,803
Good work, Shadow Squadron!

255
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:36,962
<i>Nice job, Ahsoka!</i>

256
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,128
Damage report.

257
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,405
We've lost both primary weapons.

258
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,848
- The hyperdrive has been disabled.
- Impossible!

259
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,569
General, we are picking up
three Republic warships

260
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,878
entering the system.

261
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:07,281
- Anakin, do you copy?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

262
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,487
Congratulations. It looks
like your mission was a success.

263
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,279
Partially, but Grievous is still alive.

264
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:17,729
The battle was pretty rough on my men.
We're heading for the medical station.

265
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:19,687
We'll take it from here.

266
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,965
But don't worry,
we'll call when we need you.

267
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,403
<i>I'll be waiting, Obi-Wan.</i>

268
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,369
All right, let's finish what Anakin started.
Ahead full.

269
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,966
Full retreat! Make for Separatist space.

270
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,726
Great job, Master Skywalker.

271
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,961
Your leadership skills
are most impressive.

272
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,768
You didn't do so bad yourself.

273
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:03,247
Uh, excuse me, I believe it was
my suggestion to change the plan.

274
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:07,005
- That's kind of true, Snips.
- From a certain point of view.

275
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,243
Make sure our ships are ready.

276
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,969
We'll only have a short time
before Obi-Wan calls us for support.

277
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,369
Yes, sir.

278
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:28,089
General Skywalker, I wanted to
thank you for your valiant effort today.

279
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,683
Do not take the lives you saved lightly.

280
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:35,126
I don t. But I also can't take
the lives I lost lightly.

281
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,559
I see.

282
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,327
If you will excuse me,
I must prepare for the coming battle.

283
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:48,448
Your master is a very curious Jedi.

284
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,807
He is one of a kind.
