1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,322
Victory on Geonosis!

2
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,441
After a massive planetary siege,

3
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:24,961
the Separatist forces on Geonosis
have finally fallen.

4
00:00:25,042 --> 00:00:27,401
Key weapons factories
have been destroyed,

5
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:30,240
but at a heavy cost to Republic troops.

6
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:34,720
Now, as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli
and Obi-Wan Kenobi

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,239
begin a cleanup of the planet,
they launch an intense campaign

8
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:43,117
to find Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser
and bring him to justice.

9
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:50,077
Sorry to leave you here, Rex.
There's still a lot to do.

10
00:00:50,237 --> 00:00:52,476
You two have done enough
destroying that factory.

11
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,836
Go get some rest.
We'll let General Kenobi take it from here.

12
00:00:55,876 --> 00:00:57,756
We'll be back before you know it,
Captain Rex.

13
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,395
We're ready, sir.

14
00:01:17,433 --> 00:01:21,671
- A hard-won victory.
- Indeed. And a costly one.

15
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:25,750
We suffer a great many losses
in these battles. Too many.

16
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,270
The battles do appear to be coming
with growing frequency.

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,149
- No sign of Poggle, then?
- Nothing.

18
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:36,308
We have clone squadrons spread out
all over the area, but no hits yet.

19
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,708
I'll go out and find some clue
as to where he went.

20
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:39,948
I'm sure the clones can handle...

21
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,347
Poggle has too much information
about the Separatists to let him get away.

22
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:44,987
Very well, Master Unduli.

23
00:01:45,108 --> 00:01:47,986
Just make sure to leave a bit
of strategic planning for me

24
00:01:48,027 --> 00:01:52,146
when I come back, Master Kenobi.
I'd hate to feel left out.

25
00:02:02,985 --> 00:02:04,143
We lost one!

26
00:02:07,384 --> 00:02:10,543
Lord Poggle says leave it.
We gotta keep moving.

27
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,781
What's this?
I didn't expect to find you up and about.

28
00:02:20,822 --> 00:02:22,860
After enough time in a bacta tank,

29
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:26,219
one longs for the mundane comfort
of star charts.

30
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:29,900
It seems like it did you some good.
Your wound looks almost healed.

31
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,779
I wish I could say the same
for most of my men.

32
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:36,858
Well, let's make sure we don't have
to take Geonosis a third time.

33
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:39,817
Poggle's forces seem to have come
from the northern hemisphere.

34
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:43,017
And where was Master Unduli's
last contact made from?

35
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,176
This region, farther to the west,

36
00:02:45,258 --> 00:02:47,976
but there's nothing out there
according to our latest intel.

37
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,895
- There.
- Where?

38
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,735
150 clicks southeast.

39
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,094
It appears to be a munitions container
of some kind.

40
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:01,854
It could just be debris.

41
00:03:02,174 --> 00:03:05,253
I don't think so.
There was no battle in this area.

44
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,531
That makes no sense.

45
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:16,171
Nothing in the temple could have survived
the munitions we used

46
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:20,051
in the first wave of our attack.
Why would he risk exposure to go there?

47
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:21,690
I'm not yet sure.

48
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:25,090
Perhaps he doesn't realize the extent
to which we cleared that area.

49
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,929
Master Luminara, I'm tracking a sandstorm
that's heading your way.

50
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,049
No matter.

51
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:33,809
Poggle is out in the open, and I intend
to grab him before he can get off-world.

52
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,127
I advise against it.
You might get lost in the storm.

53
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:39,887
Then we'd have to find
both you and Poggle.

54
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:42,206
I feel it is a risk worth taking.

55
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:43,527
As you wish.

56
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,686
Let's go.

57
00:03:58,084 --> 00:04:03,563
- OM-5, are you still there?
- Yes. I think I'm right next to you.

58
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,283
Where is Lord Poggle taking us?

59
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:09,562
OM-5? OM-5!

60
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,601
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

61
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:19,041
Don't leave me.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,919
I can't track Poggle in this storm.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,599
We'll reach the temple soon.
We can get out of the storm there.

64
00:04:41,317 --> 00:04:44,916
What could be taking her so long?
Something must have happened.

65
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:48,275
Patience, Skywalker.
It's a delicate operation.

66
00:04:48,316 --> 00:04:51,154
I'm sure we'll have more information soon.

67
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:55,834
I must admit, I am troubled
that we've not heard from her.

68
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:57,753
Let's not start worrying yet.

69
00:04:57,874 --> 00:05:00,793
Luminara's not one
to take unnecessary risks.

70
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:15,470
You were right. He's here somewhere.

71
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,267
Master Kenobi.

72
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:37,827
We tracked Poggle to the Progate Temple,
but now there's no sign of him.

73
00:05:37,868 --> 00:05:40,386
Go no further until we can send support.

74
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:41,866
The storm is making things difficult.

75
00:05:41,987 --> 00:05:44,026
We can barely read
your transmission as it is.

76
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,063
Are you sure he went into the temple?

77
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,023
Yes, we saw him enter, but I think
he's gone down into the catacombs below.

78
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:03,302
Those catacombs go on for miles.
I fear we may have lost him.

79
00:06:03,383 --> 00:06:04,662
Get yourself out of there.

80
00:06:05,863 --> 00:06:08,021
Master Unduli? Master Unduli!

81
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,021
We've lost the connection.

82
00:06:10,102 --> 00:06:12,381
- Where are you going?
- Take a guess.

83
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:15,460
We'll never get to her in this storm.
The gunships can't handle it.

84
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:19,939
- We can't wait!
- I'm sorry, Skywalker. We have no choice.

85
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,939
We must be patient
and trust in Master Unduli.

86
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,538
We'll leave as soon as the storm lifts.

87
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,815
Stay alert, everyone.

88
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,055
Spread out and look around, men.

89
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:52,894
General.

90
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:56,573
Buzz is dead.

91
00:06:56,694 --> 00:06:58,972
- Any sign of Luminara?
- No, sir.

92
00:07:01,213 --> 00:07:03,012
There was a struggle.

93
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:09,530
This is not a good sign.

94
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:12,570
Luminara's lightsaber.

95
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,129
Poggle didn't do this.

96
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,689
But maybe that did.

97
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,489
That is one ugly bug.

98
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:25,008
I haven't seen one
that looks like that before.

99
00:07:25,049 --> 00:07:29,207
I don't believe anyone has.
It could be the Geonosian queen.

100
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:32,727
- The bugs have a queen?
- Mmm. Rumored.

101
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:35,206
But we haven't found
any proof of her existence.

102
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,205
Until now.

103
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:39,606
This way.

104
00:07:39,686 --> 00:07:41,245
Come on, men, let's move.

105
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:08,480
This leads to a dead end.

106
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:13,200
This one goes down the furthest.

107
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,439
- Sir, I'd say that's our best bet.
- I'll go first.

108
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,148
Master Kenobi!

109
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,988
If you're following me,
you must leave this place. Just get out!

110
00:09:24,468 --> 00:09:25,867
I repeat, fall back!

111
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:30,546
She must be close by. Come on!

112
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,664
I don't like the looks of this.

113
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,423
Look out!

114
00:09:57,983 --> 00:09:59,181
I can't stop them!

115
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,499
Oh, no! No!

116
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,259
Back, everyone! Back!

117
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,659
Take out the tunnel supports!
It's the only way!

118
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:29,656
What were those things?
We couldn't kill them.

119
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:34,135
I've heard stories of a Geonosian hive mind
so powerful, so strong,

120
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:38,654
that it can maintain its connection
with its warriors even after they have died.

121
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:40,974
And you think
that's why we couldn't kill them?

122
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,733
- Because they're...
- Already dead, yes.

123
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:47,573
- That can't be true. That's impossible!
- Impossible or not,

124
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:51,892
these creatures keep moving
after we cut them up or shoot them down.

125
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,211
Call for reinforcements.

126
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,650
- There's no signal.
- We must be too deep underground.

127
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:08,249
You two, head back to the surface
and contact General Mundi.

128
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,248
- Tell him we need reinforcements.
- Yes, sir.

129
00:11:12,689 --> 00:11:15,088
I won't be unhappy to get out
from under all this dirt.

130
00:11:17,008 --> 00:11:19,367
This place gives me the shivers.

131
00:11:25,807 --> 00:11:28,486
Wind's probably
playing tricks on us, right?

132
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:29,805
Look around. There's nothing...

133
00:11:30,926 --> 00:11:31,925
What the...

134
00:11:32,966 --> 00:11:34,284
Blast them!

135
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,124
They're not going down!

136
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,844
We have to turn back!

137
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:45,802
Gearshift!

138
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,319
Obviously the thing is a lot more powerful
than we assumed.

139
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,038
I'm going to the surface
to alert General Mundi myself.

140
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,758
I think that would be
a foolhardy move, Anakin.

141
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,557
We can't divide our troops again.

142
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,117
We don't have time to double back
to the surface.

143
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,476
Every moment we waste
puts Luminara in greater danger.

144
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:56,910
The air is warmer here.
We must be getting close.

145
00:12:56,991 --> 00:12:59,590
Forget the heat.

146
00:12:59,671 --> 00:13:02,469
- It smells down here.
- Keep your voice down.

147
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:05,989
I'm just saying.
This planet is rotten from the inside out.

148
00:13:12,348 --> 00:13:14,787
I've got a bad feeling about this.

149
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:17,467
It must be the queen.

150
00:13:17,508 --> 00:13:19,707
- Any sign of Luminara?
I see her.

151
00:13:19,787 --> 00:13:21,306
She's suspended near the throne.

152
00:13:21,507 --> 00:13:25,705
- Perfect. What about Poggle?
- He's speaking with the queen.

153
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,624
Good. You take the soldiers,
I'll take the queen.

154
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,344
Must you always rush into things?

155
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:36,223
Oh, no. You don't actually want
to talk to it, do you?

156
00:13:36,344 --> 00:13:37,423
Matter of fact, I do.

157
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:40,623
Anakin, don't you wonder
why they took Luminara captive?

158
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:43,862
- Why not just kill her?
- She's leverage. She's a hostage.

159
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:47,222
Leverage for what?
No, there's something else going on here,

160
00:13:47,263 --> 00:13:49,182
and these zombies are connected to it.

161
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,260
Fine. We'll try it your way.

162
00:13:51,382 --> 00:13:52,780
So glad you agree.

163
00:13:52,822 --> 00:13:54,740
Cody, set your men up
around the perimeter.

164
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:56,220
These creatures live in darkness.

165
00:13:56,341 --> 00:13:59,060
The light from your helmet
should blind them temporarily.

166
00:13:59,181 --> 00:14:00,499
Turn your lamps on at my signal.

167
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,499
They should create enough confusion
for us to get Luminara out of here.

168
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,619
But what happens when the bugs pursue?

169
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:07,858
You've seen them in action, sir.
We can't kill them.

170
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:10,538
We'll have to bury them.
It'll at least slow them down.

171
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:13,617
Shoot out the support pillars
and this whole place will collapse.

172
00:14:13,738 --> 00:14:15,177
Let's go!

173
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:39,972
How did you know
they wouldn't just attack us?

174
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:45,772
Because I make observations,
while you think with your lightsaber.

175
00:14:52,331 --> 00:14:54,570
Well, that quick thinking of mine
is usually needed

176
00:14:54,691 --> 00:14:56,610
when your observations
get us into trouble.

177
00:14:56,651 --> 00:15:00,928
Anakin, the queen took Luminara hostage.
She wanted a Jedi, now she has two more.

178
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:02,728
I want to know what she's after.

179
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:09,927
Well, when this doesn't go as planned,
which it won't, I'll be ready.

180
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:11,567
That is so reassuring.

181
00:15:14,888 --> 00:15:18,246
I thought I told you not to follow me,
Master Kenobi.

182
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:20,486
Yes, well, I took a lesson from Anakin

183
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:23,765
- and decided not to follow orders.
- Hey!

184
00:15:24,326 --> 00:15:25,604
You.

185
00:15:26,085 --> 00:15:29,884
You are the creatures

186
00:15:29,925 --> 00:15:33,763
that attack Geonosia.

187
00:15:33,844 --> 00:15:40,482
Why have you come before me?

188
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:44,561
Your Majesty,
it is a pleasure to finally meet you.

189
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:47,921
I am Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and this is Anakin Skywalker.

190
00:15:48,002 --> 00:15:51,840
It is our sad duty to inform you
that your rule is at an end.

191
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:58,959
You not dictate to me, Jedi!

192
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:05,677
My empire is forever!

193
00:16:07,358 --> 00:16:10,077
I'm afraid it does not appear
that way, Your Grace.

194
00:16:10,158 --> 00:16:13,876
You shall release the Jedi Luminara
and submit to Republic law.

195
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:28,234
I no submit to you!

196
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,193
No, patience, Anakin. Wait.

197
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:40,631
Majesty, destroying us shall only make
the Republic's judgment of you harsher.

198
00:16:43,032 --> 00:16:46,871
No, Jedi. No!

199
00:16:46,911 --> 00:16:51,029
I no destroy you,

200
00:16:51,071 --> 00:16:54,789
I devour you!

201
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,308
I control you.

202
00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:05,707
I had but one Jedi before
young Poggle bring me,

203
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:12,226
but now I have three!

204
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:17,905
Now, watch as my child

205
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:22,145
enters your Jedi friend.

206
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:25,264
And once inside,

207
00:17:25,304 --> 00:17:31,023
her mind becomes my mind,

208
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:35,582
her thoughts, my thoughts.

209
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:39,381
It's a sort of mind control, a hive mind.
She thinks she can possess us.

210
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,661
Great. Find out everything
you wanted to know yet?

211
00:17:41,742 --> 00:17:43,420
No, wait, I want to see how it works.

212
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:46,060
I don't think Luminara wants to see
how it works.

213
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,500
No, I don't.

214
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,619
I'm curious. The more we know, the better.

215
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,619
I disagree!

216
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,579
- So do I.
- Come, now, the nose or the ear?

217
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,819
Which do you think it will enter?

218
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,057
- I think the nose.
- I hope this is part of the plan.

219
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,297
Isn't it always? Cody! Now!

220
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:24,693
You're coming with us, Poggle!

221
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,211
Obi-Wan, look out!

222
00:18:37,413 --> 00:18:39,011
What? Anakin, no!

223
00:18:39,532 --> 00:18:40,851
Got it.

224
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:43,650
What are you doing?
I was going to study that!

225
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:46,369
Study the bottom of my boot.
Come on, let's get out of here!

226
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:47,849
Here they come!

227
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,088
Take out the supports!

228
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:17,284
They're still coming!

229
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:29,922
This is our way out.

230
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:33,202
Start climbing.

231
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,958
Obi-Wan, look out!

232
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,548
All things considered,
that went better than I expected.

233
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:52,548
I wish we could have gotten
one of those worms.

234
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:56,267
Knowing how the queen controls
her minions could have proven valuable.

235
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,826
Well, hopefully the secret
is buried with her.
