1
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,610
<i>Danger looms!</i>

2
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,290
<i>Despite recent victories
in the Outer Rim,</i>

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,170
<i>criminal minds plot
at the very heart of the Republic.</i>

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,170
<i>The bounty hunter Cad Bane</i>

5
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,770
<i>has assembled some of the deadliest
criminals in the galaxy</i>

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,610
<i>and plans a daring attack
to seize members of the Senate.</i>

7
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,930
<i>What could be the aim
of this despicable act?</i>

8
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,610
Here we go.

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,370
<i>Attention, attention!
This is a restricted area.</i>

10
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:44,010
<i>No landing is permitted
without permission.</i>

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,530
<i>Violators will be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.</i>

12
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,970
Put up your hands.

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,770
I've got business with the Senate.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,970
How about you fellas step aside?

15
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,930
On your knees.
Raise your hands.

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,810
Slowly.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,450
Son,

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,650
I wouldn't be so hasty
if I were you.

19
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,090
Cuff him.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,170
- Where's that coming from?
- I see the shooter up in the tower.

21
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,330
Over there!

22
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:38,290
You two, get these uniforms on
and get this platform clear.

23
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,370
<i>Base to platform.
What was all that? Report.</i>

24
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,530
Protesters against the war.
We've taken care of them.

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,770
Finish getting those uniforms on
and clear this platform, now.

26
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,210
Everybody else,

27
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,050
follow me.

28
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,210
I'm supposed to be
on a meditative retreat.

29
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,130
We should go away together.

30
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,570
I know a place far away from here
where no one would recognise us.

31
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,770
It would be like
we're actually husband and wife,

32
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,290
instead of Senator and Jedi.

33
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,010
- I can't, Ani.
- What do you mean, you can't?

34
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,570
It's only two weeks.

35
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,930
We'll be back before anyone
even notices we're gone.

36
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,490
I have to bring this bill
before the Senate. It's important.

37
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,810
More important
than the way you feel about me?

38
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,130
Not more important,
but important.

39
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,170
The work I do...
The work we both do...

40
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,090
is in service to the Republic.

41
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,250
To protect those who would otherwise
be powerless to protect themselves.

42
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,410
Of course.
But those are ideals.

43
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,690
Isn't our love
more important to you?

44
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,890
- But I--
- No, no "but".

45
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,410
To me,

46
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,530
there's nothing more important
than the way I feel about you.

47
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,490
Nothing.

48
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,610
- Anakin, don't be so--
- You don't believe me.

49
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,450
- I didn't say--
- I'll prove it.

50
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,450
Just watch.

51
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,330
When I finished constructing
my lightsaber, Obi-Wan said to me,

52
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,450
"Anakin, this weapon is your life."

53
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,810
This weapon is my life.

54
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,450
No, Anakin, I can't.
A Jedi lightsaber is...

55
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,370
Wow.

56
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,410
It's heavier than I thought.

57
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,010
It's yours.

58
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,730
Believe me now?

59
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,810
If all you want to do
is make fun of me,

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,290
- I think you should just go.
- That's not what I want.

61
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,170
Not at all.

62
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,650
Stop!

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,610
You know what to do.

64
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,250
I'll figure it out.

65
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,530
You better not fail me,
bubble brain.

66
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,530
Don't worry,
I'll have the power out in no time.

67
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,730
The rest of you come with me.

68
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:34,010
But, Senator Organa,
it just wouldn't be...

69
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,170
Quick, hide!

70
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,090
Now stand aside.

71
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,610
I apologise for my abruptness.

72
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,490
Senator Organa,
how good to see you.

73
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,770
What is it?

74
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,370
Senator Filo has called
a meeting in the lobby

75
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,610
before we vote
on the Enhanced Privacy Invasion Bill.

76
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,690
Right,
Privacy Invasion Bill.

77
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,690
We must hurry
if we are to stop the vote.

78
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,290
Coming, Senator Amidala?

79
00:04:58,850 --> 00:04:59,770
Of course.

80
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,570
Quietly.

81
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,250
Guard change happens... now.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,930
Here we go.

83
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,210
Now let's go talk to some senators.

84
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,970
Help me.

85
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,170
No!

86
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,330
We cannot allow the Chancellor

87
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,210
to move this Enhanced Privacy
Invasion Bill forward.

88
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,170
We are all in agreement then.

89
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,690
Morning, Senators.

90
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,650
You should all consider yourselves
to be in my power.

91
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,490
As long as everybody behaves
this will be quick and painless.

92
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,250
Do nothing,
and it will all be over soon.

93
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,130
I don't know
who you think you are

94
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:18,890
but I for one have no intention
of listening to this kind of insolence.

95
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,610
All right, then.

96
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,290
If you all gather at the center
of this lovely atrium,

97
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,250
my co-workers and I will relieve you
of any communication devices.

98
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,130
I see five of them here in the room.
If we--

99
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,530
What are you going to do?
It's not like we carry weapons.

100
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,730
Chancellor Palpatine.

101
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,210
What is it, Senator Free Taa?

102
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,770
I think you should see this.

103
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,050
<i>Sorry to bother you, Chancellor,</i>

104
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,930
<i>but I've taken control of the east wing
of your Senate building,</i>

105
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,970
<i>and the occupants
are now my hostages.</i>

106
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,770
<i>If you care about them,</i>

107
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,690
<i>I'd advise you to free Ziro the Hutt
from the detention center.</i>

108
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,610
You should know that the Republic
does not take kindly to such threats.

109
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,610
If you have attempted such a fool-hardy
action as to kidnap a senator,

110
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:15,090
I assure you that it will be met
with appropriate force.

111
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,850
This ought to do it.

112
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:26,930
What's going on?

113
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,570
<i>I'm in control.</i>

114
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,290
<i>I make the rules now.</i>

115
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,630
Orn Free Taa,
help me with this door.

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,550
It's no use, sir.

117
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:41,390
Someone's gotten
to the central control panel.

118
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,870
They've triggered
the security system.

119
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,430
The Senate buildings
have sealed themselves.

120
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,390
This is Chancellor Palpatine.

121
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,950
There is an emergency
at the Senate building.

122
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,030
Jedi Council, come in.

123
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:55,550
Is anyone there?

124
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,470
That's no use either, sir.

125
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,550
They've cut off all communication
with the outside.

126
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,550
Hand over your
communication devices, please.

127
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,070
- I can't let them search me.
- What?

128
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,150
Why not?

129
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,550
- I have something they must not find.
- What is it?

130
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,950
Well,
hello there, little lady.

131
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,070
And who might you be?

132
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,190
I am Padmé Amidala,

133
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,590
Senator from Naboo.

134
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,750
And I demand
that you release us immediately.

135
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,990
The Galactic Senate
will not treat with terrorists.

136
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,750
Ain't you awful young and pretty
to be a senator?

137
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,710
Skywalker?!
After him!

138
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,710
Hello, come in.
Anyone there?

139
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:01,911
Uh-oh.

140
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,970
This is General Skywalker.
Chancellor Palpatine,

141
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,310
- <i>can you hear me?</i>
- My dear boy,

142
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,510
I'm glad to know
you're there and all right.

143
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:26,310
- <i>What is going on down there?</i>
- I hear it too.

144
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,710
Coming from up ahead.

145
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,550
<i>They've sealed the entire building.
Nobody can get in</i>

146
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,830
<i>and we cannot get out.</i>

147
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,630
<i>It's up to you. You have to
get to the power control room</i>

148
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,950
<i>and turn off the security seal.</i>

149
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,630
You have two more floors to check.

150
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,150
Come on.
We've got two more floors to check.

151
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,710
You take downstairs,
I'll go up.

152
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,910
We'll meet on the other side.

153
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,350
No lightsaber cuts?

154
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,550
Interesting.

155
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,790
What happened?
Where's the droid?

156
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:34,510
The droid's gone,

157
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,150
but there's good news.

158
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,990
- The Jedi's unarmed.
- What?

159
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:43,910
It doesn't look like
he has his lightsaber.

160
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,150
Go, bring him back to me.

161
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:05,230
- The lightsaber, I've got it.
- What?

162
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,310
Why do you have a Jedi's lightsaber?

163
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,230
The question is whether we should
try and get it back to A--

164
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:15,670
...the Jedi knight
or use it ourselves.

165
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,950
Everybody quiet.
I've got a call to make.

166
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,910
<i>So here's what you're going to do.</i>

167
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,110
<i>First you're going to
make a pardon disc.</i>

168
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,670
- <i>You can give it to your friend there.</i>
- Me?

169
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,870
<i>My ship will come and pick him up
and take him to the prison.</i>

170
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,270
<i>Once Ziro has been released
and is handed over to me,</i>

171
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,830
<i>then your associate will be released.
Understand?</i>

172
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,510
Oh, I do.

173
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:47,950
But I feel it is my duty
to warn you

174
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,230
that you will end up
paying for this outrage.

175
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,310
<i>I can live with that.</i>

176
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,550
Come on, open the door.

177
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,150
I won't hurt you.

178
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,070
Well, well,
what have we here?

179
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:06,950
Blast it!

180
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,230
Tie your little pet up.
We'll bring him to Bane.

181
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,190
Here's the pardon disc.

182
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,950
Let's go.

183
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,710
Why do I have to
go to the jail for this?

184
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,910
- Move it.
- Sorry, Senator.

185
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,670
But everyone has a job to do.

186
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,350
Hurry up.

187
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,390
Young Skywalker.

188
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,830
Not so impressive
without your lightsaber,

189
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,350
are you, Jedi?

190
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,590
Toss him in with the others.

191
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,870
3D, are we on schedule?

192
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,380
Arriving at the prison now.

193
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,860
Unlock the doors.

194
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,180
- It's so bright out here!
- Oh, my God.

195
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,020
Why couldn't they do this at night
when it's cooler?

196
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,860
Go and get the parting gifts.

197
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,780
Look at Senator Orn Free Taa.

198
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,220
He looks so unhappy.

199
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,380
Now get me as far away
from Coruscant as possible!

200
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,780
Now!

201
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,260
<i>Well, Mr. Chancellor,</i>

202
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,980
<i>thanks to your calm leadership,
the crisis is passed.</i>

203
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,980
<i>I got what I want,</i>

204
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,700
<i>so I'll return your Senate
and your senators.</i>

205
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,220
<i>Enjoy them,</i>

206
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,580
<i>but don't try anything
until the sun has set.</i>

207
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,340
<i>Understand?</i>

208
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,060
We are to rendezvous
back at the Senate building.

209
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,420
What?!

210
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,180
No, no, no, no!

211
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,300
The Outer Rim, not the Senate,
you stupid machine!

212
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,420
We need to
get to the landing platform.

213
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,500
- Is everything ready?
- Yep, yep.

214
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,180
Turn on the field.

215
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,220
If you so much as breathe
on one of these lasers,

216
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,060
the whole room will blow up.

217
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,140
Senators, Jedi,

218
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,780
I bid you all
the most respectful farewell.

219
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,300
Let's go.

220
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,020
All clear!

221
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,980
- Sir, are you all right?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

222
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,380
Mission accomplished, sir.

223
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,020
<i>The Chancellor is safe.</i>

224
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,380
Well done, trooper.

225
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,460
<i>You were foolish to think you could
get away with this, bounty hunter.</i>

226
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,060
<i>Now lay down your arms
and come quietly.</i>

227
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,860
No, Chancellor.

228
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,220
I am afraid it is you
who have been foolish

229
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,140
with your senators' lives.

230
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,060
<i>One false move</i>

231
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,500
<i>and the east wing of the Senate building
goes up in smoke.</i>

232
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,140
Please, Ani, wake up.

233
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,460
You win, bounty hunter.

234
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,660
Holster!

235
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,420
Stand down.

236
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,020
What are you looking so sad about?

237
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,900
The bounty hunter said
we should just sit here.

238
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,100
I think we should just sit here.

239
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Well,
that's not a very good idea.

240
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:07,300
Come on.

241
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,940
Let's get going.

242
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,500
Too bad
I don't have my lightsaber.

243
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,620
You mean this?

244
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,420
I found it
where you dropped it.

245
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,380
Now, quickly.
We don't have much time.

246
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,020
Well, Hutt,

247
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,460
it doesn't look like prison had
too adverse an effect on you.

248
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,380
You can't imagine
the unspeakable things I've suffered.

249
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,700
The horror!

250
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,060
I doubt I'll ever really recover.

251
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,760
How about some dead senators
as payback?

252
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,400
Another daring rescue,
Master Jedi.

253
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,540
I do my best, Senator.

254
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:20,580
Congratulations
on a job well done,

255
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,100
bounty hunter.

256
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,020
Time to pay up, Hutt.

257
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,620
I don't work for free.
