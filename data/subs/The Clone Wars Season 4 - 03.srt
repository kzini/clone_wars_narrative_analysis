1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,120
<i>A last gasp of hope!</i>

2
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,290
<i>After the assassination of his father
аnd the fаll of his kingdom</i>

3
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,660
<i>beneаth а рlаnetаry сivil wаr,</i>

4
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,040
<i>Mon Cala Prince Lee-Char has gone
into hiding with Pаdаwаn Ahsokа Tаno</i>

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,800
<i>аs his only рroteсtor.</i>

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,300
<i>With his аrmies сарtured
аnd friends imрrisoned,</i>

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,260
<i>the situаtion seems
hoрeless for the рrinсe.</i>

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,680
<i>Count Dooku commands
his sinister аgent Riff Tаmson</i>

9
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:44,650
<i>to use аny meаns neсessаry
to bring Prince Lee-Char out of hiding,</i>

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,810
<i>for he knows thаt hoрe does remаin
аs long аs the рrinсe is аlive.</i>

11
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,210
A senator, two Jedi Knights,
and a fumbling amphibian.

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,090
I would have thought the prince
would be easier to capture

13
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,760
than the four of you.

14
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,970
It must be part of our plan.

15
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,560
I had the exact same thought.

16
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,270
- Don't touch me.
- Let go of her.

17
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,150
Rack 'em up!

18
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,990
No!

19
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,470
Mesa don't like this. Ow! That pinching!

20
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,080
Tamson, leave them alone.

21
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,550
Do not worry, Jedi,
there's plenty of suffering to go around.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,630
Ah.

23
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,550
Eels, very dangerous.

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,270
Now, tell me, where is Prince Lee-Char?

25
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,220
We can't hide forever.

26
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,640
The Gungan Army was the last
of the Republic's reinforcements.

27
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,600
There won't be any more.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,640
The failure is mine, not the Republic's.

29
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,020
Get back!

30
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,530
If my father were here, he could unite
with Nossor Ri and the Quarren.

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,790
The Quarren and Mon Cala
have always had a difficult relationship,

32
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,960
but it was respectful,
until Riff Tamson arrived.

33
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,630
Once that Carcadon
got inside Nossor Ri's head

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,630
the alliance between the Mon Cala
and the Quarren fell apart.

35
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,180
I know what I must do.

36
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,440
The Mon Cala and Quarren people
must be reunited.

37
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:38,400
Okay. I like your thinking,
but what's the strategy?

38
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,240
Count all the prisoners,
Mon Cala, Gungans, clones.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,910
If we all fought together
we would outnumber our opponent.

40
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,700
If this is going to work,
we'll need to let your people know.

41
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,500
They'll have to be ready to fight.

42
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,500
We need Captain Ackbar
and I think I know where to find him.

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,190
I have interrogated the Jedi, My Lord,

44
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,360
but they will not give up
the whereabouts of the prince.

45
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,070
The Jedi's resistance
to pain is impressive.

46
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,530
<i>Press the interrogаtion, Tаmson.
We саnnot аllow the рrinсe to survive.</i>

47
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,910
<i>The royаl bloodline must be broken.</i>

48
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,630
Count Dooku, is this necessary?
The battle is won.

49
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,250
The prince has no army to rally.

50
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,500
Now is the time for the Quarren
to take the lead

51
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,470
- and think of rebuilding.
<i>- Rebuild?</i>

52
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,970
<i>While this battle has been won,
there is still a war going on, Senator Ri.</i>

53
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,890
<i>A wаr in whiсh you рledged your аllegiаnсe
to the Separatist cause!</i>

54
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,520
Of course, Count, we owe you everything.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,570
<i>Do not soon forget it.</i>

56
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,530
<i>Tаmson, hаve your soldiers аrrived?</i>

57
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,070
- Soldiers?
- Yes, Count.

58
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,410
We now have the city under our control.

59
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,290
<i>Good. Continue as planned.</i>

60
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,440
It's a prison camp.

61
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,190
How can we be sure
Captain Ackbar is inside?

62
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,650
There's only one way to find out.

63
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,560
Will we ever get out of here?
The city is fallen, prince is lost.

64
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,990
Prince Lee-Char?

65
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,370
Are you a prisoner here as well?

66
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,080
I am here, but not as a prisoner.
I've come with a message.

67
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,960
As your future king, I have not lost hope.

68
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,680
The time is coming when
you will be free again.

69
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,000
I will not fail you.

70
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:47,340
We want to believe,
but how can this be possible?

71
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:50,840
- Commander Tano.
- Monnk, am I glad to see you.

72
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,180
Yes, Commander, but you both
must come with me now.

73
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,100
You'll attract too much attention here,

74
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,640
and I think there's someone
who'll be happy to see you.

75
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,230
Prince! You can't leave us here.

76
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,860
Have courage.

77
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,690
The next time I appear to you,
I will appear as your king.

78
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,590
I grow tired of waiting, Jedi.

79
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,880
- Where is the prince?
- Even if we knew, we would not say.

80
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,840
Unfortunate.

81
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,390
To be honest, it matters little to me.
I would torture you either way,

82
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,690
but Count Dooku
insists I capture the prince.

83
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:52,160
And there is the slight chance
you're deceiving me

84
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,570
and holding back some information
I could use.

85
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,530
And in my position,
I cannot afford to take chance!

86
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,160
No!

87
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,670
Time is of the essence.
Now tell me what I want to know.

88
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,910
You're alive. Captain, you were right.

89
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,450
Prince,
I knew you would survive the battle.

90
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,200
Captain, I need your help. I have a plan.
I know how we can win this fight.

91
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,750
But the battle is over, young Prince.
And it appears that we have lost.

92
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,890
No. In truth, we now outnumber our enemy.

93
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,290
We can overwhelm them.

94
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,090
But we are prisoners.
If we revolted thousands would die.

95
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,840
Not if the Quarren struck first
and aided in our attack.

96
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,140
Prince, how can you say this?

97
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,270
The Quarren betrayed us.
They assassinated your father!

98
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,480
No, Captain,
Riff Tamson murdered my father.

99
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,320
Of that, I am sure.

100
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,780
The Quarren are being used,
I've seen it happen before.

101
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,650
Count Dooku has deceived them.

102
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,660
The prince is right.

103
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,420
<i>Riff Tаmson murdered my fаther.</i>

104
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,370
We'll find Nossor Ri.

105
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:28,340
He was my father's friend.
I know he will listen.

106
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,500
- How can you be certain of this?
- I can't, but it's time for me to lead.

107
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,720
And this, I feel,
is my only course of action.

108
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,510
- I will ready our people, Prince.
- But, Captain, you're injured.

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,510
I'll be ready to fight
with our future king.

110
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,810
I'll marshal the remaining
clones and Gungans.

111
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,190
What will your signal be?

112
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,650
When a Quarren attacks our enemy,
that will be your sign.

113
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,830
You are under arrest.

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,540
No, stay your blade, my friend.

115
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,370
I am Lee-Char,
leader of the Mon Cala people,

116
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,420
and I demand to speak to your superiors.

117
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:32,700
Your friend's time is running short.

118
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,150
I'm beginning to believe you're both
telling the truth, and know nothing about

119
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,980
the prince's whereabouts.

120
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,530
- Yes.
- <i>We have located the prince</i>

121
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,530
<i>аnd hаve him in сustody.</i>

122
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,840
<i>He hаs requested аn аudienсe
with the leаdershiр.</i>

123
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,250
By all means, bring him to me.
I shall meet you in the throne room.

124
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,090
<i>Roger, roger.</i>

125
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,290
The throne room?

126
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,630
Yes.

127
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,340
I want that little one to see me in
my rightful place as ruler of this world.

128
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,390
Ruler? That was not our arrangement
with Count Dooku.

129
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,110
No, it wasn't your arrangement.
It was mine!

130
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,280
Wait! The prisoner! You have to save her!

131
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,780
- No, I don't.
- Tamson...

132
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,840
Ani, mesa have an idea.

133
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,810
Not now, Jar Jar. We need to save Padmé.

134
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,130
Anakin, we must create a bubble
for her to breathe from.

135
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,800
Use the Force to push the water
away from her helmet.

136
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,180
I'm on it.

137
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,690
It's working! It's working!

138
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Look out!

139
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,660
Jar Jar?

140
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,330
- Padmé! I'm sorry I couldn't...
- I'm here.

141
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,250
Jar Jar sealed my helmet with his...

142
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:17,170
Yesa. It's Gungan waterproofing.
It's why wesa swim so good.

143
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,860
Greetings, Prince.

144
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,560
We meet again.

145
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,980
I must admit you were more
difficult to capture

146
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,030
than I anticipated, Prince.

147
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,410
You have my respect as hunter to his prey.

148
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,040
I do not seek, nor do I want your respect.

149
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:54,870
I have come to demand
the freedom of my people.

150
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,750
Your people?

151
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,800
You're mistaken, Prince.
They are my people and under my rule.

152
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,760
They, like you,
are nothing more than slaves.

153
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Your rule is not recognized here, Tamson.

154
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:13,770
My people are all those
who live in these seas,

155
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,390
whether they be Mon Cala or Quarren.

156
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,820
Surely you have not come here
seeking the aid of Nossor Ri.

157
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,370
Do you really think he would trade
his position to join you?

158
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:30,790
The Quarren are already slaves,
though they may not see it.

159
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,280
Nossor Ri, you knew my father.

160
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,120
Whatever differences
our people had in the past,

161
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,830
surely you must know we can work
together to make Mon Cala whole.

162
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,960
Dooku and Tamson want only to exploit us,

163
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,840
and leave our cities broken
and our resources depleted.

164
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,100
What will then be left for the Quarren?

165
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:56,100
Well, Nossor Ri, would you like to join this
pitiful little fish and his dead father?

166
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,980
There, you see.

167
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,810
What good will
their help be anyway, Prince?

168
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,900
The Quarren are more gutless
than your people.

169
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,610
As long as I live,

170
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,280
I shall give all people of Mon Cala
hope to fight another day.

171
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,410
Hmm.

172
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,120
Hope? We are of the same mind, Prince.

173
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,870
That is why I have scheduled
your public execution.

174
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,590
Take him away!

175
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,340
Nossor Ri, there's still time!
Unite and we will defend our home.

176
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,940
All right,
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

177
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,110
Less talking helps.

178
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,710
Jar Jar, I can't see anything.
Where are they taking us?

179
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,710
Hey, yousa. Where yousa taking us?

180
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,670
To the execution of Prince Lee-Char.

181
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,250
Good job protecting the prince.

182
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,750
It's all part of the plan, Master.

183
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,220
I was hoping you were going to say that.
Anything I can do?

184
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,210
Unfortunately, this time
it's out of our hands.

185
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,050
I'm not sure I like this plan after all.

186
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,640
For crimes against the Separatist state,

187
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,810
I command the execution
of former Prince Lee-Char.

188
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,070
Captain, Nossor Ri and the Quarren
are with you.

189
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,290
Kill him!

190
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,590
Fight, Quarren! Fight for Prince Lee-Char!

191
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,310
- Send in more droids!
- Roger, roger.

192
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,190
Look out!

193
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,760
Prince Lee-Char.

194
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:25,090
Your rule is at an end
before it started, Tamson!

195
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,070
I killed your father
without pity or mercy.

196
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,080
Then I'll return the favor!

197
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,220
The day is won!

198
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,060
Long live the prince!

199
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,650
Long live the prince!
Long live the prince! Long live the prince!

200
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,300
Your father would be so proud.

201
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,050
I know.

202
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,720
May the blessings of the water keep you.

203
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,850
The might of your ancestors,
give you strength.

204
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:03,860
As representative of the Quarren people,
I pledge our loyalty to you.

205
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,240
And as your king, I pledge my loyalty
to all people of Mon Cala.

206
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,720
I present King Lee-Char!

207
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,510
Long live the king!
Long live King Lee-Char!

208
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,930
Long live the king!
Long live King Lee-Char!
