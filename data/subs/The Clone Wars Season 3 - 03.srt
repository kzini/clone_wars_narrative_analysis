1
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:19,620
A world under siege!

2
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,790
The Separatists have launched
a massive offensive

3
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,620
against the planet Ryloth.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,120
A blockade of deadly battleships
has cut off any support

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,420
for the dwindling Republic defenses.

6
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,130
Though they have fought valiantly

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,090
with the help of
Twi'lek freedom fighter Cham Syndulla,

8
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,690
hope is fading for Jedi Master Di
and his men as the droid army closes in.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,700
Master Jedi!

10
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,540
We're running out of food and water,

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,000
and our heavy weapons systems
are out of power.

12
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,500
I'll contact our forces in orbit.

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,010
Admiral Dao, this is General Di.
We're in trouble down here.

14
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,090
We need those supplies immediately.

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,510
I understand, General,
but I am in no position to help.

16
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,180
We are critically low
on fuel and ammunition.

17
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,600
Contact the Jedi Council again!

18
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,810
Tell them reinforcements
must be dispatched without delay!

19
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,530
If help does not arrive soon, the entire
Outer Rim garrison will be wiped out.

20
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,596
Surely there must be
something you can do...

21
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,450
The main reactor's been hit, sir.
Systems are shutting down.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,500
We are dead in space.

23
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,040
With regret, I report that
my fleet will no longer be able

24
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,710
to provide protection for
the troops on Ryloth.

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,630
I repeat my request
that help be sent right away.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,640
The shields are gone! We have no...

27
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,720
Trapped on Ryloth,
Master Di and his men are.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,490
My trade mission was successful.
Thank you for asking.

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,280
But what's the matter?
You all look very somber.

30
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,320
Senator, the fleet protecting Ryloth
has been destroyed,

31
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,660
and the supply lines have been cut.

32
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:27,410
The troops are out of food,
fuel, ammunition,

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,660
and the civilian population is starving.

34
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,330
That is grim news.

35
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Our blockade runners should be able
to penetrate the Separatist lines

36
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,420
and drop relief supplies,

37
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,680
but they do not have the range
to reach Ryloth.

38
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,090
The planet Toydaria is 2,000 parsecs closer
than the nearest fleet.

39
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,430
If the blockade runners
can supply from there,

40
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,400
they might reach Ryloth in time.

41
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,060
What would you have me do?

42
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:54,150
We've dispatched a ship loaded with
relief supplies to meet you on Toydaria.

43
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,770
You are a more experienced diplomat

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,480
than the representative from Naboo
who is already there.

45
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,950
Senator Amidala is
an excellent negotiator. I am sure...

46
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,570
Senator Amidala
could not leave the Senate.

47
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,740
Representative Binks
accompanied the shipment.

48
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:11,620
You must negotiate the treaty so that
we can dispatch ships from Toydaria

49
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,040
and get Ryloth the
relief supplies it needs.

50
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,710
I understand perfectly.

51
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,020
This had better be important.

52
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,810
Sir, we intercepted a coded transmission

53
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,770
between Senator Organa
and the Jedi Council.

54
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,030
We were able to partially unscramble it.

55
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,210
The Jedi have sent Senator Organa
to Toydaria to negotiate a treaty,

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,240
which would allow them to send
relief supplies to their forces on Ryloth.

57
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:54,160
Send a message to Senator Lott Dod
of the Trade Federation.

58
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,130
I wish to speak with him immediately.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,950
Stop where you are, offworlder.

60
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
We will provide you whatever you need
to continue your journey,

61
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,710
but you may not leave this ship.

62
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,300
I am Senator Bail Organa
of the Galactic Republic.

63
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,050
I come to speak with
the High Exalted King of Toydaria.

64
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,810
Hi-lo!

65
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,430
Let meesa through!
Meesa on a diplomatic mission.

66
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,190
Senator Organa!
Itsa pleasure to be seeing yousa.

67
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,350
And you, Representative Binks. Shall we?

68
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,690
Our laws of hospitality
demand that we offer assistance,

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,120
but this planet is closed to offworlders.

70
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,780
We are obliged to deliver our message
to your king in person.

71
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,960
It won't take a minute.

72
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,670
Hi-lo? Yousa Majesty?

73
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,510
Let me do the talking, okay?

74
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,940
State your business, offworlders.

75
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:39,190
Representative Binks of Naboo.

76
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,610
Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan, sire.
We have come to ask for your help.

77
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:47,780
Perhaps you failed to pay attention
to the Senate orientation.

78
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,620
They should have explained
that Toydaria is a neutral system.

79
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,870
We are not part of the Republic.

80
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,990
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
That is why we have come before you
as friends.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,830
There is a humanitarian crisis on Ryloth.

83
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,090
Millions will be starving and dying
without your help.

84
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:08,470
My esteemed colleague and I humbly beg

85
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,510
that you allow us to use Toydaria
as a staging ground

86
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,770
to supply the planet with relief aid.

87
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,930
Do not make your decision in haste,
Your Majesty.

88
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,900
There are other factors
you might wish to consider.

89
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,200
I believe you know Lott Dod,
Senator for the Trade Federation.

90
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,500
Yes, we are acquainted. Senator.

91
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,630
Begging Your Highness,
whatsa he doing here?

92
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,300
Why shouldn't he be?

93
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,840
Toydaria has an important contract
with his Trade Federation.

94
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,140
The Trade Federation is too chummy
with the Separatists for my taste.

95
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,680
We have nothing to do
with the Separatists!

96
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,980
Nute Gunray is an extremist.

97
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,230
His views do not reflect
those of the Trade Federation.

98
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,690
Perhaps not.
But you can understand the confusion.

99
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,690
We are only here to ensure that
nothing jeopardizes the agreement

100
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,530
between Toydaria
and the Trade Federation.

101
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,710
Naboo and Alderaan have a long tradition
of providing humanitarian aid.

102
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,790
- I see no reason for conflict.
- Nor do I.

103
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,580
The people of Ryloth are suffering,

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
and compassion
is a sacred Toydarian value.

105
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,960
Honesty is also a Toydarian value,
is it not?

106
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,760
I'm sure the Senator mentioned
the Separatist blockade around Ryloth.

107
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,720
A blockade? Is this true?

108
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,400
Yes, Your Majesty, but it changes nothing.

109
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,320
It changes everything.

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,570
If the Separatists are blockading
the planet and we help the Republic,

111
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,920
it will destroy our neutrality.

112
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:01,240
I must convene my ministers,
then we shall hear your arguments.

113
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,650
General Di, the right flank has collapsed.

114
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
The droids will be closing in
on our position.

115
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,780
What about reinforcements?

116
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,910
Communication has been spotty.

117
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,790
I promise you, Cham,
the Republic will not abandon Ryloth.

118
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,120
I've heard enough of your promises, Jedi.

119
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,510
The fact remains, if we stay here without
reinforcements, we're all going to die.

120
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,720
Gobi, tell the people we're leaving.

121
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,010
Yes, sir.

122
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,640
I don't think you understand.

123
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,390
The right flank has collapsed.
There's no leaving.

124
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,770
We're stuck here together.

125
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:10,400
We will now hear arguments
in the matter of using Toydarian territory

126
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,240
to aid the shipment of relief supplies
to the citizens of Ryloth.

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,740
- Senator Organa.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

128
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,990
The operation the Republic proposes
is purely humanitarian.

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,460
We wish to deliver food and
medical supplies to the people of Ryloth.

130
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:33,500
But if you won't listen to me, wise king,
listen to Senator Orn Free Taa of Ryloth,

131
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,840
who is well aware
of the suffering of his people.

132
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:41,810
Your Highness, our cities lie in ruins.

133
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:48,180
Our transportation hubs are all but
destroyed, so I cannot return home.

134
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,230
Our crops burn.

135
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:57,070
The Twi'lek people are starving,
and they will die if no aid comes to them.

136
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,280
I appeal to you, great king.

137
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,460
The basic tenets of our morality,
and even our constitution,

138
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,960
demand that we help those in need.

139
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,060
Those ideals are noble,
but we must be careful

140
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:20,220
that our compassion does not
draw us into this war.

141
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,720
Senator Dod, if you please.

142
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:27,890
Great king,
Senator Organa is deceiving you.

143
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:34,690
The inconvenient fact remains that
this is a war, and Ryloth is a battlefield.

144
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,820
The planet is under a Separatist blockade
because Jedi Knights and clone soldiers

145
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,620
are battling the droid army
for control of the surface.

146
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,620
This will not be a humanitarian base.

147
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,370
It will be a military base.

148
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,840
The Separatist Senate will see it
as a violation of your neutrality.

149
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,590
That, in turn, will expose
the Trade Federation's ships

150
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,600
to attacks from the Separatists

151
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,260
and force us to cease trade with Toydaria,
a situation desirable to no one.

152
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,520
Your Majesty, the people of Ryloth
did not ask to be invaded.

153
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,610
Do not let them suffer
because war came to them.

154
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,610
I sympathize with
the plight of the Twi'leks,

155
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,580
but this is not about saving them when
they are fighting against the Separatists.

156
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,950
Thank you, Senators.

157
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,540
You have given us much to consider.

158
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,670
I will summon you
once I have made my decision.

159
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,170
Come on, hurry, hurry!

160
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,470
Captain, is the gunship ready?

161
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,060
Yes, sir, but it's too small
to evacuate the refugees.

162
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,140
No escape? But our families are with us.

163
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:59,360
If we reconfigure the fuel system,
we can turn the ship

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,280
into a bomb big enough
to collapse the pass, here.

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,080
The enemy will then only be able to
engage us on one front, from this ravine.

166
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,870
While we provide cover,

167
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,250
the Twi'leks will have time to escape
with the families over the mountain.

168
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,840
Brilliant strategy, General.
I'll go tell the men.

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:28,220
After considerable debate,
I have made my decision.

170
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,690
I am sorry, Senator Organa.

171
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:35,310
But for the sake of my people,
Toydaria must remain neutral.

172
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,330
A wise ruling, Your Majesty.

173
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,450
That did not go well.

174
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,870
What are weesa gonna do now?

175
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,330
My friends.

176
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,590
Toydaria cannot turn a blind eye
to the suffering of Ryloth.

177
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,880
The Twi'leks are innocent victims
caught between the warring factions

178
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:06,520
through no fault of their own.

179
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:10,230
I'm glad you agree, Your Highness.
What are you prepared to do?

180
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:14,650
You may use Toydaria to transfer
the supplies you brought with you.

181
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,480
That's only enough food for one,
maybe two rotations.

182
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,480
It will have to do.

183
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,060
And you must guarantee

184
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,320
that the Trade Federation will not be able
to link Toydaria to the mission.

185
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,740
Agreed. I have an idea.

186
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,960
I'll signal you
when the ships are ready to depart.

187
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,670
Meesa won't let you down, Senator.

188
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
We're pleased you could join us, Senator.

189
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,260
- Your Majesty.
- The pleasure is mine.

190
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,140
Formal dinners are so tedious.

191
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,560
I'm afraid that pressing matters require me
to make immediate contact with Alderaan.

192
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,480
But I leave you in the capable hands
of my colleague, Representative Binks.

193
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:19,460
General, we're loading the rest of
the explosives onto the gunship.

194
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,290
Very good, Captain. Ready the men.

195
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:24,880
All units, prepare for attack!

196
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,880
We won't be able
to hold off the droids for long.

197
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:31,840
You'll have to move quickly
to get your families out of danger.

198
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,060
Cham is still angry. He feels betrayed.

199
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,560
He counted on Republic assistance,
and it didn't come.

200
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,860
War turns promises into hopes.
I wish it wasn't so.

201
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,410
- Tell him.
- I will.

202
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:04,710
Captain Keeli, tell the pilots
to move the gunship into position.

203
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,250
This is Command.
Are all the charges in place?

204
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,550
Copy that. We're all ready.
The droid army is closing.

205
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,050
As soon as they are in range,
blow up the gunship.

206
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,520
There is a gunship blocking our way.
OM-5, OM-7, go check it out.

207
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:28,690
Roger, roger.

208
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:38,080
Careful. It might be full of clones.

209
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,580
No clones, just explosives.

210
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,080
Explosives?

211
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,380
Gotcha!

212
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,100
Halt, halt! We cannot get through.

213
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,730
We will have to find another way around.

214
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:27,250
Move those supplies into the transport
as soon as possible.

215
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,260
Repeat. The ships are ready to launch.

216
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,270
Uh, lookie, lookie!

217
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,150
Meesa proposing a conceptual work of art

218
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,450
to honor the ambassador
of Trade Federation.

219
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,950
Let's see, I'll take that one. Mmm-hmm.

220
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,110
Uh-oh.

221
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,460
Yeah, just give me... You done with that?
That's really good.

222
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,500
I heard Toydarians really like that,
but I'm taking it.

223
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,850
Thank you very much.
I'm sure you're finished with that.

224
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,170
Did you enjoy that? Did you like that one?
Well, I'll take it, thank you.

225
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:19,340
Uh...
Excuse me. Thank you. I'll take that.

226
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,020
Gentlemen and... gentlemen.

227
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,430
Here, let's try this one.

228
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,610
You thought I was going to drop...

229
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,790
I... Here we go!

230
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,820
Whoo!

231
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,420
Spinning. One, two, three! Ah!

232
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,670
Thank you very much.
That is conceptual art piece.

233
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,260
Thank you.

234
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:04,860
Meesa just sharing my Gungan art
with yousa and...

235
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:08,980
And meesa.

236
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,850
What are you looking at?

237
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,270
Meesa look at nothing.
No, no, no. Meesa look at nothing.

238
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,070
Meesa creating and sharing.

239
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,530
Gungan ritual-style art
with Trade Federation

240
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,120
to promote love and understanding.

241
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,170
Steady. Remember, we have to buy
as much time for the Twi'leks as possible.

242
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,470
Yes, sir.

243
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:45,050
For the Republic! For the Twi'leks!

244
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:37,110
- Captain Keeli!
- I'm not finished yet, sir.

245
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,450
We can do this, General.

246
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,110
Well, let's make the end memorable.

247
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,670
This is
Republic blockade runner 0-niner-niner.

248
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,460
We have broken through.

249
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,710
The Twi'leks will live
to fight another day.

250
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,140
The supplies have
arrived at the drop point.

251
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,990
It's food and medical supplies
from the Republic!

252
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,300
Safe journey, my friends.

253
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,550
I hope when we meet again,
it is under more pleasant circumstances.

254
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,840
Stop right there!

255
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,140
You look pale, Senator.

256
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,060
I have just received information

257
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,310
that a fleet of Republic ships has
penetrated the blockade around Ryloth.

258
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,150
If the Trade Federation
has proof of any treaty violation,

259
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:05,700
you are welcome to present it
to the full Senate.

260
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,660
It takes years for the Senate
to decide anything.

261
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,970
You play a dangerous game, Organa.
Next time, you will not get away with this.

262
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,890
The Republic has heart, my friend,

263
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,810
but I am not convinced
it has the strength to prevail.

264
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:37,270
However, after what I witnessed
here today,

265
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,740
perhaps it is time
I reconsidered our neutrality.

266
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,610
Tell the Jedi
I am open to meeting with them.

267
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,490
Master Yoda will be glad to hear it.

268
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:50,740
For now, at least,
the people of Ryloth shall endure.
