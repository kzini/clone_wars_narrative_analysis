1
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:19,280
Mystery on Bardotta!

2
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,700
An oasis of peace
during the Clone Wars.

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,790
The galaxy-wide conflict now threatens
the ancient ways

4
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,290
of the Bardottan people.

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,470
With their spiritual leaders
mysteriously vanishing,

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,810
the foundations of order in its system
are near collapse.

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,970
In desperation, the Queen of Bardotta
has called upon the Republic Senate

8
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,220
with a puzzling request, to help save
her people from certain doom.

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,140
I have humbly come before you
to ask for assistance

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,600
in our time of need, Chancellor.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,820
Queen Julia, the Republic is honored
that you have come to us for aid.

12
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,490
We are always happy to support
the neutral systems in a time of crisis.

13
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:02,990
If I may introduce
two of our best ambassadors...

14
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,580
With all due respect, Chancellor,

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,420
there is only one person
in the Republic I will meet with.

16
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,130
Representative Binks?

17
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,970
Why would the Queen of Bardotta
request the presence of Jar Jar Binks?

18
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,650
I'm afraid
she would not say,

19
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,600
but she impressed upon the Senate
the urgency of their situation.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,860
And what exactly is the trouble
on Bardotta?

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,610
Several of the ancient mystics,

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:35,820
the Dagoyan Masters,
have disappeared.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,660
A strong connection to the Force
the Dagoyan Masters have.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,040
Yet, unlike the Jedi or Sith they are.
Warriors, they are not.

25
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,540
Intuition, knowledge, the harmony
of the universe is what they sense.

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,920
Passively they connect with the Force.

27
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:59,300
I wonder why the Queen doesn't want
a Jedi sent to solve this mystery?

28
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,860
Long ago inducted into the Jedi Order
Bardottan children were.

29
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,850
However, thieves the Jedi
were named by the Dagoyan.

30
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,490
The Dagoyan Masters believed the Jedi
took the children against their will,

31
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,900
we were labeled as kidnappers.

32
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,280
Chancellor, am I to understand
the Queen requested.

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,150
Representative Binks
go alone to Bardotta?

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,450
I'm afraid she was quite specific
on that point.

35
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,490
I think that course of action is unwise.

36
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,040
If there is trouble on Bardotta,

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,250
I'm afraid Representative Binks will be
out of his depth.

38
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,350
I agree, which is why I came to you.

39
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,670
We await your decision.

40
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,590
Are you volunteering to undertake
this mission, Master Windu?

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
If the Council agrees, yes.

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,980
Do not touch anything.

43
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,570
Oh, Mesa not doin' nothin'.

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,700
Representative Binks,
I do not mean to be presumptuous,

45
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,450
but are you sure you are the delegate
the Queen spoke of?

46
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,330
Yup! The Queen is mesa pallo.
Mesa knowin' her for a longo time.

47
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,780
The Queen did not request
your presence, Jedi!

48
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,700
Your lightsaber please.

49
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,370
Mesa Representative Binks
of the Republic Senate

50
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,330
and hesa with mesa.

51
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,960
Representative Binks, you are an
honored guest of the Queen. Come!

52
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,620
Representative Binks of the Republic,
you were requested to come here alone,

53
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,080
why have you brought this Jedi
to Bardotta?

54
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,130
Oh, Great Queenie Julia,
please forgive mesa.

55
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,960
Disa Jedi is mesa pallo,

56
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,340
hesa comin' here to be helpin'
mesa solve your troubles.

57
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,560
He is your servant, then?

58
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:54,140
Umm...
Yes! Yes! Dat is the truth,

59
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,600
Masterin Mace is mesa humble servant.

60
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,400
Very well. Jedi, because
Jar Jar Binks vouches for you,

61
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,750
I will allow you to stay here.

62
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,280
For now, you must wait
in the antechamber.

63
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,420
Jar Jar, we are in danger.
An ancient prophecy is coming true.

64
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,460
Our beloved Dagoyan Masters
are disappearing one by one,

65
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,590
and if they are not returned,

66
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,970
a darkness will arise
that will engulf the galaxy.

67
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,890
Mesa not lettin' that happen, milady.

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,310
High Seneschal Peteen, I must speak
to Representative Binks alone.

69
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,000
It's been a long time, my love.

70
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,880
Come, meditate with me,
so our minds may be as one.

71
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,900
There is a great disturbance
in the Force here, that much is certain.

72
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,770
- I can sense it all around me.
- Hmm...

73
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,240
Difficult to see, such disdain
for the Jedi there is on Bardotta,

74
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,320
a good place for evil to hide it may be.

75
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:36,490
Yet remember, drifting within the flow
of the living Force,

76
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,330
the minds of the Dagoyan Masters are,

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,180
essential this connection is, whether
friend to the Jedi they be, or not.

78
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,776
Hmm. If you are looking for a friend
of the Bardottan's,

79
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,170
look no further than
Representative Binks.

80
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,590
The Queen has been alone with him
for quite some time now.

81
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,680
The innocence of a child
this Gungan has,

82
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:00,270
perhaps appealing
to the Dagoyan his mind is.

83
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,600
Well, my mind will be more at ease
if I knew what they've been up to.

84
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,980
I am here to see Representative Binks.

85
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:11,110
The Queen said no interruptions.

86
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,630
Jar Jar, I asked you here
because I trust you,

87
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,540
because I know you will be able
to help me in ways others cannot.

88
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:28,460
Mesa hopin' so, milady.

89
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,140
You will let me inside.

90
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,970
You should know better, Master Jedi.
That will not work on a Dagoyan.

91
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,240
I have discovered a terrible secret

92
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,330
buried within the rippling waves
of the Force.

93
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
Uh...

94
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,040
Maybe itsa best to get
Masterin Mace to hear this?

95
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,680
No, Jar Jar, only you. I must tell you,
I cannot trust the Jedi with this secret.

96
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,770
When the Dagoyan Masters
started disappearing,

97
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:28,100
I meditated to try and discover
their whereabouts,

98
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:32,440
but what I saw was shocking.
I stumbled upon a terrible plot.

99
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,770
- Excuse the intrusion, Your Majesty.

100
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,280
I will not excuse you, where are
the guards? Who told you to enter?

101
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,910
The guards had other business
to tend to.

102
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,540
We apologize, Your Majesty,
the Jedi slipped past us.

103
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,840
You see, Jar Jar,
these Jedi are deceptive, as I said!

104
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,630
Julia Queenie,
but yousa let mesa handle dis,

105
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,100
I promise da Jedi Masterin Mace
will besa no trouble for you.

106
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,900
Very well, Jar Jar,
take him out of my sight,

107
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,270
I will wait right here for you.

108
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Oh! Careful!

109
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,330
What do you think you're doing?
Where were you last night?

110
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,170
Doing? Mesa love da Queen Julia.
Whatsa wrong with dat?

111
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:31,500
You are jeopardizing the mission.

112
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,670
No, no, Masterin Jedi!

113
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,420
Mesa love for beautiful Julia
is da only thing startin' the talks.

114
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,510
Shesa trustin' only mesa.
Oh, and now yousa, a little.

115
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,470
You must understand, Jar Jar,

116
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,850
the Force is strangely
out of balance here.

117
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,730
Did the Queen
tell you anything important?

118
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,280
Dats what she was tryin' to do
before yousa come in all hot like.

119
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,950
Take this. Since they seem to want
to keep us separated,

120
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,110
contact me if you learn anything useful.

121
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,740
Okie-day, Masterin Mace,

122
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:05,250
but only if Queenie thinks
it's all right to tell you.

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,380
Masterin Mace, come quickly!

124
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,970
Shesa gone! Queenie is gone!

125
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,070
Calm yourself, Binks.

126
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,640
Disin bad, very, very bad!

127
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,190
She has disappeared. Like the other
Dagoyan Masters before her.

128
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:36,860
But it's not possible, no one could have
left this room without our knowing it.

129
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,070
I will convene
the Bahk-tov council, come!

130
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,670
Guards! Bahk-tov toil.

131
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
There can be no doubt!

132
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,600
The prophecy is being fulfilled,
as it was written.

133
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,150
First the Dagoyan Masters disappeared
and now the Queen.

134
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,400
If she does not return in three rotations,
I'm afraid she will be gone forever

135
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,570
and an era of Darkness
will rise throughout the galaxy.

136
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,700
Distinguished Council if I may...

137
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,250
The coming of the Jedi was a sign!

138
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,130
It was a sign! Harbinger of doom!
Harbinger of doom!

139
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:39,090
Council! Oh, great Bardotta Council.

140
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,920
Please, yousa must listen to mesa.

141
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,010
Queenie Julia was me bombad pallo
for many years.

142
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,390
Shesa knew there be troubles here.

143
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,640
Dats why she callin' mesa,
to helpin' in your time of need.

144
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,980
Mesa takin' my loyal helper
Masterin Mace,

145
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,740
and we findin' da Queenie
and bringin' her backin' to yousa!

146
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,330
Ask them the origin of the prophecy.

147
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,840
Now, let mesa askin' yousa
where dis prophecy comin' from?

148
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,090
They are the words
of the Frangawl clan,

149
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,760
who worshipped Malmourral,
the ancient demon of our faith.

150
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,510
Their ancient shrine is located
under our present-day Temple,

151
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:34,350
far beneath the surface.
It is a cursed place, an evil place,

152
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,560
no one who enters those caverns
ever returns.

153
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,610
Then that is where we must look first.

154
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:44,440
Den dats where we be goin' first!

155
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,170
Oh, boy, disin gonna be
bombad trouble, mesa knowin' it.

156
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:12,310
Um, uh, are yousa sure
disa the right way?

157
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:17,140
Yes, but ahead there is only darkness,
and evil.

158
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,810
Then yes, Jar Jar,
this is the correct path.

159
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,110
Okay. Mmm...

160
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,370
Here's your weapon Master Jedi.
Let us hope you do not have to use it.

161
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,830
The Frangawl ruled Bardotta
with an iron hand

162
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,250
for most of its early history.
They were warriors.

163
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,130
Some would call them barbarians,

164
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:48,260
but in fact they were men
and women of spirit.

165
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:55,850
Mesa no likin' this place, no way.

166
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,040
Look! A piece of the
Queenie Julia's headdress!

167
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,670
Oh, no! Mesa disappearin'!

Dagoyan Master of the Royal Council.

also have been disappeared
and brought here.

181
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,700
You'll never free yourself.

182
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,040
We are doomed to be sacrificed
to Malmourral.

183
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,960
This is bombad trouble.

184
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,970

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,470

Daba-boy-boy-ogans.

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:08,900

Mesa here to rescue yousa!

199
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:10,050
Jar Jar. They are stealing the Force.
They are stealing the Force within us.

200
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,260
Now shall
the demon of war,

201
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,350
Malmourral, be sated!

202
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,480
Now shall the Frangawl clan
steal your essence!

203
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,700

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,210

Blasphemer!

208
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,030
Uh, Mesa not big with the Force.
Yousa got the wrong Gungan.

209
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,240
The Force resides
within all living things.

210
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,000
What little you have will be ours.

211
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,330
Jar Jar!

212
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,830
Huh?

213
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,010
Get him!

214
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,270
Stay back. Mesa bombad warrior.

215
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,470
Get mesa outta here.

216
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,430
Look out!

Mesa need to
save the Queenie!

219
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,020
Go!

220
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:45,170
The demonic cult of
Malmourral is active once again.

221
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,010
If they steal the essence of the Queen,
darkness will fall across the stars.

222
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,770
Mesa no bombad warrior, but
mesa swearen to find yousa Queenie

223
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,860
with the help of mesa bombad pallo
Masterin Mace!

224
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,660

but you're starting to make sense to me!
