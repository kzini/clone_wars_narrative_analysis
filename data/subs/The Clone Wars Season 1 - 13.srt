1
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:20,610
<i>The Republic fleet is on the defensive
and pushed to the brink...</i>

2
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,410
<i>as war rages in the much-contested
Outer Rim territories.</i>

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:29,010
<i>Chaos and fear mount as the
Separatist army rages an epic battle</i>

4
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:31,530
<i>against heavily outnumbered
Republic ships.</i>

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:33,930
<i>In the far reaches of the Quell system,</i>

6
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,650
<i>Anakin Skywalker
and his padawan, Ahsoka,</i>

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>race across the galaxy
to aid Jedi knight Aayla Secura,</i>

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,570
<i>who is in the midst
of a fight for her life</i>

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,050
<i>as the sinister droid army closes in.</i>

10
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,010
Our shields are gone.

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,610
Hurry, Skywalker.
We're depending on you.

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,690
Prepare the gunships.

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,210
We have them now.

14
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,610
Send in the super droids.

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,250
Commander, get out there
and stop those droids.

16
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,330
I'm on it.

17
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,410
This way.

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,050
We're ready, Admiral.

19
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,850
- General, Skywalker's here.
- And none too soon.

20
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,370
We're entering the atmosphere.

21
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,290
Rocket droids incoming.

22
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,810
Those droids are boarding
Aayla's ship.

23
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,370
Take care of that flanker.
I'll be on board Aayla's cruiser.

24
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,730
Master, are you sure
that's the wisest thing...

25
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,650
- Hey, kid.
- I know, I know. I'm hanging on.

26
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,250
This is taking too long.

27
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,090
Destroy that cruiser.

28
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,610
But, sir, there are still
hundreds of droids on board.

29
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:04,050
I don't care.

30
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,650
Roger, roger.

31
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,090
Nice entrance, Skywalker.

32
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,770
How do you plan
to get us out of this mess?

33
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,530
Well, I have a ship docking
in the lower hanger as we speak.

34
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,130
- Activate docking port.
- On it.

35
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,730
Hold it.

36
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,090
We made it.

37
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,370
Gangway locked in, sir.

38
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,370
It's too late.

39
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,410
Master!

40
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,810
- Don't move the ship.
- Are you guys all right down there?

41
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,930
Ahsoka, we have to leave now.

42
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,330
Hurry. Get him on the ship.

43
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,010
I'm going to turn on
the deflector shields.

44
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,650
Gangway release.

45
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,690
<i>You'll never be able to dock with our ship
in the middle of this battle.</i>

46
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:55,410
We have no choice, Admiral.

47
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,610
General Skywalker's condition
may be critical.

48
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,570
We must get him
on board the Resolute.

49
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,330
<i>Are all Jedi so reckless?</i>

50
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,690
Just the good ones.

51
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,730
The hyperdrive's been activated.

52
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,090
- Shut it down.
- I can't.

53
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,170
- General Secura, what's going on?
- <i>We're going into hyperspace.</i>

54
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,250
- <i>Detach. Detach!</i>
- They'll take us with them.

55
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
Evasive maneuvers.

56
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,610
Plot every course
along their last known trajectory.

57
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,290
We need to finish this battle
and find them.

58
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:42,910
I need you with Commander Bly
up on the bridge right now.

59
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,350
I should stay.
Commander Bly doesn't need my help.

60
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:47,510
Anakin does.

61
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,230
You can help Anakin
by getting this ship to safety.

62
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,470
- General Secura, we have a problem.
- What is it, Commander?

63
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,030
In our haste to escape,
the navi-computer's coordinates

64
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,350
were inputted incorrectly, and,
well, we're headed right for a star.

65
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,750
It's no use. The navigation computer
is completely fried.

66
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,310
Shut down all power circuits
to reset the coordinates.

67
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,670
That will cut off
Anakin's life support.

68
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,470
I don't like it any more
than you do,

69
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,190
but it's a risk
we're going to have to take.

70
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,190
We're switching off
primary power units.

71
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,670
Cutting it awfully close.

72
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,510
Ready to shut off auxiliary power.

73
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,430
On three.

74
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,750
One, two,

75
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,870
three.

76
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,710
We're out of hyperspace.
Resume all power.

77
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,390
Switch the power back on.
What are you waiting for?

78
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,070
Hurry. Hurry!

79
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,190
We're not going to crash into the star,
but we're going to hit that planet.

80
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,510
Everyone out!

81
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,390
Well, we made it.

82
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:26,070
And Master Skywalker is still alive.

83
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:29,150
I'm just glad he wasn't awake
to see that landing.

84
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,350
He would have been proud.

85
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,630
I've certainly perfected
the art of demolishing ships

86
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,990
and almost getting my master killed.

87
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,870
Anakin doesn't have much time.
We have to find help tonight.

88
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,150
You and Bly go south.
Rex and I will stay here with Anakin.

89
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,430
No, Ahsoka.

90
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,390
In order to get help quickly,
we must work together.

91
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,070
I can't leave him.

92
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,710
Master, I know if I was hurt,
he'd never leave me behind.

93
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,910
I know this is hard, Ahsoka,

94
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,310
but Anakin has to stay behind,
and we have to go now.

95
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,350
There is nothing more
we can do for him.

96
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,030
We must do all we can
to get off this planet.

97
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,510
As a Jedi, it is your duty
to do what is best for the group.

98
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,830
General Secura, look.

99
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,550
We're not the only ones here
on this planet.

100
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,510
There has to be some kind
of something here.

101
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,990
If you don't mind me asking, General Secura,
where exactly are we going?

102
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:01,310
To go find the people
who live on this planet.

103
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,510
Where are we going to find them?
We have no idea where they are.

104
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,670
It seems to me
that the people we're looking for

105
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,910
live near giant trees.

106
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,590
Very perceptive, Padawan.

107
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,110
Be strong, Master,

108
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,350
just a little bit longer.

109
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,390
Rex will watch over you.

110
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,790
- It is time to go.
- Don't worry, kid.

111
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,910
I'll take good care of him.

112
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,070
Captain Rex, keep your locator on.
We should be back by daybreak

113
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,790
with whoever or whatever lives
on this planet.

114
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,470
Got it, General Secura.

115
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,790
Hey, kid. Good luck.

116
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,270
Come on, guys.
Let's move out.

117
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,190
I can still sense your worry for Anakin,
your attachment to him.

118
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,590
It's just...

119
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,070
I get so confused sometimes.

120
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,990
It's forbidden for Jedi
to form attachments,

121
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,470
yet we are supposed
to be compassionate.

122
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,190
It is nothing
to be ashamed of, Ahsoka.

123
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,470
I went through the same process
when I was your age with my own master.

124
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,830
Really?

125
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:12,950
You?

126
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,830
He was like a father to me.

127
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,190
I realized that for the greater good,
I had to let him go.

128
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,670
Don't lose a thousand lives
just to save one.

129
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,230
Maybe.

130
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,030
But that doesn't mean
that I can't try to save his life.

131
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,190
I don't see any signs of life.

132
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,070
Watch out!

133
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,390
No wonder it's deserted.

134
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,830
It's a death trap.

135
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,550
You'd have to be crazy
to want to dodge those on a daily basis.

136
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,710
It looks like someone or something
intelligent enough to figure out

137
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,150
a use for the pods
has dragged them away.

138
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,670
All we have to do is follow the trail.
Let's go.

139
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,710
General?

140
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,990
Are you all right?

141
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,070
Be...

142
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,750
Behind you.

143
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,110
What the...?

144
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,110
Watch your left!

145
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,070
Cameron's dead.

146
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,030
So are Lucky and Flesh.

147
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,710
We have to keep moving.

148
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,390
Pod central.
We made it.

149
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:21,150
Hello?

150
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,710
What have you come here for?

151
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,630
We are peacekeepers.
We are Jedi from the galactic Republic.

152
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:36,590
Our ship crashed a few miles away,
and one of us is very badly injured.

153
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,110
We need your help.

154
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,110
Violence breeds violence.
Jedi are no peacekeepers.

155
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,990
We're fighting for freedom.

156
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,350
And freedom and peace
require fear and death?

157
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,310
We colonized this system
to find solace from your wretched war.

158
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,670
We came here to find peace.

159
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,590
You must leave.

160
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,030
You will only destroy what small amount
of peace is left in the galaxy.

161
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,590
You will only bring
the destruction of us.

162
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,750
Regardless of the clone wars
and our part in them,

163
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,430
we still need your help.

164
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,790
I'm afraid I must do
what's best for my people.

165
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,310
We cannot help you.

166
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,550
Please.

167
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,790
Can you at least give us
some medical supplies?

168
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,950
My friend is dying.

169
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,390
I cannot ignore a plea for help.

170
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,630
I will send my son Wag Too
to help your friend.

171
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,950
He is a healer.
But only one Jedi may go with him.

172
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,510
The other must stay as insurance.

173
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,270
We wouldn't want
a surprise attack on our village

174
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:47,670
or the kidnapping
of our only healer.

175
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:49,950
Bly and I will stay.

176
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,270
Padawan,
go and help your master.

177
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,990
The clone and his blaster
cannot stay.

178
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,430
- He will go with the young one.
- I can handle it.

179
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,510
I don't need help.

180
00:16:59,511 --> 00:17:01,411
- Ahsoka.
- Don't worry.

181
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:04,030
Be mindful of your surroundings,
Padawan.

182
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,910
Those creatures are still out there.

183
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,350
Got it.

184
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,950
We won't be long.

185
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,910
Here. It will restore your energy.

186
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,510
Thank you.

187
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,990
I am sure you are aware that the Jedi
did not initiate the clone wars.

188
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,030
Our only intention is to end it
and restore peace to our galaxy.

189
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,110
What difference does it make
who started the war

190
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,110
and who only wants to end it?

191
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,230
No side is free of fault.
It takes two to fight.

192
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,790
But isn't liberty worth fighting for?

193
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,030
But is it worth killing for?

194
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,950
Fighting for something
doesn't necessarily mean

195
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,590
you have to destroy
everything in your path.

196
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,270
Only when you lay your arms down
and pursue a course of nonviolence

197
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,270
can you make this claim to me
that the Jedi are peacekeepers.

198
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,510
General, you need to
maintain your rest.

199
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,790
I can't rest.

200
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,710
Rex, they're coming.

201
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:42,550
I can hear them.

202
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,830
We must fight.

203
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,270
No, don't!

204
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,830
Fine.

205
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,950
Good work, little guy.

206
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,870
Master!

207
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,470
Good to see you, Snips.

208
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,950
This is Wag Too.
He's a healer.

209
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,030
- He can make you well again.
- Don't you worry.

210
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,070
I can fix you right up.

211
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,150
Snips?

212
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,030
The oil from the pods
will aid in the healing process.

213
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,230
Don't worry.
You'll be well in no time.

214
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,910
You were right all along,
Master Secura.

215
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
About what?

216
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,030
If I had stayed with Anakin,

217
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,630
we probably wouldn't have found
this village in time to save him.

218
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,750
At least
this whole ordeal is over now.

219
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,430
We still have to find
a way off this planet.

220
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,310
Well, I'm sure Admiral Yularen and
the Republic fleet are looking for us.

221
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,790
It shouldn't take them too long
to get here.
