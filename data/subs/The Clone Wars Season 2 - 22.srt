1
00:00:17,868 --> 00:00:19,828
Lethal trackdown!

2
00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:23,189
The young Boba Fett
has taken the law into his own hands

3
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:25,951
and made two attempts
on the life of Mace Windu,

4
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:28,832
the Jedi Master who killed his father.

5
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:34,073
Boba's mentor, bounty hunter Aurra Sing,
has taken three Republic officers hostage

6
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,996
in an effort to force Windu to face Boba
on their terms.

7
00:00:38,077 --> 00:00:41,637
A tactic that does not sit well
with the young vigilante.

8
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,524
This isn't what I wanted.

9
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:05,487
You don't have to do this.
You're not like them. I can tell.

10
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:09,889
- What do you know, old man?
- I know a good soldier when I see one.

11
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,730
I'm no soldier!
I'm no clone, not like those two!

12
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:18,372
- What? What are you looking at?
- Boba! What's going on?

13
00:01:19,053 --> 00:01:20,293
Nothing!

14
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,575
What are we going to do with them?

15
00:01:26,697 --> 00:01:30,577
Oh, I think our friends here
are about to finally prove useful.

16
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:51,787
So? What are you planning to do
with this son of Jango Fett?

17
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:54,228
I am not planning to do anything.

18
00:01:54,308 --> 00:01:57,269
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser
trying to get to you,

19
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,950
and you're just going to let it go?

20
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,311
Is there something else
I should be doing, Skywalker?

21
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:04,311
How about tracking him down?

22
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:08,554
So I should behave as this child does?
I should seek revenge?

23
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:13,956
No. How is it revenge if you stop this kid
and bring him to justice?

24
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:17,597
In case you hadn't noticed,
we are fighting a war.

25
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,918
We have a situation.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,640
We received a transmission
from the bounty hunters.

27
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:30,002
They apparently took hostages.

28
00:02:31,203 --> 00:02:33,844
Mace Windu, you were lucky to escape.

29
00:02:35,005 --> 00:02:37,405
Your friends here were not so fortunate.

30
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:41,047
Until you face Boba,
these men will be killed, one at a time.

31
00:02:41,927 --> 00:02:43,528
What's your name?

32
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,529
Name!

33
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:48,490
CT 4-11.

34
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:50,611
Pathetic. Boba, do it.

35
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:53,813
Boba!

36
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,774
That was Ponds.

37
00:02:59,415 --> 00:03:04,256
Only two to go, Windu.
Come and find us. We'll be waiting.

38
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:09,178
I'll go.
- I thought you had bigger concerns.

39
00:03:09,779 --> 00:03:12,660
That was before we knew
hostages were involved.

40
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,221
You are too injured to travel,

41
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:18,262
and your presence
would only aggravate the boy.

44
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:50,076
It should only be a matter of time
until they track us down.

45
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,078
Something on your mind, Castas?

46
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,479
Yeah, I got something to say.
We're in over our heads.

47
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,681
You signed on to kill Jedi.
Well, this is how it's done.

48
00:04:02,762 --> 00:04:06,282
You said the Separatists would pay well
if we killed Windu.

49
00:04:06,363 --> 00:04:10,924
That kid destroyed an entire cruiser,
and now we're taking hostages.

50
00:04:11,005 --> 00:04:13,205
That was not part of the plan.

51
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,846
I never took you for a coward, Castas.

52
00:04:15,927 --> 00:04:18,807
And what about you, Bossk?
You feel the same?

53
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,249
I'm still in. I got a lot riding on this kill,

54
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:25,051
and I need the cash.

55
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,372
Not me. I'm out.

56
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:31,052
Well then, you're in luck.
I was planning on making a stop.

57
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:34,214
You can drag your worthless carcass
off of this ship when we land.

58
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:37,495
- Where are we headed?
- We're going to visit an old friend.

59
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,737
Maybe he can replace Castas.

60
00:04:39,817 --> 00:04:41,737
Set course for Florrum.

61
00:04:55,263 --> 00:04:57,823
Master Plo, I don't understand.

62
00:04:57,904 --> 00:05:01,666
Shouldn't we be heading for the last place
we knew Boba Fett was spotted?

63
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:04,585
Why head to the one place
we know he is not?

64
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,152
Whoa!

65
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:24,875
The second bounty hunter
in the hologram is Aurra Sing.

66
00:05:24,996 --> 00:05:26,476
Another bounty hunter.

67
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:30,597
- Like his father, Jango Fett.
- Mmm. Yes.

68
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,719
It seems this boy found himself in the care
of at least one of Jango's associates.

69
00:05:37,681 --> 00:05:41,322
So we're looking for friends of Jango Fett,
or places where they hang out?

70
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:45,243
And to do that, we must go
to the lower levels.

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,604
The underworld.

72
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,692
Move along. Move along.

73
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:13,535
Move along. Move along.

74
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:17,537
Your pass, please.
Your pass, please.

75
00:06:18,457 --> 00:06:20,258
Your pass, please.

76
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,621
Your pass, please. Your pass, please.

77
00:06:28,062 --> 00:06:31,622
The data on Jango Fett suggested
he frequented this area.

78
00:06:32,263 --> 00:06:34,024
We must be cautious.

79
00:07:05,597 --> 00:07:11,199
- Come on, punch him! Yeah! Get him!
- Punch his teeth out! Yeah!

80
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:22,323
Oh, my dear, you never were good
at asking for permission to land.

81
00:07:22,364 --> 00:07:25,605
I never ask for permission
to do anything, my darling.

82
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:29,646
Yes!

83
00:07:29,727 --> 00:07:32,448
Yes, I remember.

84
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,010
Not mine, I take it?

85
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:42,051
No, part of my crew. He's Jango's son.

86
00:07:42,693 --> 00:07:45,373
Oh. Yes, yes.

87
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:50,976
Sorry about your father.
He was a friend, and an honorable man.

88
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:57,778
And that's Castas.
But he's getting off here.

89
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,220
Couldn't handle her, could you?
Well, don't be ashamed,

90
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:07,702
you're not the first man to bail out
from under her command.

91
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,823
He's speaking from experience.

92
00:08:11,185 --> 00:08:12,824
Oh!

93
00:08:12,906 --> 00:08:15,025
Oh, you're a dangerous woman.

94
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:17,306
Yes, very dangerous.

95
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,867
Come, come, come! Let us go inside,

96
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:23,948
where we can discuss business
over a drink like civilized people.

97
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,079
I'm stuck out here on Florrum.

98
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,720
I warned you.
Working with Aurra Sing is bad business.

99
00:08:52,162 --> 00:08:57,323
Yeah. This job's gone south,
like every job I do with that hag.

100
00:09:04,927 --> 00:09:06,206
No, Boba.

101
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:13,730
I hear there's a downed
Republic cruiser on Vanqor.

102
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:17,412
- Your handiwork?
- I wouldn't take credit for that, no.

103
00:09:19,013 --> 00:09:22,173
We saw it, though.
Crawling with Republic troops.

104
00:09:22,695 --> 00:09:25,175
I wouldn't try and salvage it for a while
if I were you.

105
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,975
I appreciate the advice.

106
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:32,577
So, Boba, what is it like
working with Aurra?

107
00:09:32,658 --> 00:09:34,258
It's all right.
It must be...

108
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:37,020
I have some information.

109
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,581
Information that's worth something
to the right people.

110
00:09:41,062 --> 00:09:45,222
- Really? What kind of people?
- That's where you come in.

111
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:48,104
Remember, Aurra?
That job we pulled?

112
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,185
Hmm? Oh, yes.

113
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:51,505
Excuse me.

114
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,906
- Castas!
- Huh?

115
00:10:01,911 --> 00:10:05,551
Hey! Hey!
Someone scrape that guy off the floor.

116
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:07,512
He sprung a leak.

117
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:24,079
Well, I hope we have better luck here.

118
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,000
This is the fifth scum-bucket drinking hole
we've been to.

119
00:10:28,082 --> 00:10:32,642
Yes. And this time, try to be more subtle.

120
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,283
What do you mean?

121
00:10:35,365 --> 00:10:38,565
You've adopted
many of your master's ways,

122
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:42,406
including a lack of subtlety.

123
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,448
Sorry, Master Plo.

124
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:50,530
Just try to blend in. Listen.

125
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:55,533
You may be surprised what people reveal
when they have been drinking.

126
00:11:07,658 --> 00:11:09,258
Have a look around.

127
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:21,583
- I need some information.
- We're not selling that here, pal.

128
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:26,985
It's been a while
since we had one of you down here.

129
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:30,986
Aren't you a bit busy with your war
to be bothering with the likes of us?

130
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:34,948
We are never too busy
for the citizens of the Republic.

131
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:41,831
I'm not getting anywhere.

132
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:45,273
Okay, try to relax.

133
00:11:47,994 --> 00:11:51,595
Like Master Plo says, I'm listening.

134
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:53,996
Listening...

135
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:59,199
This war is killing me.
My whole business has gone under.

136
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,200
Oh. Give me another round.

137
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,242
I saw her last night, on the video screen.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

138
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:13,084
- I'm gonna ask her out.
- She'll never go out with you.

139
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:16,125
She's gonna go out with me!

140
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:20,247
Florrum? A buddy of mine
was just murdered on Florrum.

141
00:12:20,328 --> 00:12:21,848
Murder?

142
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:27,090
Yeah, yeah, he was working a big job.
At least, that is what he said.

143
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:32,252
He was telling me he had some
valuable information on a holotransmitter,

144
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:37,374
and then, boom, she shot him.
It must have been some good dirt.

145
00:12:38,296 --> 00:12:42,295
What's her name?
Hope it's not who I think it is.

146
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,698
He was working with Aurra Sing.
She is bad news.

147
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,020
That's her, all right.
She's the boss's ex.

148
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:53,461
There's always trouble
when she shows up.

149
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:55,862
Yeah, that's the one.

150
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:59,903
Find something interesting, kid?

151
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,785
What's this? What are you reaching for?

152
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:11,108
- Stand down!
- You can't take us all, Jedi.

153
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:15,550
Would you like to try
and prove your theory?

154
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:19,511
Hey, nobody's shooting up my place today!

155
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:21,672
He's right.

156
00:13:22,754 --> 00:13:25,755
- Drinks on the house.
Now wait a minute!

157
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,397
Not very subtle.

158
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,999
- I was being subtle.
- Interesting result.

159
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,521
But, Master, you were right.
I heard about a murder.

160
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:43,482
A murder Aurra Sing recently committed.

161
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,683
- Where?
- Florrum.

162
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,364
Well done, little Ahsoka.

163
00:13:48,925 --> 00:13:50,964
We're off to Florrum.

164
00:13:56,928 --> 00:14:01,929
Well, my dear, you are in
an interesting predicament once again.

165
00:14:03,491 --> 00:14:07,011
Getting involved with the Jedi
is never a good idea.

166
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:12,614
Aurra, we've got an incoming ship.
Jedi, by the look of it.

167
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:15,695
- Windu!
- Finally. Took them long enough.

168
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:19,657
Move Slave I to the outskirts
and get the hostages ready.

169
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,257
Right.

170
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:24,018
So, are you in or not?

171
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,141
I will not help you.
But I will not hinder you, either.

172
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,982
This is your fight, not mine.

173
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:10,278
Hello, hello,
and welcome to Florrum.

174
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,679
I should assume
you are walking us into a trap.

175
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,721
Yes, you should.
They're waiting inside the bar.

176
00:15:18,562 --> 00:15:21,442
I have no idea
what she has planned for you.

177
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,403
And the reason you're telling us is?

178
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:28,286
So you know
that I am not involved in this.

179
00:15:29,326 --> 00:15:32,446
Remember, patience.

180
00:15:45,974 --> 00:15:48,654
Bad move, Jedi. This will cost you.

181
00:15:50,255 --> 00:15:53,456
I wanted Windu. What are you doing here?

182
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:56,897
We can do this the difficult way,
or the simple way.

183
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,739
The choice is yours.

184
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:03,300
- Bossk, can you hear me?
- Roger.

185
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:05,701
Execute the hostages if I give the word.

186
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:10,503
Unwise. You have already lost,
and you don't even know it.

187
00:16:11,224 --> 00:16:15,465
I am prepared to kill you, the hostages,
whatever it takes

188
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:20,107
- to get what Boba wants.
Sounds more like what you want.

189
00:16:23,429 --> 00:16:24,468
Don't.

190
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,071
Aurra? Aurra!

191
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:35,952
Bad news, boys.
If I don't hear from her soon, I'm gone,

192
00:16:36,314 --> 00:16:38,194
and you're both fried.

193
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:43,636
- Let her go!
- No chance.

194
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,517
She won't do it, Boba. She's not like you.

195
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:50,799
- She's right. I'm not a murderer.
- I'm not a murderer!

196
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,722
- But I want justice.
- We are justice.

197
00:16:55,922 --> 00:16:57,723
Don't listen to them.

198
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:01,124
No one will be harmed if you come quietly.

199
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,726
- I can't let you die.
- You won't have to.

200
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,409
Aurra!

201
00:17:23,413 --> 00:17:25,613
It's over. Surrender!

202
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:27,614
Aurra! Now!

203
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:29,736
Bomb!

204
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:34,937
Boba, hurry!

205
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:39,020
Aurra, help! Help me!

206
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:46,863
Don't leave me! No!

207
00:17:48,064 --> 00:17:50,264
The hostages, where are they?

208
00:17:50,865 --> 00:17:54,865
Boba, if you do not tell us where
those men are, they are going to die!

209
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:57,706
- Innocent men!
- She left me.

210
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:24,077
He will not reveal
the location of the hostages.

211
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,839
I thought you might talk
some sense into him.

212
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:31,121
Tell the Jedi
what he wants to know, Boba.

213
00:18:32,562 --> 00:18:35,123
Why should I help anybody?
I've got no one!

214
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:38,804
It is the honorable thing to do.

215
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:42,366
It's what your father would have wanted.

216
00:19:04,135 --> 00:19:08,096
Ahsoka, she's trying to lead you
away from the hostages.

217
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:10,618
Go to coordinates 1-5-7-9.

218
00:19:20,902 --> 00:19:22,502
Time's up.

219
00:19:29,347 --> 00:19:30,345
Don't move.

220
00:20:11,363 --> 00:20:12,523
No! No!

221
00:20:35,213 --> 00:20:37,613
I see now I've done terrible things.

222
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,135
But you started
when you murdered my father.

223
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:43,336
- I'll never forgive you.
- Mmm.

224
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:47,617
Well, you're going to have to.

225
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,217
Take him away.
