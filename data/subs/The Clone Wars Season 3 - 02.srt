1
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,120
Separatist attack!

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,290
After the destruction
of the Republic outpost on the Rishi moon,

3
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,540
General Grievous and Asajj Ventress
plan an attack on the planet Kamino,

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,630
home of the cloning factories.

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,960
Meanwhile, aboard a Jedi cruiser,

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,960
Jedi Knights Anakin Skywalker
and Obi-Wan Kenobi

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,550
examine an intercepted message
from General Grievous.

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,970
We are decrypting the audio, sir.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,430
The clone planet of Kamino
will be a dangerous target.

10
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,640
Just make sure you hold up
your half of the mission.

11
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,730
We must stop the production of new clones

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,860
if we are to win this war.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,610
Kamino.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,950
They're going to attack our home planet.

15
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,080
The Separatists are taking
quite the chance even considering this.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,410
With all due respect, General,
if someone comes to our home,

17
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,830
they better be carrying a big blaster.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,800
I concur with Captain Rex, sir.
This is personal for us clones.

19
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,850
We'll make sure Kamino is secure.

20
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:18,180
Tell your troopers in the 501st
they're going home.

21
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,340
Yes, sir!

22
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,900
All is ready, General.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,730
Good. We will attack Tipoca City first.

24
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:37,990
I have the exact locations of both
the clone DNA room

25
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,860
and the clone trooper barracks.

26
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,240
Both shall be annihilated under my hand.

27
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,370
Our hands, General.
Count Dooku assigned us both this task.

28
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,920
But of course, assassin.
I look forward to meeting you.

29
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,550
Are the aqua droids prepared
for phase two of the plan?

30
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,760
Yes mistress.

31
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,460
Masters Kenobi and Skywalker.

32
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,460
Welcome to Kamino.

33
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,250
Greetings, Generals.

34
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,630
I wish our arrival
wasn't under such circumstances.

35
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,180
We believe Grievous is planning
a Separatist attack on Kamino.

36
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:48,100
But the Republic blockade
is far too strong. They would not dare.

37
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Look around, Fives.
Feels like yesterday we were here.

38
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,730
Heading to target practice.

39
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,610
Remember that?

40
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,610
Do I ever.

41
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,370
Hey, 99!

42
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,450
Echo! Fives!

43
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,660
You actually remember us?

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,500
I remember all my brothers.

45
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,630
Is Hevy here? Where's he?

46
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,220
There was an incident
on the Rishi moon outpost.

47
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,050
He saved our lives, but he gave up his own.

48
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,890
Oh.

49
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,220
I... I see.

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
Hevy gave you his medal?

51
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:36,980
So why have you returned to Kamino?

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,190
The Generals received word
of an impending attack here.

53
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,200
Well, how can I help?

54
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,370
Attack formation Echo-3.

55
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,040
- Status.
- Deflector shields raised.

56
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:02,720
- Destroyers in position.
- Forward cannons ready.

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,180
Landing craft prepared.

58
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,350
All ships are in position.

59
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,430
Commence attack!

60
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,860
The Separatist fleet
is pressing their attack, sir.

61
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,860
Contact command at Tipoca City.

62
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,670
Shore up our defenses.

63
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,710
The fleet is not as large as I expected.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,920
Begin the air strike.

65
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,140
Good to see you, General.
Ready to have some fun?

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,890
You know me, Broadside.

67
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,270
I'd rather be up here
than stuck in a command center.

68
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,800
Warning! Falling Debris.

69
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,800
Grievous appears to be
sacrificing his transports

70
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
in favor of protecting his command ship.

71
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,050
Something's not right.

72
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,950
Reinforcements have arrived.

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,570
Send out the aqua droids
to assemble the assault craft.

74
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,590
Focus on the cruisers!

75
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm going to press the attack, Master.

76
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,010
No, Anakin. Wait! It's too easy.

77
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,350
Not even Grievous
would attack so recklessly.

78
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,890
Master, the battle's up here in space,
not down there.

79
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,560
The debris from the destroyed
Separatist ships is the key.

80
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,310
What are you thinking?

81
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,440
I think I'd like to go for a swim.

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,210
Nothing as of yet.

83
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:45,210
Only you could be worried about the ships
I already shot down.

84
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,520
Wait a minute!

85
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,600
Aqua droids! It looks as though
they're assembling assault craft.

86
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,610
Anakin, I was right!

87
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,860
Those downed transports were hiding
ships for an underwater assault.

88
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,240
Anakin, come in!

89
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,200
Hold it right there! Do not move!

90
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,790
Thanks for the lift, friend.

91
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:09,420
Anakin, the city is under attack!
I need you down here now!

92
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,800
On my way!

93
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,270
Sir, you sent for us?

94
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,600
It's a dangerous assignment,

95
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,450
but I want you two up on the bridge
in sniper positions.

96
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,020
Yes, sir, we're on it!

97
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,630
Watch out!

98
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,360
Kill them all!

99
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,120
99, get out of here!

100
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,150
This is no place for you.

101
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,250
There aren't enough droids here
to capture the city.

102
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,170
They're trying to distract us.

103
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,460
Go protect the DNA chamber,
I'll deal with Grievous.

104
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,590
Got it.

105
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,980
Fives, keep firing! We can beat these guys!

106
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,740
- 99!
- I... I brought you some ammo.

107
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,966
Is there a better spot than this?
A better defensive position we can take?

108
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,110
Droids! Behind us!

109
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,280
The grenades!

110
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Thanks, 99. Good job!

111
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,920
Look out, there's more!

112
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:58,050
Cadets! What are you doing here?

113
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,760
We got separated from our group.

114
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,260
- Where were they taking you?
- The barracks.

115
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,180
Oh. I know the best way there!

116
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,140
Keep firing! No mercy!

117
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,010
Your skills are impressive.

118
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,510
Perhaps a match for my own, assassin.

119
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,970
Count Dooku may have taught you
how to swing a lightsaber, General,

120
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:52,890
but that hardly makes you my equal.

121
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,650
And yet I am the General
in charge of this assault.

122
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,150
Remember, assassin,
you are to recover the clone DNA.

123
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,490
Why not just destroy it?

124
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,660
Because the DNA could unlock
new possibilities for us.

125
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,030
Keep playing with your droids.

126
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,910
I'll handle breaking into the DNA room.

127
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Shall I provide you with a droid escort?

128
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,920
My dear General,

129
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,060
there's nothing you have that I could want.

130
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,610
What are we going to do?

131
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,860
A Separatist victory means death.
For all of us.

132
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,030
The cadet is right,
what are we going to do?

133
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,250
We fight.

134
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,870
But our training's not finished.

135
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:57,540
Look around, we're one and the same.
Same heart, same blood.

136
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,210
Your training is in your blood.

137
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,250
And my blood's boiling for a fight.

138
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,550
This is our home. This is our war.

139
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,220
What about weapons?

140
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,090
The armory.

141
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,610
Just a few corridors away,
here in the barracks.

142
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,520
I can retrieve
all the firepower that we need.

143
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,860
So, who wants to blast some droids?

144
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,500
The droids are spread thin.
We must press our offensive now.

145
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,580
I was beginning to think
my presence went unnoticed.

146
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,090
You weren't planning on leaving
without saying hello, were you?

147
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,250
Here it is. Everything we need is here.

148
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,960
Excellent work, 99.

149
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:25,210
Hurry up, the droids have almost
reached the barracks.

150
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,470
Let's get into position.

151
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,430
Open up.

152
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,890
Get those doors open and scare
the remaining clones out of hiding.

153
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:38,470
Roger, roger.

154
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,690
Blast them!

155
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,150
All too easy.

156
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,660
Define easy, General.

157
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,450
Kenobi!

158
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,960
Kenobi, Kamino has fallen.
Your clone army is doomed.

159
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,170
I beg to differ, Grievous.

160
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,490
Cadets, now!

161
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,500
Last one, Commander! Make it count!

162
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,420
I'll get more!

163
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,250
99, you can't!

164
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm a soldier. Like you.

165
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,170
This is what I was bred for.

166
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:21,300
99! No!

167
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,900
Commander Cody!

168
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,070
Yes, sir!

169
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,420
The droids have been pushed back
to the main hangar.

170
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,460
We've got to stop meeting like this,
my friend.

171
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,430
Move it, troopers, on the double!

172
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,640
Fire!

173
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,740
Look! It's the General.

174
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,890
I suppose you expect me to surrender.

175
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,730
Actually, I plan to let the clones
execute you right now.

176
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,650
Not this time.

177
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,700
We did it. We held them back!

178
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,250
We lost a true soldier.

179
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,750
He really was one of us.

180
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,640
Echo, Fives.

181
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,300
You both really stepped up
in the heat of battle.

182
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,280
We did what we had to do, sir.

183
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,520
What any clone would've done.

184
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,560
Both of you showed valor out there,
real courage.

185
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,820
Reminded me of me, actually.

186
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:26,320
Echo, Fives, you're both officially
being made ARC Troopers.

187
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,700
I don't think the Separatists
will be coming back here anytime soon.

188
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,330
But if they do,

189
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,540
Kamino will be lucky
to have clones like you defending it.

190
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,380
Good job, men.
