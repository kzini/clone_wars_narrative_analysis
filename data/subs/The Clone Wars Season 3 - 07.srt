1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,950
Criminals captured!

2
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,960
Jedi Master Plo Koon
and Padawan Ahsoka Tano

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,960
successfully thwarted an attempt
on Mace Windu's life,

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,380
killing bounty hunter Aurra Sing
in the process.

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,050
Since that time, young Ahsoka
has grown strong in the ways of the Force.

6
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,720
Now, after several harrowing adventures
alongside her master,

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,810
the two Jedi have returned to the Temple
on Coruscant to receive their next mission.

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,810
Welcome, Padawan.
In order, congratulations are.

9
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,610
Shown your courage and strength
yet again, you have.

10
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:53,280
Job well done, Ahsoka.

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,610
And now, on to more pressing matters.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,160
To Balith, you must go, Skywalker.

13
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,000
There's a large-scale civil war on Balith.
They have requested our assistance.

14
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,170
Anakin, you will leave immediately
to command the third legion.

15
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:09,630
I've never been to Balith.

16
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,750
You will stay here, Padawan,
we need your full report.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,010
As you wish.

18
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:25,180
Ahsoka, I sense you are uneasy. What is it?

19
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,270
Oh...

20
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,980
I... Nothing.

21
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,700
Master, let me come with you.

22
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,530
If I'm not with you,
who else will have your back?

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,530
Stay here, finish your studies,
get some rest.

24
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,700
You've said it yourself. I learn more
in the field than I ever do here.

25
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,290
Well, think of this
as a chance to prove me wrong.

26
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,880
And stay out of trouble.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,940
She will die,
and there's nothing that you can do.

28
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,750
Enter.

29
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,750
Have a seat, young Padawan.

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,510
Troubled you are, Padawan?

31
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:43,430
Yes, Master Yoda,
I've been having dreams.

32
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,930
Hmm.

33
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,720
Dreams, you say?

34
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,230
Yes, dreams... Or visions.

35
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,230
I don't know, but they're so real.

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,230
Premonitions. Telling you something,
they are.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,110
I know I reported otherwise,
but I believe that Aurra Sing isn't dead.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,240
She's still alive, and she's preparing
to kill someone close to me.

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,210
So, you begin to see
the true power of the Force.

40
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,420
Visions, they are.
Underestimate them, you must not.

41
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,920
Meditate. To see clearly,
more experience you need.

42
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,810
These should help you
with your studies, dear.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,990
Study! I should be out there fighting!
Not in here studying.

44
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,450
- Kill her.
- With pleasure.

45
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,710
Senator Amidala is in danger.

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,800
Senator, Padawan Ahsoka Tano
is here to see you.

47
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,180
Senator Amidala.

48
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,930
Ahsoka, it's so good to see you.
How have you been?

49
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,560
Honestly? I've been better.

50
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,270
I'm worried for you, Senator.
I sense you are in grave danger.

51
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,690
What makes you believe that?

52
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,030
I've been having dreams. Bad dreams.

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,710
Padmé, I know you're in danger.
I just know it.

54
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,300
What kind of danger?

55
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,420
I believe that a very dangerous
bounty hunter is out to assassinate you.

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
This is troubling.

57
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,960
Captain, please take
all necessary precautions.

58
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,800
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,100
Bail Organa and I are leading a conference
concerning the refugees from the war.

60
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,890
I leave for Alderaan in the morning.

61
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:53,930
But the threat to your life!

62
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,770
Ahsoka, the refugee situation
is much too crucial to ignore.

63
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,330
I called this conference. It could make
an enormous difference in policy.

64
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,900
It's vital that I go.

65
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,990
Yes, Senator.

66
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,680
I am sure now that it is Senator Amidala
who is in danger.

67
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,310
Senator Amidala, you say?

68
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,480
Yes, Master. I've seen it in my visions.

69
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,030
Choose, you must,
how to respond to your visions.

70
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,070
But remember,
always in motion is the future

71
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,410
and many possible futures there are.

72
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,410
Yes, Master.

73
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,500
Senator!

74
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,750
Ahsoka, what is it?

75
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,930
I can't just stay behind
knowing about the threat to your life.

76
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,970
Allow me to come with you, please.

77
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,430
I suppose it couldn't hurt.

78
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,570
Besides, I enjoy your company.

79
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:23,570
Of course you can join me,
as extra security.

80
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,610
Thank you, Padmé.

81
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:58,060
You'll learn to play in time, Ahsoka.
Someday you'll even beat me.

82
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,600
It's not that.

83
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,350
What's on your mind?

84
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,940
I've been mostly unsure about my abilities
on my own.

85
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,610
Usually, Master Skywalker is there
to guide me.

86
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,030
When I was Queen, I felt
the same insecurities as you do now.

87
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,740
I had my advisors, but it was ultimately
up to me to run the entire Naboo system,

88
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,750
and I was very afraid at times.

89
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,640
Really? You felt unsure?

90
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:33,220
Oh, yes, but I have learned
to trust in myself, and you will, too.

91
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,390
Thank you.

92
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,560
- One more game?
- Absolutely.

93
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,950
It's begun.

94
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,460
Padmé!

95
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,080
The assassin's inside!

96
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,090
Ahsoka!

97
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,670
Stay down!

98
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,090
What's going on?

99
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,390
Nothing.

100
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,230
False alarm. Forgive me, Senator.

101
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,480
Are you all right, my lady?

102
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,940
Yes, Captain, I'm fine.

103
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,470
- Padmé.
- Bail, it's so good to see you.

104
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,860
Thank you so much
for hosting this conference.

105
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:05,600
Dealing with the refugees of this war
needs to be our number one priority.

106
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,690
Absolutely! Your presence here
is greatly appreciated.

107
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,650
Come. Senator Mothma and I
will take you to your quarters.

108
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,990
Senator, might I have a word
with you in private?

109
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,490
Of course, Padawan Tano.

110
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,200
If you'll excuse me.

111
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,870
I know I made a mistake last night,

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,710
but that doesn't mean
the threat to you is any less.

113
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,880
I haven't lost faith in you, Ahsoka.

114
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,170
I know, and I appreciate that.

115
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,670
I don't mean to interject,
but now is not the time for this.

116
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,050
Senator Amidala must prepare
for her summit.

117
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,350
But I believe the attempt on your life
is going to happen tonight.

118
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,600
Why tonight?

119
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,560
I had another vision
and it was much clearer.

120
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,900
I could see more than usual,
even a location.

121
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,190
It was a large room,
you were giving a speech.

122
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,230
This room,
could you recognize it if you saw it?

123
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,030
Yes, I think I could.

124
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,250
So, does anything look familiar?

125
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,630
Yes, this is it.
This is the place I saw in my vision.

126
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,420
Where would the assassin be?

127
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,100
That's the part I'm not sure of.

128
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:04,930
We are taking all the necessary
precautions, correct, Captain?

129
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,150
Yes, my lady.

130
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,060
But Aurra Sing will know
what you plan to do. She'll find a way in.

131
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,440
Ahsoka, in your vision,
does Aurra succeed?

132
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,770
I... I can't tell.

133
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,610
Well, then,
at least we have a fighting chance.

134
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,620
Isn't it just beautiful?

135
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,830
Yes, but I really must insist
you go back inside.

136
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,790
It's not safe for you out here.

137
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,790
Ahsoka, I can't stop living my life.

138
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,470
You forget, I'm a friend of the Jedi.
I'm no stranger to taking risks.

139
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,810
- What is it?
- I'm confused.

140
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,600
My visions are telling me one thing,
but reality is telling me another.

141
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,860
I don't know which to believe anymore!

142
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe no one's out to kill you.

143
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,830
As the conflict that
divides our galaxy escalates,

144
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,000
we cannot lose perspective on
the value of life and the price of freedom.

145
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,880
No one knows this truth more

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,670
than the distinguished senator,
Padmé Amidala of Naboo.

147
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,510
Thank you, Senator Organa.

148
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,970
I wanted to first thank you all for coming.

149
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,760
This is a cause
that is very important to me.

150
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,980
I can remember, after the illegal blockade
of my home world Naboo

151
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,860
by the Trade Federation,
how many lives were thrown into chaos.

152
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:43,440
True, in the grand scale of things,
it was a small conflict.

153
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,360
And true, there was only one battle
fought during the occupation,

154
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,950
but let us examine the cost
of that one conflict.

155
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,700
Hundreds of Naboo
were forced from their homes,

156
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:58,040
Naboo security forces
and the Gungan army

157
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,880
both incurred heavy casualties,

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,510
and the life of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn
was lost.

159
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:09,340
And yet, now I find myself a party to
and witness of a full-scale war

160
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,140
that has divided our great republic in two.

161
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,810
Already more than 100 Jedi...

162
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,750
Get a medical droid! We need a medic!

163
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,900
The Senator will be fine.
It was only a flesh wound.

164
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,560
Padmé, I'm sorry.

165
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,320
For what, Ahsoka? You did all you could.

166
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,070
- Did you find the assassin?
- She ran off before I could get her.

167
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,480
- She?
- Yes, she.

168
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,900
I am positive now that it is Aurra Sing
who is out to get you.

169
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,280
Please return to Coruscant immediately,
for your own safety.

170
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:17,080
Padmé, I agree with the Padawan.

171
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,870
It is far too dangerous for you
to give your speech tonight.

172
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,590
If someone wants me dead,
they will follow me wherever I go.

173
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,380
But you know my visions are all mixed up.

174
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:30,310
What if what I saw was the attempt
that just happened?

175
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,690
Padmé, I am not willing
to gamble with your life.

176
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,010
Wait a minute.

177
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,180
I think I have a way we can get around
putting you in jeopardy

178
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:40,940
and have you attend the conference.

179
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,780
All clear, sir.

180
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,950
The upper levels are cleared, Captain.

181
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,410
Sweep complete. The area is secure.

182
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,920
Fear, in these times,
it is the greatest weapon wielded

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,130
against those who would stand up
for truth and justice.

184
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,380
We have a responsibility as the
elected representatives of the Republic

185
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,720
to face our fears and challenge those
who threaten the safety of its people.

186
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,770
I stand before you today bruised,
but not beaten.

187
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,280
The voices of the people shall be heard,

188
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,860
and together we shall represent them.

189
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,636
The homeless shall no longer
be homeless and faceless.

190
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,546
- Aurra's not here.
- What do you mean, she's not here?

191
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,490
The soldiers who so valiantly fight
to protect us

192
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,700
must also be protected
once their job is done.

193
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,080
She's not in this room.

194
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,590
We need legislation to defend
the displaced from slavery,

195
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,290
to protect our soldiers from feeling

196
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,250
as if there is no future
beyond their warfare,

197
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,670
and we must open channels
though diplomacy

198
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,340
so that we can end this war.

199
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,680
I know there are those among the
Separatists who would end this conflict,

200
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,940
and I know there are those individuals
in the galaxy

201
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,690
who would seek to promote fear
and spread chaos.

202
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,270
To those that act as agents of chaos,
I say this.

203
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,360
I stand resolute and unyielding.

204
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,360
And if you strike my voice down,

205
00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,450
know that a chorus of thousands
shall rise up in its place.

206
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,330
For you have no dominion
over the righteous.

207
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:09,130
We are the defenders of truth.

208
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,140
You! I remember you, Jedi brat!

209
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:29,310
Stand down, assassin!

210
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,160
You left me for dead!

211
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,320
Luckily, Hondo pulled me out
of the wreckage.

212
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Surprised you're back to work so soon.

213
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:38,150
Well, a girl's got to make a living.

214
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,490
Get this door open, now!

215
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
Why are you doing this?
Killing me will not stop the relief effort.

216
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,840
Honey, this isn't about your cause.
This is about revenge.

217
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,340
My employer wants to get even with you,
simple as that.

218
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,260
Who hired you?

219
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:06,520
Enough talk!
Time to see what you're made of, kid.

220
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,530
No!

221
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,360
- Ahsoka!
- Nice shot.

222
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,200
I told you,
I'm no stranger to taking risks.

223
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:30,410
- Senator!
- Captain, she's stunned.

224
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:07,910
Are you all right?

225
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,920
Without Ahsoka's foresight, I fear things
would have gone quite differently.

226
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,040
Serve you well, your visions have,
young Padawan.

227
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,710
Thank you, Master Yoda.

228
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,930
But we still don't know
who's really behind this.

229
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,140
Hmm. Concentrate, remember.
What do you see?

230
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,060
I see shapes.

231
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,740
Large, devouring...

232
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,110
I hear laughter.

233
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,330
Bizarre laughter.

234
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,620
And purple? I see a color, purple.

235
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:00,130
I don't know what it means,
none of it is familiar to me.

236
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,050
It is to me.

237
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,800
I've been thinking, Aurra Sing said
the person who hired her

238
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,760
simply wanted revenge
for something I did to them.

239
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,600
Well, that could be a lot of people.

240
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,400
Yes, but with Ahsoka's added details,
I know someone who fits the description.

241
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Ziro.

242
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,330
Oh.

243
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,250
You must be Anakin Skywalker.

244
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Have you met my Padawan, Ahsoka Tano?

245
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,170
Padawan.

246
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,350
I believe you have a grudge
against Senator Amidala.

247
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,810
And what makes you say something
so utterly ridiculous, youngling?

248
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,150
It's because of Senator Amidala
you're locked up in this place.

249
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,780
The bounty hunter Aurra Sing
attempted to kill the Senator.

250
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,860
I believe you hired her for the job.

251
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,030
I did no such thing!

252
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,200
We have Aurra Sing in custody.
She told us everything.

253
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:16,960
But... What? She told you...
She told you what? Impossible.

254
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,210
I should have hired someone better.

255
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,290
Oh.

256
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:27,170
You just guaranteed yourself an extra-long
vacation in this lovely establishment.

257
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,720
Do you see the conditions I'm living in?

258
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,680
That... That insipid
senator put me in here!

259
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:41,360
She deserves to die for leaving me
to rot in this squalor!

260
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,860
Well, thanks to you, Ziro,
and that little confession,

261
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,450
you've just officially failed.

262
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,410
You'll never get away with this!

263
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,660
You have no idea what I'm capable of!
