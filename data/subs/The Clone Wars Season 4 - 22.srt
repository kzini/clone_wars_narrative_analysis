1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:20,410
<i>Brothers reunited!</i>

2
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,120
<i>Darth Maul, the sinister Sith
thought to have been destroyed</i>

3
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,790
<i>so many years ago
by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi,</i>

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,760
<i>was found alive
by his brother, Savage Opress,</i>

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>and taken back to Mother Talzin
on Dathomir.</i>

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,680
<i>Though Darth Maul's memory
has yet to be fully restored,</i>

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,520
<i>his need for vengeance has awakened,
more powerful than ever.</i>

8
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,980
Patience, brother. We're almost home.

9
00:00:56,410 --> 00:01:00,420
Far above, far above,
we don't know where we'll fall.

10
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:05,250
Far above, far above,
what once was great is rendered small.

11
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,650
- Brother...
- Kenobi... Kenobi...

12
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,770
Brother, we have to go.

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,650
Kenobi... Kenobi...

14
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,620
Fine. Stay here.

15
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,570
Savage.

16
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,410
Mother.

17
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,080
Shall we?

18
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,590
What happened here?
Where are the rest of the sisters?

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,340
Dooku sent his minions to destroy us,

20
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,940
but we will survive.

21
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,300
We always have.

22
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,770
You found him. I knew you would.

23
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes. He is damaged.

24
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,900
He doesn't remember much of his old life.

25
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,950
Hmm. But he does remember something.

26
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,330
Something or someone named Kenobi.

27
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,750
It is an obsession.

28
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,470
Come, let us fix what has been broken.

29
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,180
Come to me.

30
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,820
Follow us, son of Dathomir.

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,060
Follow me, lost one.

32
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,610
Come, child of Dathomir.

33
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,110
Follow me.

34
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,270
Now sleep.

35
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,840
Now what?

36
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,450
Now we begin.

37
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:17,140
Arise, Maul, reborn son of Dathomir.

38
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,060
Brother?

39
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,150
Brother.

40
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,380
My... My legs.

41
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,260
They have been restored by Mother Talzin.

42
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,900
It has been so long
and my path has been so dark,

43
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,350
darker than I ever dreamed it could be.

44
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,530
And yet you survived.

45
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
Of course I survived.

46
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,060
My hatred kept my spirit intact
even though my body was not.

47
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,490
Yet I was lost and became a rabid animal

48
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,650
and such is how you found me, brother.

49
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,280
Discarded, forgotten.

50
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,410
I have missed so much.

51
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,750
The Force feels out of balance.

52
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,090
Yes. There is conflict. The Clone Wars.

53
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh, yes. So it began without me.

54
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,760
You can begin again, brother.

55
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,030
I was apprentice to the most
powerful being in the galaxy once.

56
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:37,160
I was destined to become so much more,

57
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,450
but I was robbed of that destiny
by the Jedi,

58
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,200
by Obi-Wan Kenobi.

59
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,960
Then you must have your revenge,
my brother.

60
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,500
Yes, we shall start with revenge.

61
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,980
The supply ship's here. Go on ahead.

62
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Brother, what are we doing here?

63
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,670
The Jedi won't be out
this far in the galaxy.

64
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,880
In a galaxy at war, Savage,

65
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,840
there is only one way
to get the attention of the Jedi.

66
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,010
Slaughter of the innocent,

67
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:46,100
mercilessly and without compromise.

68
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,040
<i>There will be more innocent blood
on your hands, Kenobi,</i>

69
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,450
<i>unless you come here, face me.</i>

70
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,700
<i>Come alone and if you do not, this world</i>

71
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,880
<i>will burn.</i>

72
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,920
I have to go.

73
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,340
Not alone you're not.
We'll send a task force with you.

74
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,050
No, you see what he's capable of.

75
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,020
He's a broken, unbalanced monster.

76
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,940
I've dealt with him
before. I can do it again.

77
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,770
I disagree. This is clearly a trap.

78
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
Against my better judgment,
agree with Master Kenobi, I do.

79
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:37,730
Finish what he started long ago,
Obi-Wan must.

80
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm off to Raydonia.

81
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,910
Master Yoda, if this is indeed Darth Maul,

82
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,910
his capture is far too important
to leave it to Obi-Wan alone.

83
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,410
Mmm.

84
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,890
Not alone will Kenobi be,

85
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,050
an unexpected ally he may have.

86
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:02,380
Trust the Force, we must.

87
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,940
Sure, sure. Coming up.

88
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,400
Hey, bounty hunters,
stop monopolizing all of the transmitters.

89
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,110
Shut off your speaker, droid!

90
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,200
These marks are too easy.

91
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,120
Not enough credits.

92
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,450
Whoa!

93
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,710
A million credits!
Who is this Savage Opress?

94
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll take it!

95
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't even consider it, boys.

96
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,600
I've got this one.

97
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Jedi.

98
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,750
I have been waiting for you.

99
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,210
I'm not sure I've made your acquaintance.

100
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,890
I am surprised you could have
forgotten me so easily

101
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:14,140
after I killed your master
and you left me for dead on Naboo.

102
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,480
It is you.

103
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:21,610
You may have forgotten me,
but I will never forget you.

104
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:27,110
You cannot imagine the depths
I would go to to stay alive,

105
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,080
fueled by my singular hatred for you.

106
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,910
That may be so, but I defeated you before,
and I can defeat you again.

107
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,920
Don't be so certain.

108
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:45,260
You?

109
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,420
Still as weak as ever.

110
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,140
And they call you, "Master."

111
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,190
You know, when I cut you in half,
I should have aimed for your neck instead.

112
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Anything more to say?

113
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:09,910
I like your new legs.
They make you look taller.

114
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,570
I will make sure
you stay awake long enough

115
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,580
to feel every single cut.

116
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,080
Your death will be beyond excruciating.

117
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,920
You will suffer as I have suffered!

118
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,060
What a surprise.

119
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,270
My former servant, still an animal.

120
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,440
And you have a friend now.

121
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,910
My brother.

122
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,570
A brother?

123
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,950
Looks like he's half the man
you are, Savage.

124
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,070
How unfortunate.

125
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,950
I was looking for a challenge,

126
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,580
not some wretched castoffs
from the Nightbrothers clan.

127
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,040
What a disappointment.

128
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,290
Who is this, brother?

129
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,800
A Dathomir witch. She betrayed me.

130
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,970
She knows too much, destroy her.

131
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:38,490
Kenobi, don't tell me someone's
finally knocked the fight out of you.

132
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,830
Wake up!

133
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,670
Ventress?

134
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,370
It looks like I'm here to rescue you.

135
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,670
When did you become the good guy?

136
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,500
Don't insult me.

137
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,840
Oh! What a lovely sight to wake up to.

138
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,460
Don't flatter yourself, Kenobi,

139
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,090
you've never been much to look at,
especially now.

140
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,760
The witch and the Jedi.

141
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,560
Here for our taking.

142
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,520
I want that back.

143
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,190
That's fine, red's not my color.

144
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,740
Ready?

145
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,910
Like you even have to ask.

146
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,330
Ventress, catch!

147
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,150
Your master, Qui-Gon Jinn,

148
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,730
I gutted him
while you stood helpless and watched.

149
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,200
How did that make you feel, Obi-Wan?

150
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,000
Your rage has unbalanced you.

151
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,340
That is not the Jedi way, is it?

152
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,850
- We're outmatched.
- You want to run?

153
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,350
I learned from watching you.

154
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,810
Funny. The cockpit?

155
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,560
Now!

156
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,370
Come on, come on!

157
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,420
- Hurry, Kenobi!
- I'm working on it!

158
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,130
Come on, hurry!

159
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,510
Now would be a good time!

160
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,890
Blast!

161
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:15,870
That was cutting it a little close.

162
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,040
You do know, it's not over.

163
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,210
I know.

164
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,540
They'll be after us both now.

165
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,810
What now, brother?
Do we go after them?

166
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,520
No. We will be patient, Savage.

167
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,900
I've waited so many years for my revenge,

168
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,570
I can wait a little longer.

169
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,990
But the Jedi will know
that you have survived.

170
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:48,280
They will be coming for us.

171
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,740
I am counting on it.
