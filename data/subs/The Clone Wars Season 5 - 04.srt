1
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,940
<i>The rebels elect a new leader!</i>

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,700
<i>With their training complete,</i>

3
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,770
<i>Obi-Wan and Anakin have left
Ahsoka on Onderon</i>

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,740
<i>to monitor and advise the rebels</i>

5
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,280
<i>as they continue to strike
Separatists targets</i>

6
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,610
<i>under the command of Steela Gerrera.</i>

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,220
<i>Facing an escalation of rebel attacks,</i>

8
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:38,100
<i>the Separatists
have sent reinforcements</i>

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,690
<i>to strengthen their hold
on the city of Iziz,</i>

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,490
<i>as the battle for the planet unfolds.</i>

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,560
Oh, yummy, yummy.

12
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,600
Looks like more reinforcements.

13
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,510
A small droid convoy leading
a multi-troop transport.

14
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,400
<i>An AAT bringing up the rear.</i>

15
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:25,970
Copy.

16
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,820
Ah! It's an ambush!

17
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,270
We need reinforcements.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,800
Ah, no!

19
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,760
Do not be afraid,
brothers and sisters.

20
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,100
We mean you no harm.

21
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,740
It's time.

22
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:50,220
<i>People of Onderon,</i>

23
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,820
<i>the time has come
to take back our freedom.</i>

24
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,260
<i>We have all been deceived.</i>

25
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,270
<i>King Rash is a traitor</i>

26
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,700
<i>who has sold Onderon to
the Separatists for the crown.</i>

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,230
But Onderon is ours.

28
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,200
We need your strength
to reclaim our planet

29
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,840
and restore our sovereignty
under our true king,

30
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:12,170
King Dendup.

31
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,020
The terrorists
are no longer a nuisance

32
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,890
but a threat to Onderon.

33
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,330
It is only a matter of time
before they are all eliminated.

34
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,660
How much longer before
they plunge us into chaos?

35
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,200
It seems they're only
targeting the droid army.

36
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,470
If you allowed
the royal Onderon militia

37
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,140
to assume control of security,

38
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:42,740
the terrorists may stop
and discuss terms.

39
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,740
You will assume nothing,
General Tandin.

40
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,210
With their coordinated attacks
and weapons,

41
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,550
it is possible they're finding
sympathy within your own ranks.

42
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,450
The threat is external,

43
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,550
and your reinforcements
have done little to stop them.

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,260
We will not negotiate with terrorists.

45
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,630
They fear diplomacy.

46
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,560
They embrace mayhem.

47
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,710
What do we know about them?

48
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,540
We've identified Steela Gerrera

49
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,210
as the woman in the hologram.

50
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,710
Her brother, Saw,
is also part of the group

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,740
as well as the fugitive criminal
Lux Bonteri.

52
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,810
The late senator Mina Bonteri's son?

53
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,180
Yes, my lord.

54
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,980
Why was I not told of this?

55
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,650
You just were.

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Enough.

57
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,190
It's clear that Dendup is behind this.

58
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,690
We mustn't allow his followers
any momentum.

59
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,760
Justice must come swiftly,

60
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,000
without mercy.

61
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,360
Bring him in.

62
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,140
What now?

63
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,340
Your supporters have begun
to publicly decry my reign.

64
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,610
Am I still to believe you
are not behind their attacks?

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,480
You must order them to surrender.

66
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,520
Impossible.

67
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,060
I have been isolated and alone
without visitors,

68
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,270
confined to my prison.

69
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,400
Again, the will of the people
is theirs, not mine.

70
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,430
Well, then we shall see
what the will of the people

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,140
is made of.

72
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,380
Okay, guys, put it in the back
with the rest.

73
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,580
Steela.

74
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,480
They're executing King Dendup
tomorrow in Yolahn Square.

75
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,526
Where did you hear this?

76
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,480
Malgan Market.

77
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,820
The merchants.

78
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,720
The Separatists are saying
he's behind our attacks.

79
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,360
More lies.

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:46,300
They're making him an example
to humiliate us.

81
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,330
Maybe, but their efforts
could work against them.

82
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,070
Executing him would
only make him a martyr.

83
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,710
We can't let him die.

84
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,940
We have to break him out somehow.

85
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,070
No, we should wait
until he's in public,

86
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,440
at the execution.

87
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,440
That's where they'd expect it.

88
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,810
I know, but this is our moment.

89
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,320
We'll save him
for all of Iziz to witness.

90
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,920
We don't have much time.

91
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,900
They're counting on us to show up.

92
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,220
Where are you going?

93
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,320
Trust me.

94
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,390
Stop.

95
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,130
Let me take care of this.

96
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,430
This isn't about you.

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,960
We can't afford
a reckless move right now.

98
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,930
Yeah?
Go write a speech about it.

99
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,870
You have to weigh the risk.

100
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,410
That's why I'm going alone.

101
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,950
Follow him.

102
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,630
Steela.

103
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,760
Saw is strong.

104
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,300
He'll be fine.

105
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,810
He's always been brash.

106
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,270
Never thinks.

107
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,970
He doesn't realize,
by leaving us, he's hurting us.

108
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,880
We need a plan.

109
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,180
They'd bring King Dendup
through the east entrance

110
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,280
of Yolahn Square.

111
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,980
Security will be tight.

112
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,020
And rescuing him will...

113
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,360
will not be easy.

114
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,060
Lux, please don't
look at me like that.

115
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,160
Forgive me.

116
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,290
I'm sorry. I...

117
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,660
Listen.

118
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,630
I just need to be alone right now.

119
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,270
Gather everyone to go over the plan.

120
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,240
Of course.

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,250
<i>I sense fear in you, Ahsoka.</i>

122
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,050
The rebels are divided.

123
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,920
If they try to rescue the king now,

124
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,990
I'm afraid we might lose them.

125
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,060
<i>We cannot control their fate.</i>

126
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,560
It's just,

127
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,830
they're risking their lives
to save just one.

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,130
<i>Do not underestimate the king's power.</i>

129
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,570
<i>He represents hope</i>

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,640
<i>and he's critical to their success.</i>

131
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,780
I feel responsible for them.

132
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,110
<i>I know you do, Snips,</i>

133
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,320
<i>but remember, purpose
must come before feelings.</i>

134
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,280
I know, Master.

135
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,290
<i>Step in only if you must,
but remember,</i>

136
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,630
<i>if this experiment is to become
an effective strategy,</i>

137
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,830
<i>they must learn to survive
on their own.</i>

138
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,940
Yes, Master Kenobi.

139
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,730
I understand.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,530
Uh, hey!

141
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,640
My lord.

142
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,380
Who are you?

143
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,010
I'm Saw Gerrera.

144
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,910
What do you want?

145
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,350
You freedom, sire.

146
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,890
You're to be executed tomorrow,

147
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,350
but I'm getting you out of here.

148
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:02,650
The people of Onderon need your help.

149
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,320
Stand up.

150
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,490
Are you one of the meddlers
creating disorder,

151
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,990
interfering in the affairs
of the throne?

152
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,430
Only to restore your kingship
as the rightful ruler.

153
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,230
I see.

154
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,400
This was all my doing.

155
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,500
I opened the door.

156
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,410
That's why the Separatists are here.

157
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,450
I was faced with a difficult choice:

158
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,510
To join the Republic
or the Confederacy.

159
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,050
Both are corrupt,

160
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,960
but I had to pick a side
before one was chosen for me,

161
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,690
except I chose neither.

162
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,760
Now is the time to take back Onderon.

163
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,300
Our movement is gaining momentum.

164
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,760
It has the backing of the Jedi.

165
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,660
Jedi?

166
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,230
Yes, sire.

167
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,100
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

168
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,100
Follow me, sire.

169
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,270
Onderon awaits.

170
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,810
One-way shield.

171
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,460
Do any of you have questions?

172
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,170
It's a risky plan,

173
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,970
but it's our best shot.

174
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,350
Ahsoka, will you join us?

175
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,670
I can't.

176
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,570
I've already been more involved
than the Council wanted.

177
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,280
I'm afraid I've been instructed
to sit this one out.

178
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,910
They have Saw.

179
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,650
He's alive, but I watched them
take him away.

180
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,490
We have to save him.

181
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,500
No.

182
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,000
We have to save King Dendup.

183
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,240
We don't have time
or the bodies to do both.

184
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,650
He's your brother.

185
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,880
That's what Saw would want,
what he would expect.

186
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,680
And I expect the same
from everyone in this room.

187
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,850
I know it's a hard choice,
but I agree.

188
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,950
Purpose must come before feelings.

189
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,940
Where are the other terrorists?

190
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,440
Onderon is our system, not yours.

191
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,450
Enough.

192
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,290
We have to keep him alive.

193
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,590
He is a direct link to the terrorists.

194
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,160
You pity him.

195
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,700
I pity your ignorance.

196
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,670
You can control the people of Onderon,

197
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,840
but you won't sustain it
against their will.

198
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,780
What you're doing guarantees
others will take his place.

199
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,610
They, too, will suffer.

200
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,950
Then the war is lost.

201
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,290
You have strong tactics,
but it's unfortunate

202
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,720
you cannot calculate
a different approach.

203
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,140
Here, drink.

204
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,980
It will give you strength.

205
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,020
The Separatists have
very little compassion

206
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,500
or patience for things
that stand in their way.

207
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,850
Hmm.

208
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,460
We have a duty
to protect what's ours, General,

209
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:55,000
a duty once entrusted to you.

210
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:58,230
I thought you depleted
your arrogance with Kalani.

211
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:01,770
It replenishes every hour.

212
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,480
King Rash is the crowned head
of Onderon.

213
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,100
What's yours is his,

214
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,970
and he will do with it as he pleases.

215
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,340
Dendup is the true king.

216
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,980
Are you following his orders?

217
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:17,350
We take orders from no one.

218
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,180
Aligning yourself with the past

219
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,380
does not bode well for your future.

220
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:23,180
We share the same future.

221
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,060
We can sit here as free men
or servants of the Separatists.

222
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,760
I am free,

223
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,290
while you have chosen
to become a terrorist.

224
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,960
I'm not a terrorist.
I'm a patriot.

225
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,630
And resistance is not terrorism.

226
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
King Dendup chose his people

227
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,140
instead of taking a side
in the intergalactic war.

228
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,580
Separatists have taken over
Onderon because we let them.

229
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,880
As your king,

230
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,180
I present to you Ramsis Dendup

231
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,450
not as a former king

232
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,320
but as a criminal

233
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:34,720
sponsoring terrorist acts
against the people of Onderon.

234
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:36,660
But fear not, good citizens.

235
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:39,860
As your leader and protector,

236
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:43,330
I will see that you are safe
from such villainy.

237
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,670
He has betrayed you,

238
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,370
and today he will pay
for those treasonous deeds

239
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,870
with his life.

240
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,960
Your people will see you
into the next world.

241
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,390
May you find forgiveness there.

242
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,170
Time to die.

243
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,880
Wait for my signal.

244
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,010
Ready weapons.

245
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,990
Not yet.

246
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,190
Now!

247
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,170
Come on. Go, go, go!

248
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,016
Come with us.

249
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Blast 'em!

250
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,290
Follow me.

251
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,930
This way.

252
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,100
Come on. Let's go.

253
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,350
Surrender now or die.

254
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,260
It's over.

255
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,590
Do as they say.

256
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,360
Calm yourselves.
The threat is over.

257
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,460
See for yourselves as these traitors

258
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:00,230
all endure the same punishment.

259
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:06,670
Good try, sis.

260
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,990
Ready weapons.

261
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,900
They're innocent!

262
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,070
Let them go.

263
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,870
The snake will not strike again.

264
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,240
Stop.

265
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,070
What?

266
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,370
The only snake I see, sire,

267
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,270
is you.

268
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,820
Traitor.

269
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,090
I was.

270
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,270
Not anymore.

271
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,300
What are you doing, General?

272
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,100
Go.

273
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,580
Let them through.

274
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,650
Make way.

275
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,080
Everyone go with them.

276
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,127
But, sir...

277
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,920
Go.

278
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,690
Huh. What now, General?

279
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,130
As soon as you release me,
you'll be shot dead.

280
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,970
Jedi?

281
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,680
General, follow me.

282
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,750
After them. Kill them.

283
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,820
Kill them!

284
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,960
Dendup is the true king!

285
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,390
We want the Separatists gone.

286
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,860
Save Dendup!

287
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,940
Why now?

288
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,980
It was time
for a new approach, my lord.

289
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,780
Do I have your loyalty?

290
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,180
And that of the army.

291
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,020
You also have ours.

292
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,690
With your rule, our numbers will grow.

293
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,290
Thanks, child.

294
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,390
Your mother would be proud.

295
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,960
Thank you, my lord.

296
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,330
We must first win the will
of the people.

297
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,200
That is the only way.

298
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,400
The Separatists will assemble
their forces.

299
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:52,310
Count Dooku will want me dead
more than ever.

300
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,240
Then we'll have to teach them
another lesson.

301
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,480
Together.

302
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,390
Ahsoka, I knew you couldn't
resist a good fight.

303
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,120
Am I becoming that predictable?

304
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,460
Only to me.

305
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,930
The Separatists definitely
know we're backing the rebels.

306
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,730
<i>Then prepare yourself.</i>

307
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,370
<i>The real fight is about to begin.</i>

308
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,610
Will you be able to send some help?

309
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,370
<i>That's up to the Council, Ahsoka.</i>
