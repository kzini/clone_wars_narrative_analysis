1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>Crossroads!</i>

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,602
<i>After leaving the Jedi Order,</i>

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:23,565
<i>Ahsoka Tano finds herself</i>
<i>far away from the life she once knew.</i>

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>Here in the underworld of Coruscant,</i>

5
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:29,738
<i>she meets Trace Martez, an aspiring pilot,</i>
<i>and her older sister Rafa,</i>

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>a streetwise gambler</i>
<i>with lofty aspirations.</i>

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,534
<i>In their short time together,</i>

8
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:38,496
<i>Ahsoka realizes</i>
<i>not everyone sees the Jedi as heroes,</i>

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:41,499
<i>a lesson</i>
<i>she only recently learned herself.</i>

10
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:56,056
I can tell
you've worked on starships before.

11
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,391
That must have been
some academy you went to Topside.

12
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,810
Yeah, the best.

13
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,771
What was it called?

14
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,774
Uh... Skywalker Academy.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:11,529
Skywalker? Never heard of it,
but what do I know living down here?

16
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,698
I never really heard of any academy.

17
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:15,742
Not like I was ever gonna attend one.

18
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,452
Why not?

19
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,955
First,
there aren't any academies down here.

20
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,917
Second, if there was,
I couldn't afford it.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,044
I mean, look around. This is it.

22
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:32,926
Rafa and I inherited this hangar
after our parents... split.

23
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,929
And the shop Rafa owns?

24
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:39,140
She won it gambling so she could use it
as a front for her schemes.

25
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,101
Where'd you get the ship?

26
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,561
This? This is me.

27
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:48,149
I did odd jobs, mech work,
whatever I could to make some credits,

28
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,694
and assembled it piece by piece.

29
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:55,156
All that, plus Rafa chipping in.
And now I've got myself a starship.

30
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,908
Impressive.

31
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:00,161
No, impressive is coming up.

32
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,831
Once the <i>Silver Angel</i>
revs up its hyperdrive.

33
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,167
The <i>Silver Angel</i>?

34
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,460
Yeah, why?

35
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,172
I don't know. I just never heard a name
like that before.

36
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,842
Wait, you're saying it's a bad name?

37
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,595
Hey, it's your ship,
you call it what you want.

38
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,889
Why don't you name my bike
while you're at it?

39
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,350
I did. Trash. Its name is Trash.

40
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,977
Very funny.

41
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,940
So, once you're done,
where are you headed?

42
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,360
I don't know. This is all new to me.

43
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,280
That's why you should stick around.

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,574
I figured I'd be on my own for a bit.

45
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,285
Yeah, that doesn't seem
like the best idea.

46
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,538
I mean, you crashed here
on that piece of junk.

47
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,582
What if you didn't crash
on my landing platform?

48
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,500
Things could've gotten messy for you.

49
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,629
Believe me, things couldn't be
a bigger mess for me

50
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:52,756
than they already are.

51
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,092
So you'll stay a little while longer,
at least.

52
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,802
That way we can test the <i>Silver Angel.</i>

53
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,808
All right,
as long as Rafa doesn't mind.

54
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,478
"As long as Rafa doesn't mind" what?

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,688
Ahsoka's gonna be staying on for a bit.

56
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,191
You got any skills?

57
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,276
Only useful ones.

58
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,403
We'll find out soon enough.

59
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,406
What's up?

60
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,826
Look, I wouldn't ask you to do this,
but I'm in a tough spot.

61
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,206
I hired a starship and crew for a job.

62
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,042
You what? You were gonna leave me here?

63
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,129
No, I was gonna do a job,
make us some money, and be back.

64
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,007
But then the pilot backed out
and took his ship with him, and--

65
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,426
I don't know what's worse.
That you were gonna do this

66
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,513
or that you hired a pilot other than me
to do it with.

67
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,848
Well, now I need you.

68
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,642
Only as a backup.

69
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,560
What's the job?

70
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,313
I'll tell you once we're underway.

71
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,107
I still haven't agreed to it.

72
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,609
Trace, please, I need your help with this.

73
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:59,072
You mean, you need the best pilot around
and the fastest ship you know?

74
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,408
Yes, to both of those.

75
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,992
Who looks out for you, huh?

76
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,244
You do, Rafa.

77
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,124
That's right.
Remember, we can't count on anyone.

78
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,460
So we count on ourselves.
And maybe Ahsoka.

79
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,879
Maybe.

80
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,882
Come on. I wanna get going.
Go warm the engines up.

81
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,891
You show up outta nowhere,

82
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,352
suddenly you and my sister
are inseparable?

83
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,687
What are you after?

84
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,105
Excuse me?

85
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,983
Come on. Everyone plays an angle.

86
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,194
I don't mind,
except when it involves Trace.

87
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,573
So tell me, what are you after?

88
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,533
Her mech-bay? Her ship?

89
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't have an angle, unless maybe to
keep you both out of trouble.

90
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,206
Hmm.

91
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,877
You ever thought you might be the trouble
she needs to stay away from?

92
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:11,978
Ahsoka, Rafa, welcome aboard the...
the <i>Silver Angel</i>.

93
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:16,358
- The <i>Silver Angel</i>?
- You should rethink that.

94
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,276
That's what I told her.

95
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,195
Ugh, just strap in.

96
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,954
Trace, where are you going?

97
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,831
I'm just trying to get into this lane.

98
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:16,334
That's a military lane. You can't go
there. That's a restricted area.

99
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,177
-We're being hailed.
-Don't answer that.

100
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,054
-We have to answer that.
-No, we don't.

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,140
Trace, just get us out of here.

102
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't do anything
that makes us look suspicious.

103
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,643
We already look suspicious.

104
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,313
-Fly higher.
-Stop telling me what to do.

105
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,941
-Pull up. Pull up!
-Stop telling me what to do.

106
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,821
Don't answer that.

107
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,615
This is the <i>Silver Angel</i>.
What can I do for you?

108
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,784
<i>Have you lost your mind?</i>

109
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,745
<i>This is military airspace.</i>

110
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,165
<i>Civilian transports are not authorized</i>
<i>to be in this sector.</i>

111
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,834
<i>I'll have your star pilot license</i>
<i>for this!</i>

112
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,712
"License"? Do I need one of those?

113
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,298
Uh, sorry. So-- So sorry.

114
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:07,093
It won't happen again.
Just teaching my younger sister to fly.

115
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,305
Oh, you're teaching me to fly?
That's a laugh.

116
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,557
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>What's your license number?</i>

117
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:15,852
Just get in the transport lane and fly.

118
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,401
Who was on board that transport?

119
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:27,572
Oh, just some rookie pilots,
apparently on their first maneuvers.

120
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:29,908
I was just about to send a detachment
to arrest them.

121
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:45,173
Should I send a detachment, General?

122
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,427
No. It's nothing.

123
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,396
You still haven't told us
where we're going.

124
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,775
She doesn't like surprises, I see.

125
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,659
Really? How'd you manage that?

126
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,163
This is what I was working towards.
Take us out, Captain.

127
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:34,973
This is exciting.
I've never been to hyperspace before.

128
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,475
What? What have you been flying?

129
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,645
Oh, mainly speeders, you know,
maintenance vehicles.

130
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,313
Whatever I could get my hands on.

131
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,358
See why I tried to hire a different pilot?

132
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,278
Trace's flying is more of a dream
than a reality.

133
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,448
-What did you say?
-Oh, I-I said the ship flies like a dream.

134
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,659
Yeah, a bad one.

135
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,078
What? Oh...

136
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,835
I left the air brakes on.
That could've been bad.

137
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,267
Kessel. You're taking us to Kessel?

138
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,103
I'm taking us to fortune and glory.

139
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,815
I've heard pilots talk about this place.
It's legendary.

140
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,985
Yeah, it's legendary for its corruption.

141
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,988
Rafa, what are we doing here?

142
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,824
Picking up medicine.

143
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,970
This place is beautiful.

144
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,182
See, Ahsoka,
there's nothing to worry about.

145
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:22,580
Which one of you is Rafa Martez?

146
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,165
I am.

147
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,378
I am Kinash Lock, King Yaruba's majordomo.

148
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,756
We've been expecting you.
We've prepared a banquet

149
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,426
to show his thanks for your services.

150
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,469
Lead the way, Sir.

151
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,471
Welcome to the big time.

152
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:05,123
So, when is the king showing?

153
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,793
He leaves matters like this to me.

154
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:11,880
However,
if you show yourself to be dependable,

155
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,633
you will have the opportunity
to meet His Royal Highness.

156
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,552
We won't disappoint.

157
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,846
I've got one of the fastest ships around.

158
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,687
What kind of medicine are we transporting?

159
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,149
The essence of the medicine.

160
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:36,696
You will deliver three containers
of unrefined spice.

161
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,867
Upon satisfactory delivery,
you will be awarded a full shipment

162
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,205
and a contract to transport for us
on a continual basis.

163
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,291
May as well get that contract ready.

164
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,085
'Cause we've got the fastest ship around.

165
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:51,836
They know, Trace.

166
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,547
We're working for a king.

167
00:11:55,465 --> 00:12:00,261
Many things can be made out of spice
and they're not all good.

168
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,062
I'm not sure what you mean.

169
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:14,025
In this time of war,
our spice is refined into a medicine

170
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,361
that saves people across the galaxy.

171
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,948
The Yaruba Family of Kessel

172
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:24,828
has always been a promoter
of health and happiness across the stars.

173
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:32,502
Now, come, Ms. Martez. Let us get
the spice into this very fast ship.

174
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,767
Running spice is dangerous.
The transport ships get attacked often.

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,354
Yeah,
by pirates looking for a quick score.

176
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:56,818
But they always go after the bigger Kessel
transport ships, obvious targets.

177
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,070
That's why the king hired us.

178
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:01,906
We don't fit the description
of your normal transport.

179
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,244
But we're leaving Kessel. It's not hard
to figure out what we might be here for.

180
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,247
You know a lot about Kessel
for a mechanic.

181
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,999
I've heard the stories.

182
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,252
Then you better hope
the pilot of the <i>Silver Angel</i>

183
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,962
is as good as she says she is.

184
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:26,222
I'm starting to see why Rafa
didn't originally hire you for this job.

185
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,515
It's dangerous.

186
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:29,684
That's just your nerves talking.

187
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:35,607
No, I'm serious. Running spice
is no simple transport mission.

188
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,692
Rafa looks out for me.

189
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,986
Sure, I wasn't her first choice
for this job.

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,198
But she wouldn't have asked me to do it
if she didn't believe I could.

191
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:46,076
How many times
has Rafa done a job like this?

192
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,079
I don't think she ever has.

193
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,374
So, how can she possibly know
what we're up against?

194
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,418
Hey, there's a first time for everything.

195
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,238
We're coming up on the mining zone.

196
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,539
Now, this looks like
the Kessel from the stories.

197
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,834
Spice mining
has made the people of Kessel wealthy.

198
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,585
There's always a price to be paid.

199
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,587
There's the platform now.

200
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:51,141
Look at all those droids.

201
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,355
The king's spice sales
must buy thousands of them.

202
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,610
Trace, those are not droids.
They're people.

203
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:32,599
-Must be local workers.
-I think the term is slaves.

204
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:37,520
Can't be. An operation this large,
the Republic wouldn't stand for it.

205
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:38,938
They'd shut the place down.

206
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:42,525
Yeah, you'd think they would.

207
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,126
You're all ready to depart.

208
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,839
Ahsoka, let's go make sure
they secure the bins.

209
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:12,847
I'm not sure if I like her or not.

210
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,642
You never like any of my friends.

211
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,853
She's not family, Trace. Remember that.

212
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,564
I'll keep an eye on her.
You just do your job.

213
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,859
Kid, I got us a job.
The rest is up to you.

214
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,278
Now, let's get this spice
where it belongs.

215
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,881
Next stop Oba Diah, right?

216
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,428
Oba Diah, indeed.
Marg Krim better have my money waiting.

217
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,222
Marg Krim? The Pyke crime boss?

218
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,933
Why am I not surprised
you know about the Pykes?

219
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:59,894
As a matter of fact,
how do you know about the Pykes?

220
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:02,063
I know you can't make a deal with them.

221
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,523
Already did.

222
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:06,443
Trace, how does she know so much?

223
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,028
How do you know so much?

224
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,196
I pay attention to the world around me,

225
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,741
like the fact that
the Pykes are gangsters.

226
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:16,202
Gangsters?
What, like Pintu back on Coruscant?

227
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:20,165
No. Much worse. Galactically worse.

228
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,751
They'll take your ship,
your life, everything!

229
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,795
-My ship?
-Well, I took a job, Ahsoka.

230
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,339
We need all the credits we can get.

231
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,967
This is bad, Trace.

232
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,553
Rafa, what are they gonna do to my ship?

233
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,766
Nothing! See, this is why
I didn't want you for this job.

234
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,143
I wouldn't bring that up right now
if I were you.

235
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,395
Why not make the best of a bad situation

236
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,523
and deliver this spice to someplace
that can use it for medicine?

237
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,692
-No one is taking my ship.
-Because that doesn't pay,

238
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:52,655
and Trace and I have a lot of people on
Coruscant waiting for money we owe them.

239
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,158
No. You owe them, not her.

240
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:59,204
Sisters take care of each other.
We can't pay off debt with your morality.

241
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:00,830
No one is taking my ship.

242
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,833
Think of all the good you could do

243
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:07,170
if we delivered the spice
to someplace else instead of the Pykes.

244
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:10,298
Think of all the good you can do
by helping us finish this job.

245
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:13,593
I said no one is taking my ship!

246
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,727
What was that?

247
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,940
-Oh, no. What did you do?
-What did you do?

248
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:28,692
I dumped the spice.

249
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,402
-You did what?
-You did what?

250
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,738
Problem solved.
Neither one of you gets your way.

251
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,782
And I keep my ship. You're welcome.

252
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,787
Of all the choices you could make,
that is literally the worst one.

253
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,665
I can't believe this,
but I agree with her.

254
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:44,833
What?

255
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,502
The spice gave us options. Now--

256
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,715
Now we have a deal to deliver spice
to an intergalactic crime syndicate

257
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,508
and no spice to deliver.

258
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,512
But I thought delivering spice
to gangsters was a bad thing.

259
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,768
It is. But you have to pay them somehow.
Right now, we owe the Pykes.

260
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,647
Then how was turning the spice
into medicine gonna solve anything?

261
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:09,399
Well, that was more of an ethical debate.

262
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:12,485
I hadn't figured out
how to solve the Pyke problem yet.

263
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,320
You two are just a pair, that's for sure.

264
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,407
I'll tell you what, I can think of one way
to pay off the Pykes.

265
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,284
And I'm standing in it.

266
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,077
No one is touching my ship.

267
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:22,829
You should have thought of that

268
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:26,583
before you dumped 30,000 credits
worth of spice into space.

269
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,377
Stop it, both of you.

270
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:32,005
I said
I didn't have it figured it out yet!

271
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,715
Oh, but you do now?

272
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:35,842
We'll find out.

273
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,815
Okay. Do we need to go over it again?

274
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:54,402
Nope. Because no matter
how many times we go over it,

275
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:57,238
I can tell you, it's not going to work.

276
00:19:57,322 --> 00:19:58,615
Why?

277
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,158
Because it's a bad plan.

278
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,327
It is a pretty bad plan.

279
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,955
I'm sorry.
Did either of you have a better one?

280
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:10,585
Well, then, sounds like my plan
is the best one we got.

281
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:14,714
That's not really addressing
whether or not it's gonna work.

282
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,051
Don't worry. I've got a trick or two
that you don't know about.

283
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,135
Care to share?

284
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,888
No. Not yet at least.

285
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:01,302
I assume that you had no trouble
transporting the spice from Kessel?

286
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:07,308
Not at all. This is one of
the smoothest jobs I've ever had.

287
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,644
Hmm. Good.

288
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:15,692
If anything had happened, it would have
been very unfortunate for you.

289
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,361
Here is your payment.

290
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:26,119
Now, let us take a look at that cargo.

291
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:28,538
You don't trust me? I mean, you hired me.

292
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,916
I don't trust anyone who isn't a Pyke.

293
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,091
You want to pay us our credits
and send us on our way.

294
00:21:42,594 --> 00:21:44,262
Here are your credits.

295
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:47,724
Now, go on your way.

296
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,152
I take it back. I'm liking this plan.

297
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,991
This is highly irregular.

298
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,661
I'm going to make sure
everything sorts out to our liking.

299
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:10,663
Sure.

300
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,876
Thanks for everything.
We'll hopefully see you soon.

301
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,586
Fire up the ship.

302
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,006
Just a moment.

303
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:23,093
I need the code to unlock the bin.

304
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:26,429
Uh... I think we transmitted that
to you already.

305
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,223
Let's get out of here, Trace.

306
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:42,904
Where is the spice?

307
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:45,365
What? I don't believe it.

308
00:22:45,782 --> 00:22:49,953
Kessel must have double-crossed you.
Well, that's really unfortunate.

309
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:54,040
I want patrol ships to cut them off.
Engage the tractor beam.

310
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,876
You better get us out of here now.

311
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:01,881
Patrol ships.

312
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:04,092
They won't be able to keep up.

313
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,847
What was that?

314
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,890
That is a tractor beam, Rafa.

315
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,437
Just so you know,
when they interrogate me,

316
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,064
I'm blaming the whole thing on you.

317
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,526
Between the three of us,
there's plenty of blame to go around.
