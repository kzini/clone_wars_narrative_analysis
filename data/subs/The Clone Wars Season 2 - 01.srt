1
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,408
Jedi trapped on Felucia!

2
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:21,929
Clones are surrounded by droid forces.

3
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:24,609
Their only hope is to escape
on Republic gunships

4
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:27,051
waiting to land on the embattled surface.

5
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,091
Jedi cruisers have managed
to blow a hole in the droid defenses

6
00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,332
and have sent gunships to the rescue.

7
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:37,294
Warthog, protect the gunships.
I will take out the fighters.

8
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,659
They made it through the first wave.

9
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,540
Concentrate all fire
on the cruiser on the left.

10
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,750
I can't shake these two droids!

11
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:25,951
Come around
and I'll try to get them off your tail.

12
00:01:28,993 --> 00:01:30,512
General!

13
00:01:37,996 --> 00:01:39,076
Look out!

14
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,678
That was close.

15
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,839
If those fighters got through,
then our gunships can't be far behind.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,360
Prepare the troops to evacuate.

17
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,562
Go! Go!
Come on!

18
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:03,204
Come on, grunts! We are leaving!

19
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,687
Ahsoka should be back
from her jungle patrol by now.

20
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:14,767
I'll try to contact her again.
Ahsoka, where are you?

21
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,810
- Ahsoka, what is your location?
- About 6 clicks east, Master.

22
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,211
We've engaged the enemy
and we've got them on the run.

23
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,453
They're here to extract us.
We're leaving!

24
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,894
What? What...

25
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:34,735
We can't retreat now, Master.
I've broken through.

26
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:37,336
Move it, trooper!
Come on, double-time!

27
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,857
The droids are retreating.

28
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:43,338
We're outnumbered. You must evacuate.
That is an order!

29
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,899
Master Skywalker taught me
never to let up

30
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,339
when the tinnies are on the run.

31
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,940
They are running back here
to regroup with the main force!

32
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,103
You are putting your troops' lives
in danger, young one.

33
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:01,344
You will get on the gunship
when we arrive.

34
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:04,025
- Where's Ahsoka?
- Following your teachings.

35
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,146
- Is she winning?
- For now.

36
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,629
- She's not stopping.
- Land in front of them.

37
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,151
What are you doing?

38
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:29,354
- Get in the ship, now!
- Can't you see they're retreating?

39
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,235
They're about to overrun you, Ahsoka.
You just can't see it.

40
00:03:32,356 --> 00:03:34,596
Now, follow orders and get in the ship.

41
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,922
Padawan Ahsoka,

44
00:03:59,245 --> 00:04:02,925
- More to add, do you?
- I know I was wrong.

45
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:07,327
I just got so caught up in my own success
I didn't look at the battle as a whole.

46
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:11,128
I wasn't being disobedient, I just forgot.

47
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:14,169
Masters, this incident is my responsibility.

48
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,130
Because of Ahsoka's advanced abilities,
I forgot how young she is.

49
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:20,091
I gave her more freedom
than I should have.

50
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:23,892
That may be, but it doesn't excuse
what happened on Felucia.

51
00:04:23,934 --> 00:04:27,414
I think she needs some time
away from the battlefield.

52
00:04:29,696 --> 00:04:34,176
On Archive security,
reflect on your actions you can, Padawan.

53
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:38,498
- Guard duty? For how long?
- Longer, now.

54
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:49,061
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- I know.

55
00:04:49,182 --> 00:04:51,582
I was a Padawan not that long ago.

56
00:04:52,303 --> 00:04:57,664
Madame Jocasta Nu, this is Ahsoka Tano.
She is to be your new security officer.

57
00:04:57,705 --> 00:05:00,945
- Hello, Madame.
- So good to meet you.

58
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,307
Let's show you around.

59
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,669
There is more knowledge here
than anywhere else in the galaxy.

60
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:12,670
Master Kenobi says
there are even texts here

61
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,190
that are forbidden to be read.

62
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:19,672
Well, the Archives hold
a great many secrets, 'tis true.

63
00:05:20,273 --> 00:05:24,074
Beyond this door lies the holocron vault.

64
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:29,075
The holocrons contain the most
closely guarded secrets of the Jedi Order.

65
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,916
Good morning, Master Fisto.

66
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:38,358
- Can we go inside?
- Oh, I'm afraid not, my dear.

67
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,720
I haven't been inside myself for years.

68
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,681
Only members of the Jedi Council
are allowed access.

69
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:48,762
Guarding the holocrons
is one of the most important duties

70
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:51,763
a Jedi can be given, Ahsoka.

71
00:05:51,804 --> 00:05:55,004
- Do you think you're up to the task?
- Definitely.

72
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,490
Excuse the interruption.

73
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,091
As I was saying, bounty hunter,
I have need of your services.

74
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:17,972
I'm listening.

75
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:21,373
I need a Jedi holocron.

76
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:25,375
To get a holocron,
I'd have to break into the Jedi Temple.

77
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:28,575
It's impossible, not to mention deadly.

78
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:32,897
Perhaps your reputation
has been exaggerated.

79
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:34,978
I want a Rogue-class starfighter

80
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,979
with elite weapons,
cloaking device, the works.

81
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:43,701
- Oh, and triple my usual rate.
- Your price is of no concern.

82
00:06:44,502 --> 00:06:49,303
I will also provide you
with the means to get inside the Temple.

83
00:06:50,104 --> 00:06:51,623
You've got a deal.

84
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,705
The setback at Felucia has affected
our efforts in the whole sector.

85
00:06:56,787 --> 00:06:58,506
It'll take weeks before we...

86
00:06:58,988 --> 00:07:03,188
- Master Yoda, what is it?
- A disturbance in the Force.

87
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,549
Intruders there will be in this Temple.

88
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:14,951
You know, if you would just tell me
what it is you're doing back there,

89
00:07:15,033 --> 00:07:16,793
I could probably be of some assistance.

90
00:07:16,873 --> 00:07:20,153
Look, I'm just doing
some maintenance.

91
00:07:20,194 --> 00:07:22,274
You've been having memory crashes.

92
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:25,836
That is preposterous.
I have no memory of any crashes.

93
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:29,117
Oh, my goodness!
I have no memory of any crashes!

94
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,397
Exactly.

95
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:34,759
Oh, no. I am doomed!
Bane, you have to help me!

96
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,520
- Calm down, I'm done.
- Oh. Thank you.

97
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:40,080
Get the door.

98
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:43,361
I am a techno-service droid,
not a butler droid.

99
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:46,242
Can it, Todo. You are what I say you are.

100
00:07:46,284 --> 00:07:47,603
Well! Then...

101
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,286
Who are you?

102
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,567
I am Todo 360, techno-service droid.
Who are you?

103
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:02,249
- None of your business.
- Everyone is in a good mood today.

104
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:11,091
- Who's that?
- Bolla Ropal. Jedi, out in the Mid Rim.

105
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:13,292
- We going after him?
- Soon.

106
00:08:13,373 --> 00:08:15,733
Right now we're stealing a holocron.

107
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:20,174
Impossible. The only place
you can get a holocron is...

108
00:08:20,216 --> 00:08:24,056
I know, inside the main vaults
of the Jedi Temple.

109
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:28,497
Fortunately, our Sith Lord client
has set us up with some help.

110
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:32,019
For one, the map of the Temple
you're looking at right now.

111
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,700
For another, a security chip
that I've placed in my droid.

112
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,980
I have been given all the technical data

113
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,622
regarding security systems
in the Jedi Temple.

114
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:42,942
Both the vent shafts and the vault itself

115
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:46,583
are equipped with all kinds of traps
and security measures.

116
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:48,224
Todo can take them out,

117
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:52,345
but we'll need help
from someone inside the Jedi library.

118
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:56,227
And that's where your talents
as a changeling will come in.

119
00:08:56,348 --> 00:09:02,149
- He looks like a Jedi.
- He was. His name was Ord Enisence.

120
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:05,270
You should be able
to walk into the Archives

121
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,751
and monitor us without a problem.

122
00:09:22,157 --> 00:09:24,076
Now that I am a Jedi,

123
00:09:24,357 --> 00:09:26,397
I can do that.

124
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:29,278
Good. You'll need these.

125
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,520
They're ear comlinks
so we can keep in communication.

126
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Hmm. The vault is in the library,

127
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:38,002
which backs onto
the communications center.

128
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:42,443
- There'll be swarms of Jedi nearby.
- We'll use that to our advantage.

129
00:09:42,484 --> 00:09:46,925
Even if you get into the vault,
how are you going to crack that safe?

130
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:50,966
Let me worry about the safe.
First things first.

131
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:58,289
Where do we start looking
for these intruders?

132
00:09:58,329 --> 00:09:59,568
What could they be after?

133
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,769
I doubt they've come to hijack starfighters.

134
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:04,731
What can they get here
that they can't get anywhere else?

135
00:10:04,852 --> 00:10:07,411
- Information.
- The Jedi transmitter codes.

136
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,973
Every piece of troop information
in one place.

137
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:13,453
- And it's all in the east tower.
- The east tower communications center.

138
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:14,494
I'll head there right away.

139
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:17,936
I'll monitor the perimeter defenses
from the central security station.

140
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:44,104
- Good afternoon, Master Enisence.
- Good afternoon, young one.

141
00:10:44,225 --> 00:10:46,105
May I be of assistance?

142
00:10:47,427 --> 00:10:51,067
No. No, thank you, my dear.
I don't want to bother you.

143
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,268
Oh, it wouldn't be a bother at all, Master.

144
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:57,188
Things are slow right now.
I could use something to do.

145
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,750
Oh, uh...

146
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,150
Cato, come in.
Cato, are you there yet?

147
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,311
Cato, come in!

148
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,392
Thank you. I'll be fine on my own.

149
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:09,713
You sure?

150
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:14,275
Look, youngling, I said I was fine.
Now let me go about my business.

151
00:11:15,076 --> 00:11:17,556
Can't do anything right these days.

152
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,880
- I'm in.
- It's about time.

153
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,880
Just tell us where to get in.

154
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,882
All right, there's a weak point in the shield
that Todo should be able to break through.

155
00:11:34,002 --> 00:11:35,562
I'm beaming him the coordinates now.

156
00:11:36,684 --> 00:11:38,003
Okay, I have got it.

157
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,844
I will jam the Temple's scanners.

158
00:11:41,365 --> 00:11:43,805
Let's see, it is around here somewhere.

159
00:11:48,888 --> 00:11:50,047
There!

160
00:11:51,648 --> 00:11:53,208
- In.
- You're welcome.

161
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,490
- What was that?
- The system is just recycling, sir.

162
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:04,012
Master, I'm in the tower. No intruders,
but something just happened.

163
00:12:04,093 --> 00:12:06,493
All the scanners were behaving strangely
for a moment.

164
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:08,894
Yes, something happened
to the system down here, too.

165
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:10,815
It cannot be a coincidence.

166
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,376
Arrived, the intruders have.

167
00:12:14,497 --> 00:12:16,816
But if they are not in the tower,
what are they after?

168
00:12:16,897 --> 00:12:19,618
The communications center, perhaps,
their target is.

169
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:22,339
They must be
in the central ventilation system.

170
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,099
Let me check the system.

171
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,300
You're right, there has been a disturbance.
It's near the top of the south tower.

172
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,902
- I'll meet you up there.
- On high alert, place the Temple.

173
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:42,345
The control board for the fan
should be on your left.

174
00:12:47,068 --> 00:12:48,587
All clear, sir.

175
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,471
Not quite. The fan you're passing through
has a security switch.

176
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:01,272
I do not see anything.
Besides, we've already gotten past the fan.

177
00:13:02,473 --> 00:13:03,473
Oh!

178
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:05,673
Todo! We're getting sucked into the fan!

179
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:09,194
- Turn it off!
- I do not know how!

180
00:13:09,276 --> 00:13:11,596
- Cato, do something!
- I've got it from here.

181
00:13:15,678 --> 00:13:16,677
Sorry.

182
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:36,244
Okay, Bane,
the next part is relatively simple.

183
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:38,205
Make your way down the shaft,
until you reach...

184
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:45,007
Excuse me. I don't mean to disturb you,
but the whole Temple is on high alert.

185
00:13:45,728 --> 00:13:47,447
Thank you.

186
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:08,735
This is it.
- Perfect. Let's go in.

187
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:11,977
No. Cato, come in. We're over the vault.

188
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,817
Give me a
moment to check out the security system.

189
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:19,259
- What's wrong with your voice?
- Change of plans. I'm the librarian now.

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,140
Hurry it up, Cato.
We can't stay hidden for long.

191
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:26,021
Well, looks like
this is where they broke in.

192
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:28,462
Fortunately we'll have
a less troublesome time.

193
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:39,266
The vault is filled with laser sensors
that go in every direction.

194
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,867
I'll try to deactivate the whole system
from here.

195
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:45,908
Just hurry. I can hear them.
They're looking for us in the vent system.

196
00:14:55,392 --> 00:14:59,833
- Great. Which way do you think they went?
- The communications center is this way.

197
00:14:59,873 --> 00:15:02,594
We'd better hurry
if we're going to catch them.

198
00:15:04,955 --> 00:15:08,956
- The Jedi are coming closer.
I've got it. Go in.

199
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:22,881
I don't think they came this way.

200
00:15:22,962 --> 00:15:26,682
Master Yoda, are you picking up
any other life signs in this quadrant?

201
00:15:26,763 --> 00:15:29,003
Deep in the Temple, the intruders are.

202
00:15:29,444 --> 00:15:31,163
How are they managing
to stay out of our way?

203
00:15:33,085 --> 00:15:37,246
Possible it is,
receiving assistance they are from inside.

204
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:39,327
Wonderful.

205
00:15:40,128 --> 00:15:43,769
Almost there. Are you done
deactivating those laser beams yet?

206
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:48,570
- We are good to go.
- Good. Start cutting through that wall.

207
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:52,131
This job just keeps getting
weirder and weirder.

208
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,774
Padawan, alert, you must be.
Sense deception, I do.

209
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:04,336
Posing as a Jedi the intruder is.

210
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,896
Find Master Jocasta you must.

211
00:16:11,859 --> 00:16:14,499
Bane,
the two Jedi have turned around

212
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,179
and are making their way towards you.

213
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:21,581
Who are you and what have you done
with Madame Jocasta?

214
00:16:21,623 --> 00:16:24,582
The same thing I'm going to do to you.

215
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,795
You may have Madame Jocasta's shape,
but not her skills.

216
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:08,037
- Todo, are you done yet?
- These things take time.

217
00:17:08,358 --> 00:17:12,839
- Some butler droid you turned out to be.
- I am a techno-service droid!

218
00:17:17,962 --> 00:17:19,721
Looks like you were right.

219
00:17:20,163 --> 00:17:23,922
Master Skywalker, I've captured
the impostor disguised as a Jedi.

220
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,403
She says the intruder
is in the holocron vault.

221
00:17:26,444 --> 00:17:29,365
A holocron is no good
without a Jedi to open it.

222
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:30,605
What are they up to?

223
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,806
They must be trying to gain access to
the communications center from the vault.

224
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:34,926
Let's get in there.

225
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:40,369
I'm not going to be able to do this
without a diagram. Cato, come in!

226
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:42,489
- Cato?
- What has happened?

227
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,330
Something's gone wrong.
Todo, is the hole finished?

228
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:47,731
- Yes. But...
- Go to the communications center.

229
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,812
- What?
- You heard me.

230
00:17:49,933 --> 00:17:52,693
Bane, the communications center
will be crawling with Jedi.

231
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:54,013
Why do I need to go in there?

232
00:17:54,134 --> 00:17:56,094
- Now!
- Okay! Okay!

233
00:18:22,464 --> 00:18:24,864
Quick! The communications center!
Let's go!

234
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,357
Oh! Uh...

235
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,837
Hey, guys!

236
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,720
I was just, um, testing the access hatch.
Works great.

237
00:19:12,201 --> 00:19:14,321
- Bomb!
- Bomb? What bomb?

238
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:15,761
Is there something going to blow up?

239
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:18,603
Bomb!

240
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,683
No! No, no, no, no, no...

241
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,609
Madame Librarian, are you okay?

242
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:44,331
I think I'm all right. We must call security.

243
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:56,095
Hmm. Our war operations
it was never about.

244
00:19:57,737 --> 00:20:00,858
Come on, changeling,
we have a new home for you.

245
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:04,058
What would someone want
with a holocron?

246
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,299
Wait.

247
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,380
Bolla Ropal.

248
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:12,861
- What did you say?
- Bolla Ropal.

249
00:20:12,942 --> 00:20:16,623
That's who Bane's next target is,
some Jedi.

250
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:22,945
- What's wrong? Who's Bolla Ropal?
- He is the keeper of the Kyber crystal,

251
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:25,746
the data on which
can only be read by holocrons.

252
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,146
What's on the crystal?

253
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,988
A list of every known Force-sensitive child
in the galaxy.

254
00:20:31,068 --> 00:20:34,669
The future younglings.
The future of the Jedi Order.

255
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,870
- We have to warn him.
- That's going to be hard to do.

256
00:20:37,951 --> 00:20:41,271
He's out of contact,
somewhere in the Devaron system.

257
00:20:41,352 --> 00:20:45,632
- Seek him out, you must.
- Ahsoka and I will set out immediately.

258
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:49,754
If this Cad Bane is still here on Coruscant,
I'll find him.
