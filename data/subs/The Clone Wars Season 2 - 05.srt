1
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,551
Counterattack!

2
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:19,992
With the clone army stretched

3
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:23,071
in a desperate attempt
to engage General Grievous' starfleet,

4
00:00:23,193 --> 00:00:25,392
Separatist planets
that were once thought secure

5
00:00:25,432 --> 00:00:28,031
are now rising up against the Republic.

6
00:00:28,152 --> 00:00:31,071
On Geonosis,
Separatist leader Poggle the Lesser,

7
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,830
safe in his newly ray-shielded factories,
creates thousands of terrible new weapons

8
00:00:35,912 --> 00:00:39,311
which march off the assembly line
against the outnumbered clone army.

9
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:44,151
The Jedi, resolute in their effort
to restore order to the Republic,

10
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:47,110
mount a massive invasion
to retake Geonosis

11
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:50,790
and shut down Poggle's factories of terror
once and for all.

12
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:55,510
I cannot believe we're back here again.

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,070
It is unfortunate.

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,789
The resistance from the native Geonosians
was stronger than we anticipated.

15
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,749
The same can be said
for their loyalty to Count Dooku.

16
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,909
A fact that is often overlooked.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,309
You're late.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,149
Sorry, Master, Ahsoka and I were
busy routing the Seppies near Dorin.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,909
My squadron alone had 55 kills.

20
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,789
Yeah, but mine had 76.

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,068
Showoff.

22
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,428
Well, I'm glad you two are
enjoying yourselves.

23
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:22,788
Hey, it's just a little
friendly competition, Master,

24
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:23,988
nothing to worry about.

25
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:27,188
What I worry about is the way
this war seems to be drawing out

26
00:01:27,268 --> 00:01:29,228
with no end in sight.

27
00:01:29,308 --> 00:01:33,187
Which is why it is crucial our invasion
of Geonosis meets with success.

28
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:36,387
Agreed. Ahsoka,
contact the Outer Rim Command.

29
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:37,747
We're ready for our briefing.

30
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:39,467
They're already waiting for us.

31
00:01:40,588 --> 00:01:41,827
Our ships are in position

32
00:01:41,908 --> 00:01:44,867
and we are ready to begin our campaign
against the Geonosians.

33
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:47,947
And what about Poggle?
Any report on his location?

34
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:51,627
It seems he's holed up
at the primary droid foundry here.

35
00:01:51,707 --> 00:01:54,066
The factory is protected
by a shield generator.

36
00:01:54,147 --> 00:01:57,146
Anakin, Ki-Adi and I
shall attempt a three-pronged attack

37
00:01:57,227 --> 00:02:00,786
through their defense lines
to a staging area just short of the shield.

38
00:02:00,866 --> 00:02:03,586
Once we've landed,
we shall knock out the shield generator.

39
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:05,626
That is our primary target.

40
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:09,586
Isn't it risky committing three generals
to one area of the attack?

41
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:13,425
If something went wrong,
we could be dealt a serious blow.

44
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:23,425
Of course. As always, I shall leave
the strategy to you, Master Jedi.

45
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,184
Our thanks, Chancellor.

46
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:27,025
May the Force be with you.

47
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:32,024
Good. Cody, these are the coordinates
for the rendezvous.

48
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:35,104
Yes, sir, when we hit the ground,
we'll create a perimeter there.

49
00:02:35,185 --> 00:02:37,864
Getting past their defenses here
will be the trick.

50
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:40,704
General Mundi will come across
the defensive lines from the north.

51
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,944
We will make our assault
through the middle.

52
00:02:43,024 --> 00:02:47,343
General Skywalker will make his attack
on the defensive lines from the south,

53
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,423
and we'll meet at the rendezvous point
at 0700 exactly.

54
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,822
If we meet with strong resistance

55
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:54,863
and are forced down
away from the landing zone,

56
00:02:54,984 --> 00:02:58,862
hold out until we join our forces
before attacking the shield generator.

57
00:02:58,903 --> 00:03:01,142
Their frontlines are heavily fortified.

58
00:03:01,263 --> 00:03:04,142
Look at that giant wall
with all the gun emplacements.

59
00:03:04,263 --> 00:03:06,382
That won't be easy to get past.

60
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,622
Don't worry.
We're not going anywhere near that.

61
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:12,422
Come, now. What happened
to all the enthusiasm I saw earlier?

62
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:13,902
Don't worry about us.

63
00:03:14,023 --> 00:03:16,981
You just make sure you get yourself
to that landing zone in one piece.

64
00:03:17,102 --> 00:03:20,141
Yes, I shall be waiting for you,
when you finally arrive.

65
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:23,781
Gentlemen, if you are quite finished,
we have a battle to begin.

66
00:03:24,422 --> 00:03:25,701
Quite right.

67
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,261
Cody, prep the gunships.
I'll meet you in the hangar.

68
00:03:28,302 --> 00:03:29,580
Yes, sir.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,259
No, sir, I wasn't involved
in the first assault on Geonosis.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,459
Well, you didn't miss much.
Last time, I was chained to a pole

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,019
and attacked
by several humongous monsters.

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,739
- That sounds entertaining.
- It was,

73
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,979
for the Geonosians.

74
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,776
- We all ready, Rex?
- Yes, sir.

75
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:47,536
General Kenobi is already underway.

76
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:50,056
Well, he's got a head start.
We'll have to catch up.

77
00:04:53,936 --> 00:04:55,136
Good luck, General.

78
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,016
There is no such thing as luck.

79
00:05:10,736 --> 00:05:12,135
Good thing those bugs can't aim.

80
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,254
The flak is too heavy.

81
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,653
We're down! Repeat, down!
Location five...

82
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:38,813
I just lost contact with Skywalker's team.

83
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:42,052
Come on!
Get up, we have to keep moving!

84
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:46,813
Here they come!

85
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,853
Watch it! Watch it!

86
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:58,612
They're falling back! Come on!

87
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:07,291
Get the tanks on the ground! Now!

88
00:06:10,692 --> 00:06:12,571
Cody, get the tanks down.
Come in, Cody!

89
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,570
Cody, come in! Get the tanks down!

90
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,211
Copy that. Pilot, begin landing sequence.

91
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,250
Copy that, Commander.
Have fun down there.

92
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:34,090
Move it! Move it!

93
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,969
Here they come!
Bugs incoming!

94
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,449
Man down! Man down!

95
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,649
General Kenobi, don't land!
The zone is hot!

96
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,849
But there's nowhere else to go!

97
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,848
We're hit! We're going down!

98
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:57,729
Brace yourselves!

99
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:10,807
Bogie, point three five.
- I'm on it, leader.

100
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:14,448
Nice work.

101
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,567
What are our losses, Captain?

102
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:20,287
We got hit pretty hard.

103
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,406
I think only Kenobi's forces made it
through the flak to the landing zone.

104
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:24,926
And what about Skywalker?

105
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:28,206
Captain Rex reported
they're still in the middle of a firefight.

106
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:29,726
Skywalker's tanks are gone

107
00:07:29,808 --> 00:07:32,687
and they're trying to contact
General Kenobi's forces for support.

108
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:34,726
In the meantime, they'll press on
to the rendezvous point.

109
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:38,246
Very well. Load the injured onto the tanks.

110
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:40,405
We'll make for that ridge.

111
00:07:40,607 --> 00:07:42,366
With any luck,
we can meet up with Skywalker

112
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:44,245
on his way to Kenobi's position.

113
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,405
Okay, Cody,
I'll speak with General Skywalker.

114
00:07:52,486 --> 00:07:55,805
Rex, what's the word?
Can Obi-Wan send support or not?

115
00:07:55,886 --> 00:07:56,965
I don't think so, sir.

116
00:07:57,046 --> 00:07:59,324
Cody says General Kenobi never reached
the landing site.

117
00:07:59,406 --> 00:08:01,004
They think his gunship got shot down.

118
00:08:01,086 --> 00:08:03,844
Great. The one time
I actually ask Obi-Wan for help,

119
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:05,004
he's nowhere to be found!

120
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,364
Well, what if something happened
to General Kenobi?

121
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,644
- He could be injured or...
- No time for that kind of talk.

122
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:12,044
Rex, we need to mobilize, now!

123
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:14,364
Get the men together.
We're going to rush the guns.

124
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:15,564
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:17,163
Ahsoka, you're with me.

126
00:08:17,245 --> 00:08:19,044
We need to give Rex cover
when we attack.

127
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,043
Got it, just give the word.

128
00:08:21,124 --> 00:08:23,003
Hey, I'm worried about him, too,

129
00:08:23,084 --> 00:08:25,203
but you have to keep your mind
in the here and now,

130
00:08:25,284 --> 00:08:27,723
otherwise we'll never be able
to help Obi-Wan.

131
00:08:30,124 --> 00:08:32,083
All here, sir.
- Ready? Now!

132
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:34,283
Go, go, go, go! Take them out!
Take them all out!

133
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:42,643
Not good. The bugs are splitting up.

134
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:45,162
- Boil, reporting as ordered sir.
- Waxer, reporting as ordered sir.

135
00:08:45,243 --> 00:08:46,882
We've got a downed gunship
five clicks east.

136
00:08:46,963 --> 00:08:48,082
We believe it's General Kenobi's.

137
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,282
I need you to get out there
and check for survivors.

138
00:08:50,362 --> 00:08:51,881
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Sir, yes, sir!

139
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:09,280
- Why do we always get the fun missions?
- Oh, this isn't the fun part.

140
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,161
Getting back to the square is the fun part.

141
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:19,400
Waxer, Boil, am I glad to see you!
Trapper and I are the only ones still alive.

142
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:20,720
Good to see you, sir!

143
00:09:20,801 --> 00:09:23,560
Commander Cody has established
the square just beyond this position.

144
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,279
The bugs are on the move
and trying to surround us as we speak, sir.

145
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:31,040
They've got the General.

146
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,639
AT-TE 636, lay down cover fire
at point three five.

147
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:45,358
Take it down! Take it down!

148
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:55,638
- Are you injured, General?
- No, no, nothing too serious.

149
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:59,317
- What's the situation here?
- We've got no air cover.

150
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:01,478
Two generals on the ground
beyond our position.

151
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:03,317
And a mess of bugs surrounding us.

152
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:05,757
The enemy was more than prepared
for our attack, sir.

153
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:07,517
They knew our every move.

154
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,037
Well, I'm sure General Skywalker
and General Mundi

155
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:11,516
will make it to our position.

156
00:10:11,638 --> 00:10:14,836
We just have to make sure we're still here
when they arrive.

157
00:10:35,956 --> 00:10:39,235
Negative, Captain. We will be unable
to provide any air support at this time.

158
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:40,915
I understand that, sir,

159
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,595
but we have three attack forces
on the ground

160
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,355
and only one at the landing zone.

161
00:10:44,516 --> 00:10:49,155
This is a planetary-wide invasion, Captain.
If I divert resources to your position,

162
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:51,795
it will mean sacrificing
other areas of the campaign.

163
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:55,074
All we can do at this time
is help you find General Skywalker.

164
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,034
All right, sir. I'll report to the General.
Commander Jet, out.

165
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:00,754
Give me every fighter you can scrape up.

166
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,754
Have you located
General Skywalker's position?

167
00:11:03,995 --> 00:11:06,553
We think he's somewhere
along the eastern barrier.

168
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:09,273
That's not a barrier, it's a fortress.

169
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:17,873
Gentlemen, tackle...

170
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:23,672
Well, this is another fine mess
you've gotten us into.

171
00:11:23,754 --> 00:11:25,992
What? Hey, it's not my fault!

172
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,153
You were supposed to study
the holomaps!

173
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:29,592
I did!

174
00:11:29,674 --> 00:11:33,032
Remember when I reminded you
about the giant wall,

175
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:37,352
and you said, "Don't worry, Snips,
we won't be anywhere near that"?

176
00:11:37,433 --> 00:11:39,311
Just get ready to climb!

177
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:43,151
General, I left a squad to protect the tanks.

178
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:45,791
Are you sure this is
the shortest way to the landing zone?

179
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:50,151
No, I'm not sure, Commander.
All I can do is trust my instincts.

180
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:05,710
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I have a wing vibration up ahead.

181
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,469
Don't stop! We must push on! Forward!

182
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,389
- So, what's the plan, General?
- Just keep us covered, Rex.

183
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,868
There's too much laser fire
for all of us to make the climb.

184
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,228
Ahsoka and I will handle this.
Just be ready when that wall comes down.

185
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:27,225
How many droids
have you shut down so far?

186
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,865
- Twenty-five.
- Ah, you're falling behind. Let's go!

187
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,384
Focus on the droids on top of the wall!

188
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:57,383
Man down!

189
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:28,062
Look for a hatch. We need to put
the explosives inside the wall.

190
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,662
Found one!

191
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:55,660
Hey, did you get them?

192
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:57,460
- Catch!
- Huh?

193
00:14:58,181 --> 00:14:59,140
No!

194
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,820
- Come on, Rex.
- Up and away!

195
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,779
Help!

196
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,258
- Next time, just tell me to jump.
- Now, where's the fun in that?

197
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:37,217
- Come on, we can't keep Obi-Wan waiting.
You heard him, lads. Let's go!

198
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:49,897
We're almost through.
Bring in the flamethrowers!

199
00:16:00,137 --> 00:16:01,176
Look! What's that?

200
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:11,696
Master Mundi, do you read me?

201
00:16:11,977 --> 00:16:13,415
We're here, Skywalker.

202
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:16,696
We took a slight detour that put us
out of communications for a bit.

203
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:18,855
This has been a day for detours, Master.

204
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,175
Indeed, but now the road is clear.

205
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:24,295
I can see the landing zone.
It does not look good.

206
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,655
Can you get me Admiral Yularen?

207
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,414
Admiral, we're at the breaking point.

208
00:16:32,495 --> 00:16:34,294
You've got to get some fighters
down here.

209
00:16:34,376 --> 00:16:37,694
You are in luck, General Skywalker.
I have one squadron available.

210
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,614
Retreat! Go! Go! Go!

211
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:59,213
Fire through! Make every shot
count! Give it all you got!

212
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,612
Reinforcements!
The reinforcements have arrived!

213
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:17,452
Go, go, go! Move it! Move it!
Hurry up, lads! Let's go!

214
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,571
Hurry! Hurry! Here they are.

215
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,131
Move it! Move it!

216
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,451
Master Kenobi!

217
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:32,410
- Well, what happened to you?
- I might ask you the same question.

218
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:36,250
Our combined forces should be enough
to destroy the shield generator.

219
00:17:36,332 --> 00:17:39,690
Anakin, you'll need to take a small squad
through the shield,

220
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:42,490
as close as you can get
to their gun emplacements.

221
00:17:42,571 --> 00:17:45,410
From there, you'll be able
to temporarily jam their scanners

222
00:17:45,491 --> 00:17:48,170
so they are unable
to target the incoming tanks.

223
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,330
Once the tanks knock out the shield,

224
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:54,170
Master Mundi can bring
the rest of the troops in with the gunships.

225
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,729
Consider it done, Master.

226
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,889
All units are in position, sir.

227
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,889
Tell Skywalker to start the attack.

228
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,568
Begin the attack.

229
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:50,486
Let's jam their scanners.
Droid poppers, ready.

230
00:18:57,087 --> 00:19:01,005
- Looks like it's working.
- It won't last long. Bring up the tanks!

231
00:19:41,684 --> 00:19:43,563
So, Master, what was your total?

232
00:19:44,724 --> 00:19:47,203
- Not now, Ahsoka.
- Come on!

233
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:49,282
Are you afraid you lost this time?

234
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:52,243
Fine. Fifty-five, that's my count. And you?

235
00:19:54,164 --> 00:19:56,482
Sixty. Looks like I won.

236
00:19:57,843 --> 00:20:00,802
Yeah, but I called in the air strike. Tie!

237
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:02,802
You're impossible!

238
00:20:03,283 --> 00:20:04,402
I'll never understand

239
00:20:04,443 --> 00:20:07,842
how you can simplify these battles
into some kind of game.

240
00:20:10,323 --> 00:20:13,441
Well, take care of yourselves.
I expect to see both of you back here

241
00:20:13,523 --> 00:20:15,801
by the time I've destroyed
the main factory.

242
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:17,361
We shall do our best.

243
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:20,641
- Sixty-five, Skywalker.
- I'm sorry?

244
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,880
My total. Sixty-five.

245
00:20:23,482 --> 00:20:24,761
So what do I win?

246
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,600
My everlasting respect, Master Mundi.

247
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:33,160
Oh.

248
00:20:33,201 --> 00:20:37,200
That is a gift Anakin rarely bestows,
I assure you.
