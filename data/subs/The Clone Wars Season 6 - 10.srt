1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,540
A long awaited truth!

2
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,620
A distress signal has been received
at the Jedi Temple

3
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,510
and Master Plo Koon has been
dispatched to investigate its origin.

4
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,710
The signal is from a ship
thought to be lost

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,550
and was last known to be
in the possession of a Jedi Master

6
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:33,510
who was killed long ago.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,850
Can anyone hear us?
Come in please.

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,060
We're not getting anything over here.

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,730
We're off. We must be way off.

10
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,060
Negative. It is here.

11
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,230
The data specifically states.
It has got to be.

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,520
We've scanned the area three times.

13
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,190
This is a wasteland. There's nothing.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,950
All of our information
pinpoints it is here.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,680
I don't know
what to tell you, sir.

16
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,260
We're getting no visual,
and no recognition on the scanner.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,130
We must locate the source of the signal,
Commander, press on!

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,140
Wait, I think
I've found something.

19
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,710
It's very faint, sir.

20
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,380
That is it.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,260
Halt! Halt!
Halt all vehicles!

22
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,390
The hull
shows substantial scoring and wear.

23
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:59,690
Whenever it crashed, it wasn't recently.

24
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,680
General Plo, the scans check out,
it's a T-6 Shuttle all right,

25
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,530
serial number 7-7-5-5-1 -9.

26
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,070
I want the entire area cleared.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,820
We're taking everything
back to Coruscant.

28
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,240
- Everything?
- Everything!

29
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,270
Then it is the lost ship
of Master Sifo-Dyas?

30
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,350
I found this at the crash site.

31
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:51,100
Hmm. The lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas it is.
Never found when he died it was.

32
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,810
Master Kenobi, remind the Council
of what you discovered

33
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,190
regarding Master Sifo-Dyas before
the start of the Clone War.

34
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,950
My investigation of the bounty hunter
Jango Fett led to Kamino.

35
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,990
The Kaminoans recounted
that it was Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas

36
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,450
who ordered the production
of a Clone Army.

37
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,620
Without the consent of the Council
or the Senate he did this.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,500
Prior to the blockade of Naboo,

39
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,420
Sifo-Dyas sat on this Council until
we judged his ideas to be too extreme.

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Indeed.

41
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,390
He said he foresaw a great conflict,

42
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,470
and that the Republic would need
to raise an army.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,140
At the time the Council
rejected those ideas.

44
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, it's not the first time
we've been wrong recently, is it?

45
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,820
The creation of the Clone Army,
kept secret from us Sifo-Dyas did.

46
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,820
How this was done we know not.

47
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,920
Yet now, a new piece
of the puzzle we have,

48
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:49,620
perhaps clarity, it will bring us, yes.

49
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:59,340
Our records definitively state
that Master Sifo-Dyas died on Felucia.

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,970
In the fifth quarter, a small skirmish
broke out between the native Felucians.

51
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,090
Master Sifo-Dyas was assigned

52
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,510
to negotiate peace talks
between the tribes.

53
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,480
The negotiations failed
and Sifo-Dyas was killed.

54
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
What became of his body?

55
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,650
I am afraid I cannot answer that.

56
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,360
Any further information on this incident
has been sealed.

57
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,160
On whose authority?

58
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,990
By the office
of the Supreme Chancellor.

59
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,450
Thank you, Madame Jocasta.

60
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,080
To Felucia
Skywalker and Kenobi will go.

61
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,590
A trail long cold it is, yet still
lay hidden there a clue might be.

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,650
Question all who were present the day
of Sifo-Dyas's death, you must.

63
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,680
And what of the sealed file?

64
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,140
Speak with the Chancellor
personally I will,

65
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,490
to see what part in this the politics
of the Senate have played.

66
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,990
Master Sifo-Dyas?

67
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,780
Forgive me, I'm afraid I am not familiar
with that name.

68
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,080
Died some time ago he did on Felucia.

69
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,120
Investigating his death we are,

70
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,210
and yet sealed by the Chancellor's
office some of his files were.

71
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,840
And what is the nature
of your investigation?

72
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:28,340
A Jedi matter it is, Chancellor.
Add to your troubles I would not.

73
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,140
That is very considerate, Master Yoda.
May I at least ask when Master...

74
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,390
Sifo-Dyas.

75
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,400
Yes, Master Sifo-Dyas,
may I ask when he was killed?

76
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,860
Over 10 years ago it was.

77
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,860
Well, that explains it.
I'm afraid this was before my time.

78
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,740
Ten years ago, I was a humble Senator
serving the planet Naboo.

79
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,040
Only my predecessor,
Chancellor Valorum,

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,670
would have the answers you seek.

81
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:03,130
I suggest you speak with him.

82
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,210
Very well. Thank you, Chancellor.

83
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,430
I have spoken with
the tribal leaders on Felucia.

84
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,100
They use a very ancient dialect
which is hard to understand

85
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,440
but from what I can make out,

86
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,980
when Master Sifo-Dyas died,
he was not alone.

87
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,070
There was a second Jedi
here with him.

88
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,450
And the name of this second Jedi?

89
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,620
Either I don't understand them
or they won't say. It's hard to tell.

90
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,080
This is a primitive people
we are dealing with.

91
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,830
After his death,
they cremated Sifo-Dyas's body

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,760
and I'm afraid the trail goes cold there.

93
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,850
Did you have any success
with the Chancellor?

94
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,670
As much success as usual,
I am afraid.

95
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,180
Pointed in another direction I am now,
to speak with Valorum I go.

96
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,780
It's been a long time, my friend.
What can I do for you?

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,790
A file sealed by your administration
the Jedi Council has come across.

98
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,910
The subject of the file?

99
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,620
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.

100
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,710
Sifo-Dyas?

101
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,430
When I was Chancellor,

102
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,750
I sent him on a mission to deal
with a flare up in the Pyke syndicate.

103
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,420
The Pykes?

104
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,550
A powerful part of the spice cartel.

105
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,800
Their criminal activities
had allowed them

106
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:38,720
to almost completely control
the production of raw spice

107
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,890
used to create a powerful drug.

108
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,060
We were facing a full scale war
underneath the surface of Coruscant.

109
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,480
Knowing of his expertise
on the Underworld,

110
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,860
I contacted Master Sifo-Dyas
to stabilize the problem.

111
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,410
Know of this, the Jedi Council did not.

112
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,660
The Senate Committee
assigned to the matter

113
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,170
feared that open discussions
with such a criminal element

114
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,330
could legitimize their activities

115
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,000
and give strength to opposition leaders
within the bureaucracy.

116
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,380
Secrecy was our only choice.

117
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,510
The timing of these negotiations,
when were they to take place?

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,680
I cannot remember the precise timing,
I'm afraid. It was so long ago.

119
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,390
I do remember that
the talks were postponed

120
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,320
not long after our delegates
arrived on Oba Diah.

121
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,610
Something about a flare up
of activity on Felucia.

122
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:37,950
Yes, intervene on Felucia,
the Council insisted Sifo-Dyas did,

123
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,750
but tell me, Chancellor, who was
the other Jedi you sent with Sifo-Dyas?

124
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,540
Other Jedi? I know of no other Jedi.

125
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,800
There was only my personal aide,
Silman, and Sifo-Dyas.

126
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,270
I'm afraid they were
both killed on Felucia.

127
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,720
Personal aid? Silman?

128
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,780
Tell me, why do the Jedi
look for Sifo-Dyas?

129
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,690
What trail are they following?

130
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:13,610
If there is a trail, it is unknown to me.

131
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,820
Retrace your steps,
find this loose end, and eliminate it.

132
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,380
I understand what is at stake, my Lord.

133
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,500
I will go to the Pykes and take care of it.

134
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:32,670
This is not the first time you have
proven to be clumsy, Lord Tyranus.

135
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,170
- You know the price of failure.

136
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,070
The Felucians know
nothing of this Silman.

137
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,950
No one there seems
to know anything about him.

138
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,900
What's that symbol he's wearing?

139
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:57,070
The symbol of the high Chancellor
before the war, Chancellor Valorum.

140
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,780
So, we have one dead Jedi with
no physical evidence of a body,

141
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,330
a second Jedi who appeared
on Felucia that we have no record of,

142
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,910
and now this Silman, personal attache
to the Chancellor, is missing?

143
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,090
Yet, now we know Sifo-Dyas
and Silman were both on Oba Diah,

144
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:15,750
according to Chancellor Valorum.

145
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,470
The crashed shuttle I found was located
on a moon which orbits the Pyke planet.

146
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,720
Hmm. To the Pykes you must go,
to Oba Diah, yes.

147
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:43,930
I cannot remember the last time
a Jedi came here.

148
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,800
Many years it has been.

149
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,810
Funny you should say that.

150
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,230
We're looking for a Jedi that got
lost here. His name is Sifo-Dyas.

151
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:58,480
Oh, the Jedi Sifo-Dyas was here,

152
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,150
but that was a long time ago.

153
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:07,910
Master Sifo-Dyas's ship was found
crashed on a moon orbiting this world.

154
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,000
What you found, we know nothing of.

155
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,050
Would the Jedi like
to join us for a refreshment?

156
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,880
The Pykes offer is kindly accepted.

157
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,810
To friendship.

158
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,940
- Friendship.
- Friendship.

159
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,230
What an interesting necklace that is.

160
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,440
May I have a look?

161
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:50,200
Perhaps the Pykes have taken
enough of the Jedi's time.

162
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,960
Oh, no, no. It's no bother at all,

163
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,250
the Jedi are happy
to know all the Pykes' secrets.

164
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,000
We have no quarrel with the Jedi.

165
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,960
Maybe you should tell us
why you're wearing

166
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,590
the crest of the Chancellor's
personal advisor?

167
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,180
I am confused.

168
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:14,060
Is the Jedi looking for a Jedi Master
or someone else?

169
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,190
Stop playing games.
Sifo-Dyas was traveling with an advisor.

170
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,860
They were sent here
to negotiate with you.

171
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,240
Well, it looks like you have finally
put the pieces together.

172
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,910
The man you are looking for is here.

173
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:48,550
The Pykes wanted to gain an advantage
over the other crime families,

174
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,550
so alliances were made.

175
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,140
One alliance was with
a man named Tyranus.

176
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,890
I've heard that name before,

177
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,270
Jango Fett mentioned it during
my Kamino investigation.

178
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,860
Tyranus wanted Sifo-Dyas dead,

179
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,110
the Pykes were well paid
to shoot down his ship.

180
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:13,990
However, any man that is willing to pay
to have a Jedi killed is dangerous,

181
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,740
and unpredictable.

182
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:22,210
The Pykes inspected the crash,
to retrieve the Jedi's body for proof.

183
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:29,170
But, with the dead Jedi,
the Pykes found another, still alive.

184
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,550
Silman, the Chancellor's aide?

185
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,100
The Pykes gave Tyranus Sifo-Dyas,

186
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,060
but the Pykes did not
tell Tyranus of Silman.

187
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,270
The Pykes needed insurance.

188
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,810
Insurance?

189
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:50,110
Yes, and now the Pykes can bargain.

190
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,700
We give you Silman, you forget about
the Pykes' treachery against the Jedi.

191
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,430
Hello?

192
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,020
- Who's there?
- We are Jedi sent to find you.

193
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,600
Jedi?

194
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,770
To find me?

195
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,280
Why me?

196
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,900
I was betrayed, forgotten. Long ago.

197
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:32,570
No one knew you were alive.

198
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,320
Quick. Maybe you have some food.

199
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,870
Have you any food?

200
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,210
Of course.

201
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,710
Oh!

202
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,590
Thank you, my friend. A supply bar!

203
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,250
Mmm! Mmm! Delicious.

204
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,470
You see, I was so frightened
I would have nothing to serve.

205
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,100
Serve?

206
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,810
My babies, they get so angry
when I have nothing to serve.

207
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,890
We might have a problem here.

208
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,410
Tyranus, you are no longer
welcome here.

209
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,250
I think you've been cooped up
in here too long, old man.

210
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,460
We've come to take you home.

211
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,390
Home? No, no, this is my home!
I can't leave my friends.

212
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,220
You were traveling with
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.

213
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,060
Tell us what happed to him.

214
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,100
Sifo-Dyas?

215
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,310
He died.

216
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,360
Died. Died. Died. Died.

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,730
Tricked we were.

218
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,330
The Pykes are not to be trusted.
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no.

219
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,450
But the Pykes were not the ones.
No, no, the Pykes were not the reason.

220
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,920
Who was responsible?

221
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,550
Someone powerful...

222
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,300
Someone who wanted to be Sifo-Dyas!

223
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:34,570
Why?

224
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,610
All is deception.

225
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,740
Can't you see... Because... Because...

226
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,970
Dooku! For once you actually came
to do your own dirty work.

227
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,350
Sometimes things
are just that important.

228
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:27,870
Ah!

229
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:59,860
You have no business
left with the Pykes, Tyranus.

230
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,030
Tyranus?
You are the man called Tyranus?

231
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,530
I told you everything
you needed to know

232
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:09,830
on Geonosis
all those years ago, Kenobi.

233
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:13,500
You should have joined me.
Sifo-Dyas understood.

234
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,430
He saw the future,
that is why he helped me.

235
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,270
You lie!

236
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,930
Minister Lom, if you are going
to help us, now is the time.

237
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,220
Kill Tyranus!

238
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,340
I'll give you a push!

239
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,630
Know now we do,

240
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,890
that guide the creation of the clones
from the beginning, Dooku did.

241
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:50,970
Hmm.

242
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,350
Our enemy created an army for us.

243
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:58,480
If this was known,
public confidence in the war effort,

244
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,110
the Jedi and the Republic would vanish.

245
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,860
There would be mass chaos.

246
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,240
Cover up this discovery we must.

247
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,870
No one,
not even the Chancellor may know.

248
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:14,500
Valiant men,
the clones have proven to be,

249
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,790
saved my life and yours
they have many times.

250
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,850
Believe in them we must,
win the war swiftly we must,

251
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,010
before our enemy's designs
reach completion,

252
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,930
whatever they may be.

253
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,720
Are you sure
we are taking the right path?

254
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,320
The right path, no.

255
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,730
The only path, yes.

256
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:46,150
Designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith,
this web is.

257
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,950
For now, play his game we must.
