1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,200
Jedi mystery!

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,920
A lightsaber was found
on the moon of Oba Diah,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,710
belonging to Sifo-Dyas,

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:28,960
the Jedi responsible for
the creation of the clone army.

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,970
The Jedi have learned
that before the start of the war.

6
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,130
Count Dooku murdered Sifo-Dyas

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,470
and skillfully manipulated the Republic
into the galactic conflict

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,010
intending for the Jedi to fight
with the clones at their side.

9
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,230
Now, as the Jedi Council meets to
discuss the purpose of this deception,

10
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:51,980
Master Yoda meditates deep into
the Force in search of answers.

11
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,240
Yoda.

12
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,340
Hear you I do.

13
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,450
Who are you?

14
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,080
My imagination it must be.

15
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,960
No.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,000
It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn.

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,340
That cannot be. Dead you are.

18
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:21,440
No. I am part of the living Force, Yoda.

19
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,530
Impossible.

20
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,450
I am not sure this Council is admitting
how grave a situation we are in.

21
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,920
What are you saying?

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,960
That Dooku is not the Sith Lord,
merely an apprentice.

23
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,790
That, like many things,
remains unclear.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,300
Master Yoda, your thoughts
on these revelations?

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,630
Mmm? Oh.

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,260
Oh, yes, yes.

27
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,260
Forgive me, deep in thought I was.

28
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,240
You were saying?

29
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Master Ki-Adi-Mundi is worried.

30
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,940
Yes, worried we all should be.

31
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,990
Lies and mistrust surround us
in the Senate

32
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,410
and perhaps even within these walls.

33
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,080
Hmm.

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,290
On the precipice we are. Yes.

35
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,870
The growing dark side
endangers us all.

36
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,590
Excuse me, everyone.

37
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,260
Master Kenobi,
may I speak with you in private?

38
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,720
Of course.

39
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,230
There is great turmoil
within Master Yoda.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
Yes. We all sensed it.

41
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,400
For something to affect Yoda
this deeply concerns me.

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,130
We must keep an eye on our old friend.

43
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,660
The war has taxed all of us to our limit.

44
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,460
I suppose we're just surprised
that Master Yoda has one.

45
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,000
I hope it's that simple.

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,550
But I feel the shadow of something
greater on our horizon.

47
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,730
Yoda.

48
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:43,780
Oh! Master Yoda.
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

49
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,240
Is everything okay?

50
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,000
Encountered something difficult I have.

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Difficult? For you, Master?

52
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:56,340
Spoke with Master Qui-Gon Jinn
on Mortis did you not?

53
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,670
Yes, so did Obi-Wan.

54
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,130
However, since he's dead,
we don't think it was actually him.

55
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,350
Rather an illusion. A mind trick
formed out of our memories.

56
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,470
That's what Obi-Wan believes.

57
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,560
Why do you ask?

58
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,940
Perhaps nothing it is.

59
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,440
Everything that we know about
the Force tells us

60
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,360
that an individual retaining their identity
after death is impossible.

61
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,580
Everything that we know, yes.

62
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,870
But what about what we know not?
Hmm?

63
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,080
Master Yoda,

64
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,790
are you suggesting that
you have spoken with Master Qui-Gon?

65
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,170
Suggest this I am not.

66
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,170
Rest I need. Yes, rest.

67
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,420
Then speak with the Council I shall.

68
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,560
Sense something that I have not before.

69
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,520
Impossible it seems.

70
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,890
Trust my feelings I do not.

71
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,900
The voice I hear
does not come from within,

72
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,480
but speaks from beyond.

73
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:09,580
Know I must if I am alone,
or if any of you can hear it as well.

74
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,780
Then together we shall meditate.

75
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,780
Hmm...

76
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,450
Hear the voice I did not.

77
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,580
I also sensed nothing.

78
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,930
Answers, we will not find.

79
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,920
Tired I am. Rest I must.

80
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,730
We have to consider that
this may be a deception by the Sith.

81
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,520
Surely you are not suggesting.

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,270
Master Yoda is susceptible
to such manipulation?

83
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:23,560
Master Yoda, you are older
and wiser than any living Jedi,

84
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,690
but this does not mean you are beyond
the corruption of the dark side.

85
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,400
Agree I do.

86
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,610
A possibility we must consider it is.

87
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,490
Clouded so much of our vision
the dark side has.

88
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,330
Deceived I may be.

89
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,640
All I can tell you is
I have scanned Master Yoda three times

90
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,510
and I find nothing wrong with him.

91
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,810
I am not an expert on his biology,

92
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,350
but from my point of view,
he is in perfect health.

93
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,770
And his mind?

94
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,690
No signs of any degeneration.

95
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,950
This section of the brain
is particularly active.

96
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,950
More than I have seen in any other Jedi.

97
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,120
Probably what happens when
you approach 900 years old.

98
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,960
I think we are overlooking
an obvious thread.

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,420
Which is?

100
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,830
Count Dooku was Yoda's apprentice.

101
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,960
And Count Dooku
has fallen to the dark side.

102
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,760
All of us have apprenticed
to Master Yoda.

103
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,380
He cannot be held accountable
for Dooku's descent.

104
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,470
But they are connected. Profoundly.

105
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,100
Whoever the Sith Lord is,

106
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,810
he may be using this relationship
as a direct link to Yoda.

107
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,030
Impossible.

108
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,810
Are you so sure?

109
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,020
If the Sith Lord wanted to
attack the Jedi Order from within,

110
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,900
Master Yoda would be
the perfect choice.

111
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,240
I fear we are
more vulnerable than we think.

112
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,670
I would like to suggest something.

113
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,700
A deprivation ritual.

114
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,710
It is a dangerous procedure,
but one that will without question

115
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,790
allow Yoda to go to
the source of this voice.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Whatever, whoever it may be.

117
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,510
I am sorry to bother you,
but the Chancellor's requesting

118
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,130
that Master Yoda attend
an emergency meeting.

119
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,050
I will go.

120
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,430
What about the treatment?

121
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:21,310
Ask Master Yoda what he wants to do.

122
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,430
Only he can decide now.

123
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,160
The chamber works to
deprive the patient

124
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,620
of any stimulation except from within.

125
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,370
Master Yoda will be taken into
an induced meditation.

126
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,170
This allows the patient to go deeper

127
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,540
than anything we can achieve
by ourselves.

128
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,840
Master Yoda, you don't have to do this.

129
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,170
Solve this puzzle I will.

130
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,880
But it could be
more dangerous than you realize.

131
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,720
The danger is not to know the truth.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
See clearly I must.

133
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,470
Help this will.

134
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:14,610
Life signs are normal.

135
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,610
Beginning the procedure.

136
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,630
What are you doing?

137
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,430
By reducing the flow of oxygen

138
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,470
the body will be forced
into a deep meditative state.

139
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,640
It will take him
as close to death as possible.

140
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,890
I don't like this.

141
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:53,520
Yoda, no.
This is not the way.

142
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,410
Come to Dagobah.
The answers you seek are here.

143
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,780
But why?

144
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,540
You must complete what I could not.

145
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,540
His vital signs are dropping too low.

146
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,550
- But the test...
- I want him out of there now!

147
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,340
Master Yoda!
Master Yoda, wake up!

148
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,390
Come back to us!

149
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,800
Speak of this to no one.
Trust no one.

150
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,550
Come to Dagobah, alone!

151
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,520
Master Yoda!
Master Yoda, wake up!

152
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,730
Welcome back, old friend.

153
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,230
- Thought we lost you there.
- Hmm.

154
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,400
Speaking to the dead I was.

155
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,700
Friends long gone.

156
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,740
Good friends.

157
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,660
How did the procedure go?

158
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,830
We're not certain.

159
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,380
Yoda seems to be under the impression

160
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,250
he contacted the dead
and spoke with them.

161
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,010
What are your thoughts
on this, Doctor?

162
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:03,130
Medically, Yoda seems fine,

163
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:06,180
but I cannot speak
to his spiritual balance.

164
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,930
What Yoda claims is not possible.

165
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,730
As far as we know.

166
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,020
The dead are part of the Cosmic Force
and lose their individuality.

167
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,820
I fear Yoda is under attack by the Sith,

168
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,030
though how remains unknown to us.

169
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,360
Until what's going on is clear,

170
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,450
I want temple guards
placed in the medical bay.

171
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,050
I'm prescribing nothing but bed rest
for you now, Master Yoda.

172
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,340
I will leave you two alone.

173
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,320
You asked for me, Master?

174
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,310
Yes, friends, we are? Hmm?

175
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,650
Of course.

176
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,270
A choice you must make.
Worried for you I am.

177
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,190
Why is that?

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,990
Do something for me you must.
Blamed you will be.

179
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,200
What? What must I do?

180
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,830
Help me to escape. Yes.

181
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,250
Escape?

182
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:13,660
But you're not in prison.

183
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,330
No, hmm? Perhaps.

184
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,460
But perhaps I am.

185
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,760
Already, all around us the cage may be.

186
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,550
A journey I must make, alone.

187
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,930
The Council will not want you
to travel at all, alone even less.

188
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,440
Disobeying the Council,
your expertise is,

189
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,520
that is why I ask for your help.

190
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,320
It is the spontaneity you find so easily
which others do not.

191
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,820
That is what sets you apart.

192
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:48,830
Now, a walk you will take me on.
Come, come.

193
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,910
Where are you going?

194
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,210
Some fresh air I require.

195
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,210
It's okay, he's with me.
I'll watch him.

196
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,470
I hope I don't regret this.

197
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,910
Hey, Artoo, I have a mission for you.

198
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Doctor Nema is going to notice
Yoda is missing any minute now.

199
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,110
Get him to his ship as fast as possible
and get him out of here.

200
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,760
Where's Master Yoda?
What have you done?

201
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,220
Hey, for once, none of this was my idea.

202
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,780
Yes, stay with the ship you may.

203
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:51,150
This task, for me alone it is.

204
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,350
Here I am.

205
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,140
Ready for my next instruction,
Master Qui-Gon.

206
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,330
Yoda, my old friend,
you have come at last.

207
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,320
Qui-Gon Jinn... Really you, it is?

208
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,700
It is.

209
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,360
Losing my mind I am not?

210
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,530
No, my friend. No.

211
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,080
Why have you brought me here?

212
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,250
Follow the light,
the light will be your guide.

213
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,530
Strong this planet is with the Force.

214
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,900
It is one of the purest places
in the galaxy.

215
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,530
How are you here?

216
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,410
I am a manifestation of the Force.

217
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:24,250
A Force that consists of two parts.

218
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,000
Living beings generate
the Living Force

219
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:30,600
which in turn powers the well spring
that is the Cosmic Force.

220
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,180
Show yourself, can you?

221
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:45,230
I cannot.
My training was incomplete.

222
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,850
All energy from the living Force,

223
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,440
from all things that have ever lived,
feeds into the Cosmic Force,

224
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,160
binding everything and communicating
to us through the midi-chlorians.

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,370
Because of this I can
speak to you now.

226
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,950
See the future, you can?

227
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,540
I exist where there is no future or past.

228
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,420
Know you who the Sith Lord is?

229
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,380
I can only show you a place where
the answers will be revealed to you.

230
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,030
Be wary,

231
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,290
give power to that which you fear
and it will show itself to you.

232
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,750
- No.

233
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,010
- No, no, no. You will die!

234
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,550
Sidious...

235
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,560
Sidious...

236
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,650
Join me. There is no other way.

237
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,450
No.

238
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,940
Yoda, come back to us. Yoda.

239
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:43,960
Such darkness. Such evil.

240
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,700
When will this happen?

241
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,160
It is happening right now.
It has always been happening.

242
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,040
With each day the Clone War wages,
evil is growing in its power.

243
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,750
What you felt in the cave

244
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,170
is merely a portion of what
the dark side now holds.

245
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,680
Such power.

246
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,010
Any hope that the Jedi
can prevail, is there?

247
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,470
There is always hope, my friend.

248
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,890
Though it often comes
in forms not looked for.

249
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,440
The key is knowing how to see it
and seizing that opportunity.

250
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:23,120
I have been tasked
with guiding you forward.

251
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,910
There can be many outcomes.
But your path is clear, Yoda.

252
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,500
You have been chosen,
as I was before you.

253
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,500
For what chosen am I?

254
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:42,130
You will learn to preserve
your Life Force,

255
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,730
and so, manifest a consciousness

256
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,890
which will allow you to commune
with the living after death.

257
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,640
How?

258
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,140
Dark times are ahead
and forces of light must remain.

259
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,520
This is the path of only a few Jedi.

260
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:05,030
You will travel to one of the origins
of all life in the galaxy.

261
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,570
This place is where?

262
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,370
The Force will be your guide.

263
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,950
Goodbye, my friend.

264
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,170
Yes, my friend, all right I am.

265
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,050
No, back to Coruscant,
we are not going yet.

266
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,650
Afraid, only begun our long journey has.
