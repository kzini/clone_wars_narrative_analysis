1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,820
<i>The clone Starfleet
is under siege.</i>

2
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,415
<i>Dozens of Republic warships have been
destroyed in merciless surprise attacks</i>

3
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,092
<i>that leave no survivors.</i>

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,899
<i>Rumors spread of
a terrible new Separatist weapon.</i>

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,655
<i>In the face of growing fear,
the Jedi Council sends Master Plo Koon</i>

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,176
<i>to hunt down the menace
before it strikes again.</i>

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,290
The enemy ship
has reduced its speed, General.

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:51,133
They must have realized
we are tracking them.

9
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,899
We're tracking three Republic cruisers.
What should we do?

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,936
Jam their transmissions.

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,730
The fleet is holding its position, sir.

12
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,893
I think it wise to report our position
before we attack.

13
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,130
Skywalker's fleet is nearby,
in the Bith system.

14
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,018
Good. Perhaps he can reinforce us.

15
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,376
From what I hear,
Skywalker's always ready for a fight.

16
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,018
So I've heard.

17
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,535
- Koh-to-ya, <i>Master Plo.
- Koh-to-ya,</i> little 'Soka.

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,737
<i>How's the hunt
for the mystery weapon going?</i>

19
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,369
We've tracked it to the Abregado system.
We need reinforcements.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,696
<i>I'll have to ask the Council, Master Plo.</i>

21
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,930
<i>I was given strict orders
to protect our staging area.</i>

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,892
<i>Master Plo? What's...</i>

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,698
What is wrong with the transmission?

24
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,294
There is too much interference, sir.
We've lost them.

25
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,219
You heard Master Plo.

26
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,973
He needs our support.
We have to go help him.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,335
We have to see
what the Council decides first.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,297
This is an important meeting, Ahsoka.

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,736
Remember, be mindful.
And speak only when spoken to.

30
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,094
<i>This mystery weapon
has struck in a dozen systems</i>

31
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,136
<i>and disappeared without a trace.</i>

32
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,536
<i>We cannot afford to lose
any more ships, my friends.</i>

33
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,175
<i>Ah, Master Skywalker.
Have you had any success</i>

34
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:11,820
<i>in finding General Grievous'
secret weapon?</i>

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,733
Master Plo was here in the
Abregado system when we lost contact.

36
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,174
The enemy ship is closing!

37
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,454
Prepare for battle!

38
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:29,656
General Grievous, this will be
a suitable test for our new weapon.

39
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,492
You may fire when ready.

40
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,651
Yes, my lord.

41
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,489
We're picking up a large energy reading
from the target, sir.

42
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,855
- Open fire!
- We're not in range yet, sir.

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,655
Fire!

44
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,294
Brace for impact!

45
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,454
We're losing all our power!

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,813
That energy field has left us defenseless!

47
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,209
Their shields are down.

48
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,768
All cannons fire!

49
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,617
They're tearing us apart one by one!

50
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,738
Quickly! lnto the pods!

51
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,450
We don't have much time!
Get inside! Hurry!

52
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,455
Another successful test,
wouldn't you say, Count?

53
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,693
We must keep our position secret.
Send out the hunters.

54
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,216
I want all of those lifepods destroyed.

55
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,409
We've had no further contact
with General Plo Koon.

56
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,049
The absence of distress beacons
indicates that his fleet was...

57
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,495
That his fleet was destroyed
like the others.

58
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,411
We are about to prepare a rescue mission.

59
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,459
<i>Hasn't Clone lntelligence reported
this weapon never leaves any survivors?</i>

60
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,091
<i>The Separatists are being unusually tidy.
They don't want any witnesses.</i>

61
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,253
<i>Tragic are these losses,
but prevent more we must.</i>

62
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,299
The power grid is burned out.

63
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,735
We've no engine, communications, or...

64
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,459
Or life support recharge.

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,451
- So, we'll just sit here and hold our breath.
- Someone'll come looking for us, right?

66
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,728
Let's get the power restored
so we are here to be found.

67
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,370
<i>All our battle groups will be reassigned
to guard our supply convoys,</i>

68
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,893
<i>including yours, Skywalker.</i>

69
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,290
<i>I'm afraid we can't risk any more ships
with a rescue mission.</i>

70
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,736
Wait! Just because
there haven't been any survivors before

71
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,732
doesn't mean there won't be any this time.

72
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,368
<i>Boldly spoken for one so young.</i>

73
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,371
<i>She is learning from Anakin.</i>

74
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,419
Excuse my Padawan. We will deploy
as you have instructed, Master.

75
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,448
Ahsoka!

76
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:14,055
lf anyone could survive, Master Plo could!
I don't understand why...

77
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,734
What you don't understand
is Jedi protocol.

78
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,095
Or your place, my young Padawan.

79
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:22,456
Admiral, we'll split up our ships
to maximize our defense area.

80
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,973
I'll scout ahead for enemy activity.

81
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,813
Isn't that risky
with the mystery weapon out there?

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,097
It might be, but I know
you won't argue my orders.

83
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,132
Come on, Snips.

84
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,215
The air in here is getting
a bit stale.

85
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,612
Don't look at me. It's Boost, sir.
He only takes a bath when he's on leave.

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,658
Save it. Just keep working on the pod,
not your jokes.

87
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,977
Do you think we've got a chance, General?

88
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,529
I don't believe in chance, Commander.

89
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,054
I know if we work together,
we will stay alive,

90
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,210
and someone will find us.

91
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,732
With all due respect, General,

92
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,975
strategically, it doesn't make any sense
for someone to come look for us.

93
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,415
If I was in command,
I'd be hunting that weapon down.

94
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,772
I value your life
more than finding that weapon.

95
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,328
Sir!
There's another pod out there!

96
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,810
If we only had power,
we could contact them.

97
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,529
Well, how about we just wave hello
when the viewport comes around?

98
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,856
They're dead!
Someone busted that pod wide open.

99
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,770
We are not alone out here.

100
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,335
Set those new coordinates, Artoo?

101
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,213
Master, I should tell you
why I spoke up before.

102
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,336
You don't have to explain anything.

103
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,832
Artoo, set up the scanner.
Modulate for incoming mystery weapons.

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,319
No. Artoo, tune the scanners for life forms.
Highest sensitivity.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,799
Why would we scan for life forms

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,394
to spot an enemy weapon
probably just filled with

107
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,916
battle droids?

108
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,196
The Abregado system?

109
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,155
Oh, so it's okay when you don't
follow what the Council says.

110
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,515
Doing what the Jedi Council says,
that's one thing.

111
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,160
How we go about doing it, that's another.

112
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,595
That's what I'm trying to teach you,
my young Padawan.

113
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,910
So you always meant
to come out here for survivors?

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,310
Lives are in danger, Ahsoka.
We can't just turn our backs on them.

115
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,118
That's what I said
back in the briefing room!

116
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,078
I know.
But the way you said it was wrong.

117
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,876
Hurry up. Switch on the illuminator.

118
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,394
We haven't got much time
before the fleet misses us.

119
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,637
No, that's not it.
This one goes there, that one goes there.

120
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,314
Are you sure?
We don't want to make things worse.

121
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,868
How are we gonna make things worse?

122
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,591
When you ask for trouble,

123
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,797
you should not be surprised
when it finds you.

124
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,239
I think trouble already
found us, sir.

125
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,073
What if we connect
these two wires right here?

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,752
I'm getting something.

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,355
<i>This is pod 1977!
We are under attack! Is anyone out there?</i>

128
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,793
It's one of our other pods!

129
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,793
<i>I repeat, we are under attack!
Is anyone out there?</i>

130
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,352
That signal is weak.
They must be close by.

131
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,034
<i>They've locked on to our ship!
They've locked on to our ship!</i>

132
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,348
Go get them, boys!

133
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,274
<i>Our position is mark 12 at .26.</i>

134
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,998
<i>Let's cut this can open.</i>

135
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,354
I have visual contact.

136
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,233
Pod 1977, do you copy?

137
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,232
<i>The droids are hunting
for survivors. They're cutting through!</i>

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,995
<i>There they go!</i>

139
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,153
Things just got a lot worse.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,036
The scanners are practically useless.

141
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,873
Got anything
on the emergency channel, Artoo?

142
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,396
Now, Ahsoka, we might find something
you don't want to find.

143
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,358
I know, Master, but I have to believe.

144
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,989
- How do you know Master Plo, anyway?
- He's one of my oldest friends.

145
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,672
It was Master Plo Koon who found me

146
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,035
and brought me to the temple
where I belonged.

147
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,430
Now he's lost,
so I thought maybe I could find him.

148
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,829
Incoming transmission, Master.

149
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,672
<i>Anakin, where are you?</i>

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,799
Oh, hello, Master. We made a quick stop
in the Abregado system.

151
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,154
<i>You had other orders.</i>

152
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,117
I was my idea, Master Obi-Wan.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,431
<i>Oh, I'm sure.
Well, have you found any survivors?</i>

154
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,399
No. You were right.
The Separatists don't want any witnesses.

155
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,517
<i>All the more reason for you
to rejoin the defensive escorts.</i>

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,953
<i>We need you, Anakin.</i>

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,396
<i>You're going to miss the rendezvous
with the fleet if you don't hurry.</i>

158
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,835
I know, Master. We're on our way.

159
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,589
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

160
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,038
What is it, Artoo?

161
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,830
Artooie thinks he's got something
on the emergency channel.

162
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,433
Can he trace it?

163
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,919
Let's get going.

164
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,757
I think they see us.

165
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,272
<i>Corporal, there's another pod over there.</i>

166
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,913
It is time to go.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,312
- Go? Where are you going, sir?
- Outside, to destroy the enemy.

168
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,029
I can withstand the pressure
for a brief time. Put your helmets on.

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,470
If you say so, sir.

170
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,996
Wolffe, keep
the communications signal alive.

171
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,197
It is our only chance someone will find us.

172
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,555
Let's just hope someone's looking for us.

173
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,158
Are we still picking up that signal?

174
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,712
- Yes. But why aren't we finding anybody?
- I don't know, Ahsoka. I don't know.

175
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,548
Well, this looks like the last one.
Let's finish the job.

176
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,269
<i>Hey!</i>

177
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:55,319
Is anyone out there? This is Ahsoka Tano.
Can anyone hear me?

178
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,510
<i>Time to put the squeeze on them.</i>

179
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,310
<i>ls there anyone out there?
Come in!</i>

180
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,799
<i>This is Ahsoka Tano.</i>

181
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,757
It's Ahsoka! She must be close!

182
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,990
Keep the signal alive, Commander.

183
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,833
Artoo, see if you can boost the reception.

184
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,077
Patience. We're trying to boost the power.
Hang on.

185
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,109
We're losing the signal!
The pod can't take much more damage!

186
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:42,909
<i>- Sinker! Your turn!
- I'm on it, boss!</i>

187
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,901
<i>Whoa!</i>

188
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,509
<i>What the...</i>

189
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,344
<i>Eat laser, clankers!</i>

190
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,141
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

191
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,068
Sir, we have lost contact
with the pod hunter.

192
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:11,381
Perhaps some survivors
are putting up a fight.

193
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,030
That is something we cannot allow.

194
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,067
<i>We must find a way
to destroy this mystery weapon.</i>

195
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,784
<i>In this war, a step ahead of us
Dooku always seems.</i>

196
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:30,980
Tell me, has there been any word
from Master Plo Koon or his fleet?

197
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,947
<i>No. We must fear the worst.</i>

198
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,785
<i>Actually, I just received word that Anakin
has found the remains of Master Plo's fleet</i>

199
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,430
<i>and is searching the debris for survivors.</i>

200
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:46,023
- On whose authority has he done this?
<i>- His own, I'm afraid.</i>

201
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,783
<i>With his fleet out of position,
we are left vulnerable.</i>

202
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,667
<i>Oh, his fleet is right where it should be.</i>

203
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,867
<i>He's taken only a small ship
and his Padawan.</i>

204
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,465
<i>Twice the trouble they have become.</i>

205
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,784
<i>A reckless decision Skywalker has made.</i>

206
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,225
Let us hope it is not a costly one.

207
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,258
<i>Well, General, this is another
fine mess we've gotten into.</i>

208
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,506
<i>Your sense of humor is improving.</i>

209
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,265
<i>I don't mean to say I told you so,</i>

210
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,910
<i>but I never believed anyone
would come looking for us.</i>

211
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,906
<i>Anakin, the Council is furious.
Why have you left your post?</i>

212
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,783
I decided we couldn't just give up
on Master Plo Koon.

213
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,747
<i>A noble gesture, Anakin,</i>

214
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,823
<i>but the Council feels your daring
may put others in danger.</i>

215
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,299
<i>Please listen to me, Anakin.
Return at once.</i>

216
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,348
Yes, Excellency.

217
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,622
Time to go, Ahsoka.

218
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,269
We have to stay.

219
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,818
Ahsoka, I want to believe
Master Plo's alive, but I just...

220
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,424
I know he's alive! I can sense it!

221
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,499
Ahsoka!

222
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,508
<i>Sergeant, why are you so certain
no one is coming?</i>

223
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,300
<i>We're just clones, sir.
We're meant to be expendable.</i>

224
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,063
<i>Not to me.</i>

225
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,306
- There they are!
- Ready tow cable.

226
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,387
Cable loaded, Master.

227
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,389
Come on, hurry!

228
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,226
Are you okay, Master Plo?

229
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,142
There's someone in the pod!

230
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,943
Will they be all right?

231
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,066
The pressure suits offer some protection,

232
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:06,664
but they require a medical frigate
for recovery.

233
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,547
I will stabilize them, sir.

234
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,461
Your men are safe now.

235
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,262
Tell me, were there any survivors?

236
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,818
We couldn't find anybody else.

237
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,346
The hunters must have destroyed the rest.

238
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:22,739
I'm sorry, Master Plo.

239
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:27,543
We tracked the mystery weapon
to this system.

240
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:30,542
That is when we found out
it was an ion cannon.

241
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,983
An ion cannon?

242
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,702
A weapon that neutralizes all power to
our ships, leaving the targets defenseless.

243
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,787
There's a massive vessel approaching.

244
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,338
Shut down the power systems
before they detect us!

245
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,503
The droid!

246
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,589
Sorry, little guy.

247
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,502
That is one big cruiser-crusher!

248
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,025
There's still no signal from the pod hunter.

249
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,184
Reduce speed and activate your scanners.
We will find who is responsible.

250
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,862
Hey, what's with the lights?

251
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,306
The power has gone out.
Maybe that ship has returned.

252
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:36,982
We should get up to the bridge.

253
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,866
You are too weak.
Let me go see what is wrong.

254
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:56,663
We're picking up a faint signal
from a droid.

255
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,389
Not one of ours. They're right behind us.

256
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,866
Move us into attack position!

257
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,549
They're coming back!

258
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,939
Are all the systems shut down?

259
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,907
Is there a problem, sir?

260
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,458
We forgot to shut off the medical droid!

261
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,661
We've got to get the power back on now!

262
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,978
Can I be of assistance?

263
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,630
No, thanks. Just get in the back
and take care of the clones.

264
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,348
That is my programing, sir.

265
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,499
Come on,
we've got to get out of here.

266
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,579
I know! I know!

267
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:33,419
Sir, the enemy is attempting
to flee through the debris field.

268
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,422
General, I don't want any witnesses.

269
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,661
Energize plasma rotors!

270
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,187
Artoo! Program the navicomputer.
Be ready to get us out of here!

271
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:47,101
You forgot. We turned him off.

272
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,506
Target range almost locked, sir.

273
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:57,065
They're not going to make it.

274
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,141
Artoo! Program the hyperdrive!

275
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,989
Anywhere! Hurry!

276
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,982
- Enemy ship targeted, General.
- Fire!

277
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,469
Master?

278
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:43,349
We're clear!

279
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,468
Now the Republic will learn
of our ion cannon.

280
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,388
Your failure is most unfortunate.

281
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,822
I will have to discuss this with my master.

282
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,339
Get back to work!

283
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,227
Roger, roger.
Roger, roger.

284
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,148
Thanks for getting us out of there
in one piece, General Skywalker.

285
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,061
You have my Padawan to thank for that.

286
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,380
She always said
you guys would pull through.

287
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,825
General Plo said
someone would come for us.

288
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,468
We're glad he was right.

289
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:38,259
Skywalker, it is time
to give our report to the Council.

290
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,659
Right, the Council report.

291
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,789
Come on, Ahsoka.

292
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,384
You want me there?
I figured because of before...

293
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,509
Ahsoka, through it all you never gave up.
You did a great job.

294
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,820
But if I'm getting in trouble for this,

295
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,219
you're gonna share
some of the blame, too.

296
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,462
- So, come on. Let's go.
- Right beside you, master.
