1
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,740
<i>A planet of peace!</i>

2
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,620
<i>The artisan colony of the planet Kiros
created a society without weapons.</i>

3
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,380
<i>Instead of war,
they pursued art and beauty.</i>

4
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,790
<i>But in the Clone Wars,</i>

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,090
<i>even peace-loving worlds
are seemingly forced to change sides.</i>

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,310
The simple truth is there is not a warrior
among us, Master Yoda.

7
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,930
An armed conflict will destroy us.

8
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:47,350
We will negotiate with Count Dooku
if we are able.

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,400
<i>Trust Dooku, you cannot. Send help, I will.</i>

10
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,580
I'm afraid it is too late.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,820
The Separatists have already arrived.

12
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,190
Count Dooku, we have chosen
to remain neutral in this war.

13
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,120
Why have you launched
this invasion against us?

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,610
Think of our presence
as a peaceful occupation

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,620
for your protection as well as ours.

16
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,580
I have heard the tragic stories

17
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,120
of worlds caught between your droids
and their clones.

18
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,540
What of my people?

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,760
While I am helpless to prevent the
fighting, I can offer your people sanctuary.

20
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,380
A safe haven until the conflict has ended.

21
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,260
Thank you, Count,
yours is a kind offer, but...

22
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,720
I insist.

23
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,150
Round up the citizens. All of them.

24
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,730
Roger roger.

25
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,490
- Unhand me.
- Watch it.

26
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,370
- Hey! Let me go!
- Hey! Watch it!

27
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,250
I said let me go!

28
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,300
<i>All clear, sir. There are no
Separatist craft in the system.</i>

29
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,180
It's been 10 rotations
since Master Yoda's transmission.

30
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,060
I just hope we're not too late.

31
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
- Rex. Take us down.
- Yes, sir.

32
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:48,410
Anybody else think it's too quiet?
I haven't seen any colonists.

33
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,330
- They're probably hiding.
- Let's hope they stay hidden.

34
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,170
It makes our job easier if we don't have
to worry about them in battle.

35
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,500
I don't like it.

36
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,720
The clankers have never been shy
about using civvies as living shields.

37
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:04,170
I'm sure they're here somewhere.
Let's make for the city center.

38
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,060
Biker droids dead ahead!

39
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,570
Squad, tighten up! Form on me!

40
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,400
We're all clear, Master.

41
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,600
Captain, have your men secure the area.

42
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,940
How are we doing, Boil?

43
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,070
We're still mopping up clankers here
and there, sir.

44
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,610
We've established a perimeter
around the Governor's Tower.

45
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,110
- No one gets out without a fight.
- Good work.

46
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,660
Cody, any word
from the Separatist commander?

47
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,510
He's barricaded inside.
His name is Darts D'Nar.

48
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,960
He sent you a message, sir.

49
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,470
<i>Master Kenobi, come to the tower.
We will negotiate terms for surrender.</i>

50
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,380
Well, that was easy.

51
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:16,860
Zygerrian scum. I'll handle that slaver.

52
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,770
Anakin, he asked for me.

53
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,650
I need you to locate
the missing Togruta colonists.

54
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,490
Fine. I'll have Admiral Yularen initiate
a planetary bio-scan.

55
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:38,700
Why is he so upset?

56
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,540
Anakin has never talked about his past,
has he?

57
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,130
Only to tell me he won't talk about it.

58
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,840
As a child, Anakin and his mother were
sold into slavery by the Hutt clans.

59
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,720
Oh.

60
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,680
And these Zygerrians, they're slavers?

61
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:00,560
Anakin has struggled
to put his past behind him.

62
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,020
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on him.

63
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,660
Yes, make sure you do.

64
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,720
<i>The last shipment
has been received, D'Nar.</i>

65
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,710
<i>I understand the Jedi have attacked.
Why are you still there?</i>

66
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,230
I'm going to make the Jedi pay
for their arrogance.

67
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,590
I have them right where I want them.

68
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,600
Do tell.

69
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,610
<i>Gentlemen, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi,
Jedi Knight.</i>

70
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,450
<i>D'Nar, bring him to me on his knees.</i>

71
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,910
With pleasure.

72
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,450
We were going to discuss surrender?

73
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:06,120
Yes. You will surrender.

74
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,750
We obviously have a misunderstanding,
my friend.

75
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:18,430
<i>- No, you are wrong, Jedi.
- Am I?</i>

76
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,100
<i>You are no doubt aware
your droid forces have been destroyed,</i>

77
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,520
and you are surrounded.

78
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,350
Do the honorable thing
and give up now, D'Nar.

79
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,060
I promise you will receive fair treatment.

80
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,230
You've broken through my defenses.
You think you've won?

81
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,110
Think again.

82
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:37,070
I have planted bombs all over the city.

83
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,000
<i>No one will survive.</i>

84
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,330
<i>Now, surrender.</i>

85
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,960
If you're not bluffing,
then I must concede.

86
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,290
But you'll have to make considerations.

87
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,420
First, you release the colonists.

88
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,510
Here is my counter-offer.

89
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,110
There were no colonists in that structure,
but there could have been.

90
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,610
Now, bow down and surrender to me,
you Jedi filth.

91
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,490
I need a medic over here!

92
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,670
Artoo, where are you?

93
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,910
Watch yourself, buddy.
This is still a war zone.

94
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,670
Cody! We don't have time
for the planetary scan.

95
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,340
- Hook Artoo up, and he'll locate the bombs.
- Right away, sir!

96
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,960
- Ahsoka, let's go.
- Where are we going?

97
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,180
To disarm the bombs
while Obi-Wan negotiates.

98
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,600
I hope he can buy us some time.

99
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,310
Very well, I surrender.

100
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Long before this war,

101
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,690
you Jedi destroyed
the great Zygerrian Slave Empire.

102
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,910
I would kill you now,
but Dooku would prefer you alive.

103
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,530
I understand your frustration.

104
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,370
It is unfortunate you
and I cannot resolve our differences

105
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,750
as you do in the Zygerrian tradition.

106
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,880
With no weapons, you would fight me?

107
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,720
For good reason. Say, if I win,

108
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,720
you reveal the location of the colonists
and the bombs.

109
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,060
And if I win,

110
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:35,480
I deliver you to Dooku in a cage
like one of these filthy creatures.

111
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,690
Perhaps.

112
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,420
Careful, you're disturbing my pets.

113
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,590
They fetch a high price.

114
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,010
General Skywalker!

115
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,150
<i>Your droid is transmitting</i>

116
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,430
<i>the bomb coordinates now.</i>

117
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:10,600
Copy that, Cody.
We're approaching the first bomb now.

118
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,100
Let's go!

119
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,980
Do you hear that?

120
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,210
There must be a wire we should cut
or something to stop the countdown.

121
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,840
Stand back.

122
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,390
Ah!

123
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,060
- How did you know that would work?
- I trusted my instincts.

124
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,810
You mean you guessed.

125
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,450
Yeah, but it was an educated guess.
Now, come on. There's plenty more to go.

126
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:16,540
For thousands of years, Zygerria
supplied slave labor to the galaxy.

127
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,500
We prospered.

128
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,010
Our customers prospered.

129
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,090
Then the Jedi came.

130
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,940
<i>- Excuse me, sir. We have a problem.</i>
- What problem?

131
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,820
<i>Our spotters are tracking
two enemy walkers moving through...</i>

132
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,130
These are the last of them.

133
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,060
Defuse the bombs! I'll cover you!

134
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,690
Master, I think the bombs are linked.

135
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,030
You're supposed to disarm them,
not activate them!

136
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:27,530
Droids on the roof!

137
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,080
If they're connected,

138
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,160
we'll have to defuse them at the same time.

139
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,470
Snipers!

140
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,300
Their shields are too strong!

141
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,900
Come on, Anakin. Hurry up.

142
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm pinned down!
Master, we're running out of time!

143
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,460
I know.
We have to do something and quick!

144
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,760
Ahsoka, they're weak from the side.
I've got an angle on your droid.

145
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:40,310
Okay. I've got a view of yours too.
Same time. Ready?

146
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,310
Go!

147
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,660
- That was a close one.
- Let's hope Obi-Wan shares our luck.

148
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,110
Now I'll take revenge for my people, Jedi.

149
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,530
Sir, you have an urgent transmission.

150
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,660
<i>Sorry to interrupt, sir,
but you weren't responding.</i>

151
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,540
What is it?

152
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,710
<i>Uh... The Jedi have disarmed your bombs.</i>

153
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,250
What?

154
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,420
Give me the detonator!

155
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,060
Certainly took him long enough this time.

156
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,440
Well, shall we discuss your surrender?

157
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,570
Again?

158
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,780
I still have one bomb left, Jedi.

159
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,910
Sir, how could you?

160
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,580
No! No!

161
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,590
Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

162
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,630
Get it off! Get it off!

163
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,100
Anakin! Anakin, come in.

164
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,820
<i>D'Nar is making his escape from the tower.</i>

165
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,310
On our way!

166
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,900
- We'll never catch him in time.
- I am not letting that slaver scum get away.

167
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,890
- So, what's your plan?
- I'm open to ideas.

168
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,620
Hungry, my pet?

169
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
I'll feed you!

170
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,500
Hold on!

171
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,170
"Hold on"? Do I have a choice?

172
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,240
- Master!
- Ahsoka, you're only making it angry!

173
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,070
I'll handle this. Go stabilize the ship.

174
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,730
Young Jedi,
you'll learn your place.

175
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,860
I'm not so young anymore.

176
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
Gotcha.

177
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,270
Mission accomplished, Master.

178
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,480
Where are the colonists?

179
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,610
I will tell you nothing.

180
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,780
Where are they?

181
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,030
Master.

182
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,830
My queen is going
to bring back the royal slave auction

183
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,830
as in the days before the Jedi.

184
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,840
Zygerria will be rich and powerful again.

185
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,510
The Jedi will not stop us this time.

186
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,220
We'll see about that.

187
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:56,100
<i>General Skywalker,
I ran the bio-scan twice,</i>

188
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,600
<i>but the results were negative.</i>

189
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,270
<i>Are you saying
the colonists are not in the city?</i>

190
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,860
<i>I'm saying they're not even on the planet.</i>

191
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,700
<i>The entire population appears
to have simply vanished.</i>

192
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,080
<i>Vanished? That's impossible.
Those are my people.</i>

193
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:16,250
Troubling is the return of the Zygerrians.

194
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,920
It is likely they mean to use Dooku
to rebuild their slaver empire.

195
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:24,460
<i>We cannot allow that, Master.</i>

196
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:29,010
Agree I do, but first
find the colonists you must.

197
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,260
In great danger, they are.

198
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,180
What is it, Master?

199
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,230
Sense I do a darker hand in this mystery.

200
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,230
Slavery, a great tool it is
for the rise of the Sith.
