1
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:20,370
<i>Sinister forces on the move.</i>

2
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,250
<i>Asajj Ventress has suffered
a humiliating betrayal</i>

3
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,750
<i>at the hands of her own assassin,
Savage Opress.</i>

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:28,630
<i>Having gone into hiding,</i>

5
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,380
<i>she now has no choice
but to seek sanctuary</i>

6
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,630
<i>with the Nightsisters of Dathomir.</i>

7
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
Sister, I knew you'd return.

8
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,270
I've been hiding. Reevaluating.

9
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,440
I suspected as much.

10
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,870
Savage, that monster we created,
has forsaken us.

11
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,530
He refused my guidance
and escaped into the galaxy.

12
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:39,860
I have nothing.

13
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,990
You have your breath, your skill,
and your sisters.

14
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:49,670
You have everything needed to survive.

15
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:56,090
You must give up the ways of the Sith
and return to our fold.

16
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:02,470
You will leave Dooku's absurd war behind
and remain with us.

17
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,220
No longer to be ordered about.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,400
You will be loyal to
no one but your sisters,

19
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,900
and yourself.

20
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,080
And then?

21
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,240
And then, you will fulfill your destiny

22
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,620
and become a true Nightsister.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,140
You summoned me, My Lord?

24
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,430
The time has come at last to take revenge

25
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,310
on Asajj Ventress
and the witch, Mother Talzin.

26
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,020
I have learned Ventress
has returned to Dathomir.

27
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,820
Go there and wipe the witches out.

28
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,110
All of them.

29
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,570
Their illusions do not frighten me.

30
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,740
Yes, Master.

31
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,130
Assemble the fleets.

32
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:21,800
The time to exact vengeance against
the traitor, Ventress, has arrived.

33
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,350
We go to Dathomir to battle.

34
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,050
Do you pledge yourself to the sisterhood,

35
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,420
to the magics, and the old ways?

36
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,770
I do.

37
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,350
Do you abandon
your old life for this new one?

38
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,820
I do.

39
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,520
Your loyalty? Your life?

40
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,360
My loyalty. My life.

41
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,400
You are now reborn a Sister of the Night.

42
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,370
Welcome.

43
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,650
Thank you, Mother.

44
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,450
And now, we feast and celebrate

45
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,830
the baptism of our new sister.

46
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:24,050
We are now approaching Dathomir.

47
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:26,720
Begin landing our troops.

48
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,730
I am privileged to be your sister.

49
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,030
Thank you, Karis.

50
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,290
Droid fighters. Scatter!

51
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,800
Prepare yourselves, sisters!

52
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,460
The war has come to Dathomir.

53
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,070
Establish a perimeter and get the droids
in attack formation.

54
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,820
We'll burn a path through the forest
right to their fortress.

55
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,690
Gather your weapons!

56
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,270
The droid army is only here because of me.

57
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,030
And so many are going to die.

58
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,610
There is no time for regret.

59
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,950
Now we must fight.

60
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:19,370
That gutless coward, Grievous,
is coordinating the attack.

61
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,800
I can sense it.

62
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:26,170
You know the droids.
It gives us an advantage.

63
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,060
Karis!

64
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,650
Go and lead us to victory.

65
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,770
We will need an army
to fight Grievous.

66
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,520
I will speak with Old Daka.

67
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,020
She will get us
the reinforcements we need.

68
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:31,610
Follow me, sisters. Attack!

69
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:43,790
Take to the trees, sisters.

70
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,000
We shall attack the droids
from above and below.

71
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,330
Sir, there is heavy fighting
along the eastern front.

72
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,460
Reports indicate Ventress is
leading the attack.

73
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,170
Send in the Defoliator tank.

74
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,800
We'll burn those witches to the ground.

75
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,060
Go to my chamber.

76
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,520
There you will find a
small metallic sphere.

77
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,150
Bring it to the hidden cave.

78
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,030
Yes, Mother.

79
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,890
Daka, as the oldest and wisest of us,

80
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,900
I need you to resurrect our fallen sisters.

81
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:38,400
Ventress will need the aid
of the undead army to achieve victory.

82
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,740
Then I will begin the
chant of resurrection.

83
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,120
Rise.

84
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,120
Rise. Awake, dead sisters.

85
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,750
Rise.

86
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,960
Rise. Rise.

87
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,550
Awake, dead sisters. Rise.

88
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,180
Fire the Defoliator.

89
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,390
Roger, roger.

90
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,710
The army of the dead, her reinforcements.

91
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,200
The undead will clear us a path
right to Grievous.

92
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,960
Ventress has her army now.

93
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,290
Good.

94
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:45,590
Now I can deal with Count Dooku.

95
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,510
We found it, Mother.

96
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,690
Here is the orb you requested.

97
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,270
Well done.

98
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,530
Ah, here it is.

99
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:11,110
A single lock of Count Dooku's silver hair.

100
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,370
He should be more careful
than making deals with witches.

101
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,340
Now for Dooku.

102
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,370
Mother Talzin.

103
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,370
Surprised?

104
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,210
Hardly. You're the one I was sent here for.

105
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,330
Then fight me alone.

106
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,590
Prove you're the greater warrior.

107
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:50,550
If I win, your army leaves.

108
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,720
If you win,
the Nightsisters will surrender to you.

109
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,720
I have always been greater than you.

110
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,270
Pain, Count Dooku.

111
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,950
You will know terrible pain.

112
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:28,340
Enough of this.

113
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,260
You think you can defeat me?
You're nothing.

114
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Kill her.

115
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,680
Doom is upon us, sister. Run.

116
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,100
Save yourself.

117
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,960
Grievous, you must stop Mother Talzin
before she kills me.

118
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,540
Follow the witch's magic.

119
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,590
It appears as a green mist.
Follow it to its source.

120
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,020
And eliminate Talzin. Quickly!

121
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,900
Forget Ventress!
Our new target is Mother Talzin.

122
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,700
Follow me.

123
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,170
Call off your army
and leave Dathomir at once.

124
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,800
And let you and that traitor

125
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,260
continue plotting against me?

126
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,550
Never!

127
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,560
You're going to die either way.

128
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,730
It's only a matter of
how painful it will be.

129
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,900
Fire!

130
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,840
No! General!

131
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,900
It is over, sister.

132
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,820
No one remains?

133
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,450
This is all my fault.

134
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,160
Where do I go? What do I do?

135
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,040
This chapter is over.

136
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:23,710
Your destiny will always
be linked with ours.

137
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,970
But you have your own path to follow now.

138
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,680
No! Wait!

139
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,430
You can't leave me here!
