1
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,039
Ahsoka...

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,292
Tano, is it?

3
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,837
I can't say yours is a name
familiar to me.

4
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,881
Well, I know you.

5
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:54,095
Yes, I imagine
we have several mutual friends.

6
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,056
I wouldn't put it that way.

7
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,308
Of course not.

8
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:02,979
But I'm afraid your way of thinking
is behind the times.

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,400
It's her. Come on! We'll trace the signal.

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:14,491
I was certain that Kenobi
would have come himself.

11
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:17,911
Perhaps bring his loyal foal.

12
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,996
Skywalker, is it?

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,917
Master Kenobi
had a more important engagement.

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:25,919
Indeed.

15
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,463
I wonder...

16
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,842
The moment may be upon us.

17
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,060
Why you?

18
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,772
Why did Kenobi send you?

19
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,859
Why don't you surrender,
and then we can both go and ask him?

20
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:54,572
My surrendering,
well, that would be pointless.

21
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:59,703
For if I am correct,
soon the Jedi and Republic

22
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:03,707
will no longer be the controlling interest
in the galaxy.

23
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,584
And who will be? You?

24
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,336
No.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,089
Darth...

26
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,590
Sidious.

27
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,562
Not yet.

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,069
Come on.

29
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,467
We've lost them.

30
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:07,228
There are a small number of firefights
still happening in sector 11.

31
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,648
But for the most part, your clones
have been as effective as promised.

32
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,444
Still, without Maul in custody,
this could all fall apart quickly.

33
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,197
We must capture him before he escapes.

34
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,201
He mentioned a name, Darth Sidious.

35
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:25,163
Who is this Sidious?

36
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,457
I do not know much,

37
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,377
but I will share with you
what the Council suspects.

38
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:42,389
Darth Sidious is the Sith Lord
who orchestrated the Clone Wars

39
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,016
and played both sides of it
from the beginning.

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,103
I first learned the name from Count Dooku,

41
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:52,357
though any chance of learning more
about Sidious from Dooku has been lost.

42
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,651
Why?

43
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,404
Because Count Dooku is dead.

44
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,906
Anakin killed him
while rescuing the Chancellor.

45
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,658
With Dooku gone,

46
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:05,453
we've lost a vital link to understanding
the mystery of Darth Sidious.

47
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,997
If you can capture Maul,

48
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,084
he may be able to provide
the missing pieces to this puzzle.

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,211
Then send me more men.

50
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,547
Unfortunately, I cannot.

51
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,800
I'm being sent to hunt down
General Grievous on Utapau.

52
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,429
What about Anakin?
Maybe he can reinforce us?

53
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,351
May I speak to Ahsoka alone for a moment?

54
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:43,658
Anakin is on a special assignment
by order of the Jedi Council.

55
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,244
What kind of assignment?

56
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,665
He has been instructed to observe
the Chancellor and report his findings.

57
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,877
Observe? You mean spy.

58
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:58,673
They told him to spy
on the Supreme Chancellor? Why?

59
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,802
The Senate has allowed
the Supreme Chancellor to remain in office

60
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,221
long after his term has expired.

61
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,559
The Council wants to know
what his true intentions are.

62
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:14,981
The Chancellor has been a great friend
and mentor to Anakin.

63
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,859
I can't imagine he is happy about this.

64
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,070
No. He is not.

65
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,281
So perhaps it's best
that you do speak with him.

66
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,407
And what?

67
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,618
Defend the Council's actions?

68
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,329
I hardly think
I'm the best person for that.

69
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,626
Ahsoka, the Council isn't always right.

70
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:37,337
That's why I'm asking for your help.

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,922
Sorry to interrupt,

72
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,085
but there's been an attack.

73
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,509
You had best go.

74
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,806
Tell Anakin...

75
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,016
I will.

76
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:15,125
We got ambushed on our way
to reinforce the entry port on C-deck.

77
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,586
Rex,
make sure C-deck is properly fortified.

78
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,754
Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,633
Commander.

80
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,720
I'm here, Trooper. Sterling, isn't it?

81
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:29,264
Yes. You need to know.

82
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:35,020
Maul, he...
He went right through us, one by one.

83
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,147
He was asking about you.

84
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:41,526
The ARC Trooper, Jesse.

85
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:46,114
Maul realized he was older, somehow,
looked in his mind...

86
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,992
and he took him.

87
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,161
He took Jesse alive!

88
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,170
You're wasting your time.
I won't tell you anything.

89
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:05,842
How charming that you actually believe
that statement to be true.

90
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,974
Clones, bred for combat.

91
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,018
All part of the plan.

92
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,313
What plan? What are you talking about?

93
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:24,069
The plan. The only plan that matters.

94
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,405
Not even I was made aware
of its grand design,

95
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,908
but I played my part.

96
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,118
And do you know what happened to me?

97
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,372
I was cast aside.

98
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,083
I was forgotten.

99
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,378
But I survived,

100
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,340
and I can thrive in the chaos
that is to come.

101
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,095
Saxon,
information is a valuable commodity.

102
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:55,517
See to it that the Prime Minister
does not become an asset to our enemy.

103
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,185
Yes, my lord.

104
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,817
Now, there are some things I need to know,

105
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,985
and you're going to help me.

106
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,905
We can go round and round
in this circle if you want.

107
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,449
I ain't telling you anything.

108
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,661
It is not up to you.

109
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,163
Your mind will speak,

110
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,708
or it will break.

111
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,382
Tell me.

112
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:33,138
Who is this Ahsoka Tano?

113
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,662
I'm flattered that you could find the time
to see me.

114
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,165
What's Maul's plan?

115
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,709
How is he going to escape?

116
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:08,548
Maul is not trying to escape
because he sees no point in doing so.

117
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,426
So, he believes he can defeat us?

118
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,928
No, that's not it.

119
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:18,183
For weeks now he's been consumed
by a strange sense of dread.

120
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,935
Has he mentioned Sidious?

121
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,188
Not that I can recall.

122
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:26,775
You said he wanted Kenobi here. Why?

123
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:29,778
Wasn't just Kenobi he wanted, no.

124
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,530
Uh, there was someone else
he was interested in.

125
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,574
Who?

126
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,328
If only I could remember the name...

127
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,580
Bo, help him remember.

128
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,377
No, wait. It was...

129
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,048
Saxon.

130
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,301
Rex, get a medic!

131
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:55,470
This is Commander Rex.
We have a man down...

132
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,307
Maul had a vision. A dream.

133
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,185
The name came to him.

134
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,603
What name?

135
00:10:05,397 --> 00:10:08,400
Skywalker.

136
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,078
What's going on?

137
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,081
Maul just told the syndicate leaders
to go into hiding.

138
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,715
You once liberated me from my imprisonment

139
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:00,011
by Sidious and his apprentice.

140
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,806
At the time
I thought Dooku was an old fool.

141
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:07,769
But now, now I see he and I are the same.

142
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,313
One step behind.

143
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,567
The dark side has never been stronger.

144
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,279
My lord, what does it mean?

145
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,117
Soon...

146
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,913
the galaxy will be remade,

147
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:32,752
and in the chaos,
we must seize what power we can.

148
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:38,258
It is not the way of your people to hide,
here in the gutters.

149
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:45,265
If you die, I promise you
it will be on the field of battle.

150
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,935
And if you die...

151
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,981
you will die as warriors.

152
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,704
- That's it. Let's go! Watch it, watch it!
- We don't take orders from clones.

153
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,748
You can't hurt us.
You need to leave.

154
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,875
All citizens move to the shelter location.

155
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,143
This occupation cannot last much longer.

156
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,853
The people will not stand for it.

157
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,397
I will not stand for it.

158
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,149
You asked for our help.

159
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,610
My men don't want to be acting
as a police force.

160
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:43,615
The Republic forces will depart
once we capture Maul.

161
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,826
Then you will have your opportunity
to lead.

162
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,162
I agree.

163
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:04,844
My lady, is that any way
to treat your rightful ruler?

164
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:19,526
And now, as a show of good faith,
I return your comrade in arms to you.

165
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:28,660
Run along. There you go.
Back to your brothers.

166
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,497
Are you all right, Jesse?

167
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,417
I'm sorry, Commander. I couldn't help it.

168
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,961
I told him everything.

169
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,254
It's okay.

170
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,089
Rex, get him out of here.

171
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,976
Uh, one of you
might want to deal with that.

172
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,646
You should go. Your people need you.

173
00:14:57,188 --> 00:15:00,942
Don't stay on my account.
We'll be fine.

174
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:03,737
Go.

175
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,291
Watch out!

176
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,461
Fire!

177
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:28,386
Look at them.
So blissfully ignorant.

178
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,514
Care to tell me what this is all about?

179
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,059
Or would you rather save it
for the Council?

180
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,064
Oh, no, no.
You are the one that I wish to speak with.

181
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,902
Were you not cast out of your Order?

182
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,279
I left voluntarily.

183
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:54,204
Yes, but you were motivated to leave
by the hypocrisy of the Jedi Council.

184
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,252
We were both
tools for greater powers.

185
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,715
I am here to bring you to justice.

186
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,637
Justice is merely the construct
of the current power base.

187
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,892
A base, which, according to
my calculations, is about to change.

188
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,103
And Darth Sidious is behind it?

189
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,564
He is behind everything.

190
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,483
In the shadows, always.

191
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,193
But soon, very soon...

192
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,947
he will reveal himself.

193
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:35,412
With your help, the Jedi can stop Sidious
before it's too late.

194
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,998
Too late for what? The Republic to fall?

195
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:41,835
It already has, and you just can't see it!

196
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:48,008
There is no justice, no law, no order,
except for the one that will replace it!

197
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:54,014
The time of the Jedi has passed.
They cannot defeat Sidious.

198
00:16:55,598 --> 00:17:00,812
But, together, you and I can.

199
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:07,652
Every choice you have made...

200
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:11,698
has led you to this moment.

201
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,448
I will help you.

202
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,328
But you must answer one question.

203
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,622
You have but to ask.

204
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:04,542
What do you want with Anakin Skywalker?

205
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:09,798
He is the key to everything.

206
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:12,676
To bring balance to the Force?

207
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:15,303
To destroy.

208
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,890
He has long been groomed for his role,

209
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,936
as my master's new apprentice.

210
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,355
You lie.

211
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,775
I'm afraid not.

212
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,445
In fact, I was so certain of his fate

213
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:38,243
that I orchestrated this war
to lure him here with Kenobi to kill him.

214
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:42,330
Thus,
depriving Sidious of his prized pupil.

215
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,710
I know Anakin.

216
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:54,467
Your vision is flawed.

217
00:18:55,385 --> 00:19:00,056
I see the Padawan needs one last lesson.

218
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,563
You're lucky Anakin didn't show up.

219
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,941
The way you're fighting
you wouldn't have lasted long.

220
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:54,736
Oh, you have Kenobi's arrogance.

221
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,656
You'll find I have many qualities
for you to dislike.

222
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,065
Move it! Move it!

223
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,204
Come on!

224
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,854
Lord Maul! I need backup.

225
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,273
Our forces are falling.
We need your support.

226
00:21:17,736 --> 00:21:19,362
No. I think not.

227
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:23,908
Any moment my ship will be arriving.
Die well, Mandalorian.

228
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,577
No! Wait...

229
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,912
Obi-Wan was right.

230
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,791
You are difficult to kill.

231
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:57,442
We could have destroyed Sidious!

232
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,694
Only for you to take his place!

233
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,837
Lord Maul,
we must depart immediately.

234
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,928
Come on. Get the gunships.

235
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,101
I give you one last chance.

236
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:16,646
Join me... or die.

237
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,481
Never.

238
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,534
Let me go!

239
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,202
Let me die!

240
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:39,252
You're all going to burn!

241
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:40,962
We're all going to die!

242
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:43,173
You don't know what you're doing!

243
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:52,057
We'll take it from here, Commander!
