1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,200
Galactic showdown!

2
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,790
In a fierce battle for survival,
the Republic and Separatist armies

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,130
have clashed in the distant Sullust system.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:30,630
Count Dooku's most cunning assassin,
Asajj Ventress, leads the vicious attack.

5
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,260
Trident group one,
attack the starboard engines.

6
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:48,350
Trident group two,
knock out their port shield generators.

7
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,810
I'll go directly for their bridge.

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,780
The port side deflectors are gone!

9
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,600
Lord Tyrannus.

10
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,180
My master.

11
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,180
There is a disturbance in the Force.

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,190
Your assassin,
she has become very powerful.

13
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,360
Yes, my Lord.
She is quite important to me.

14
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,320
Too important.

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,200
- Master...
- Silence!

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,530
I can sense her powers growing stronger.

17
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,710
I would hate to think you are training
your own Sith apprentice to destroy me.

18
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,500
Never!
My allegiance is to you, and you alone!

19
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,760
Then you must prove it.

20
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,420
Eliminate her.

21
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,380
She's my most trusted...

22
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,680
I said eliminate her!

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,770
As you wish, my Lord.

24
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,230
- Ventress!
- Split up!

25
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,080
Looks like I'm her favorite!

26
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,290
I'm kind of disappointed.
Only the droids follow me.

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,260
You wanna race? Come on!

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
Anakin, I'm going to need some help.

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,610
Where are you?

30
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,460
I'm hit! I'm heading
towards the Separatist flagship.

31
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,830
I see you! I've got her.

32
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,230
Master, I need your help, quickly.

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,190
I'm surrounded.

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,270
You have already lost the battle, child.

35
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,690
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.

36
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,660
No! I will destroy the Jedi.

37
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,030
I'll show you!

38
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,780
You have failed me for the last time.

39
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,580
You are no longer my apprentice.

40
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,170
And now, you shall die.

41
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,130
Obi-Wan. Obi-Wan!

42
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,640
Oh! Thank you!

43
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,430
Thank you, Artoo, that's quite enough.

44
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,190
Ventress. You're not looking well.

45
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,860
She never does.

46
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,740
You have failed, Ventress. Surrender!

47
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
Never!

48
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,480
Yes, my Lord.

49
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,730
Ventress is battling the Jedi
on board the command ship.

50
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,070
Turn your guns on our command ship
and open fire!

51
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,610
But, my Lord, I calculate that will destroy
Ventress, the Jedi, and all our forces.

52
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,780
Precisely.

53
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,470
We're in position.

54
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,680
Open fire.

55
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,430
That is correct. Calculate your flight path
to terminate in the main hangar.

56
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,350
It's over!

57
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,110
Anakin! Look out!

58
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,650
We have to get out of here!

59
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,590
The command ship has been destroyed.

60
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,140
Our scanning indicates
there are no survivors.

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,480
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.

62
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,310
By your command.

63
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,050
Master.

64
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,710
What is it, Lord Tyrannus?

65
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,330
I have done as you've asked.

66
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,300
Asajj Ventress is dead.

67
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,880
Once again,
you've proven your loyalty to me.

68
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,100
You took quite a beating there,
didn't you, missy?

69
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,450
Which side of the battle was you on?

70
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,690
Aw.

71
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,570
Not too talkative, are you?

72
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,780
Take me to Dathomir.

73
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,120
Now why would anyone want to go there?

74
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,790
Ain't nothing there but fog and witches.

75
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,620
Exactly.

76
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,350
We don't like strangers.

77
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,810
I'm not a stranger.

78
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,690
Prepare to die.

79
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,020
Stop!

80
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:58,030
She is one of us.

81
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,030
Take her to the village.

82
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,410
- Who is she? What is she doing here?
- Quiet. Quiet!

83
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,330
Mother Talzin.

84
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,770
Bring the water of life.

85
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,250
At last, you have returned,

86
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,770
and you are safe again.

87
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,280
I remember the day
we were forced to give you up

88
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,730
to protect the clan.

89
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,610
Your sacrifice has never been forgotten.

90
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,950
Master.

91
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,080
Master! Where are you?

92
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,670
Master!

93
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,840
They killed you.

94
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,150
You are strong with the Force, little one.

95
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,250
Thank you, Master.

96
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,850
Thank you, Master.

97
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,680
Master!

98
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,870
Revenge! I must have revenge!

99
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,410
I can sense the darkness within you.

100
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,370
I will teach you the ways of the darkside,

101
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,300
but you must prove yourself first.

102
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,300
Master, I need your help, quickly.

103
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,470
I've ordered your reinforcements to return.

104
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,480
No! I will destroy the Jedi.

105
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,810
I'll show you!

106
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,730
You have failed me for the last time.

107
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,900
And now, you shall die.

108
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,660
Dooku. He betrayed me.

109
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,490
I know. I had hoped
you would find your way to us sooner.

110
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,790
I will have revenge.

111
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes, you shall, Sister.

112
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,750
We will see to it.

113
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,260
Karis and Naa'leth
are the greatest warriors of our coven.

114
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,230
I'll be the judge of that.

115
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,600
They will help you destroy Count Dooku.

116
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,340
Sister, we have assembled a potion
for you to use

117
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,640
in order to reach
Dooku's palace undetected.

118
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,140
Step into the mist

119
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,060
and become like shadows.

120
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,750
Now you are invisible to most.

121
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,370
Even Count Dooku?

122
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:06,210
Yes, perhaps even Count Dooku.

123
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,590
What if he can sense us?

124
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,010
Take this poison dart.

125
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,390
It will dull his senses
and distort his vision.

126
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Then you can deal with him easily.

127
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,200
Jedi weapons?

128
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,190
You'll need these.

129
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:33,910
If the Count engages you,
he must believe that you are Jedi.

130
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,080
Naa'leth and Karis, serve your sister well.

131
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,540
Deliver your vengeance, Sister,

132
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,380
then return to us.

133
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,300
We shall prevail.

134
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,120
This way.

135
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,120
- He's below us.
- You can sense him?

136
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,950
I can smell his stench a parsec away.

137
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,960
Be on guard at all times. He is no fool.

138
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,300
He is a Sith Lord.

139
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,490
What sorcery is this?

140
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,220
I do not need my eyes to see you, Jedi.

141
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,080
Aah!

142
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,030
He is stronger than I imagined.

143
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,410
I warned you.

144
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,060
Mother, we've...

145
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,100
We've failed.

146
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,650
Where one sees failure,

147
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,750
others see opportunity.

148
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,950
What do you mean, Mother?

149
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,330
Your infiltration
proves Dooku is vulnerable.

150
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,580
He will be eager to protect himself.

151
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,630
How?

152
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,760
By finding a replacement for you.

153
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:55,310
Count Dooku. It has been too long.

154
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,520
Yes, Mother Talzin.
How may I assist you?

155
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,990
It has come to my attention that
you have lost your most prized assassin.

156
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,530
How would you know of this?

157
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
I know these things.

158
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,950
I have seen it.

159
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,370
After all, she was once one of us.

160
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,540
It is true that your warriors
are of an extraordinary caliber.

161
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,670
Perhaps something different this time.

162
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,340
Perhaps a male from our planet
will be more to your liking,

163
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,390
since you could not tame the female.

164
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,480
I shall take you up on your offer.

165
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:41,730
Excellent. I will be in contact.

166
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,900
I will see Count Dooku dead.

167
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,030
I swear it.

168
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,830
So you shall.

169
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,620
So you shall.
