1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,620
A world in crisis!

2
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,540
The peaceful planet of Mandalore is
being strangled by the grip of corruption.

3
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:26,370
With shortages of every kind,

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,040
citizens must turn to the black market
in order to survive.

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,840
Desperate to free her people,

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,670
Duchess Satine
has asked her friend Padmé Amidala

7
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,720
to speak with the Jedi Council

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,180
in hopes that they will send assistance
to her struggling world.

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,680
The Jedi Council has
given you a mission, Ahsoka.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,390
It's your duty to see it through.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,020
Don't you think
I'm just a little overqualified for this?

12
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,490
According to Senator Amidala,
Mandalore is a deeply corrupt world.

13
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,030
If the cycle is to be broken,

14
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,200
the future leaders at
the Royal Academy of Government

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,700
must learn the evils of corruption.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,340
Yoda feels that only a young Padawan
like you can get through to them.

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,470
My lady, if I may,
what do the Jedi know of our ways?

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,390
Do we really want them meddling
with our children's education?

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,980
Surely there is nothing to fear

20
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,190
from exposing them to new ideas,
Prime Minister.

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,070
Duchess Satine.

22
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,030
Prime Minister Almec.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,070
Master Skywalker,
so good to see you again.

24
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,780
This is your Padawan, I assume?

25
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,830
Yes, my lady. May I present Ahsoka Tano.

26
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,080
Duchess. Prime Minister.

27
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,580
I am grateful that the Jedi Council
could spare the two of you

28
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,130
to help instruct our leaders
and peacekeepers of tomorrow.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,130
Please thank Master Yoda for me.

30
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,010
I'm afraid that
due to our limited resources,

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,260
I must return to battle immediately.

32
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,020
So you will not be staying,
Master Skywalker?

33
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,100
No, but I assure you,
Padawan Tano is a highly capable Jedi

34
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,060
and has the full confidence of the Council.

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,860
Very well. Cadet Korkie, Amis, Lagos.

36
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:21,960
These are some of the cadets that
you will be instructing, Padawan Tano.

37
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,780
Nice to meet all of you.

38
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,080
- That's a fine weapon. May I see it?
- I'm afraid not.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,120
Because of Master Kenobi's recent visit
and the trouble that followed,

40
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,170
no offworlders may carry weapons
on Mandalore.

41
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,880
Master Obi-Wan caused trouble?
That's a first.

42
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,680
Just give me the lightsaber.

43
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,970
Thank you for respecting our ways,
Master Jedi.

44
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,350
Excuse the interruption, sir,
but it is time to depart.

45
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
General Fisto is expecting us.

46
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,620
If you'll excuse me.

47
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,540
Corruption is what happens

48
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:12,290
when someone in power
puts their own personal gain

49
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,790
before the interests of
the people they represent.

50
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,210
- So, it's a result of greed?
- Yes.

51
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,380
A leader sacrifices moral integrity
for the sake of money or power.

52
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,100
Entire star systems have collapsed
into chaos or revolution

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,140
because their greedy politicians
got caught up

54
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,990
in a cycle of bribery and blackmail,
while their people suffered.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,160
Does that mean
most government officials are corrupt?

56
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,480
Well, no.

57
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:41,490
But the point is
that temptation is always there,

58
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,570
and citizens must be vigilant
so corruption can't take root.

59
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,240
The deadliest enemies of a society
dwell within its borders.

60
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,960
And from these internal threats,
the people need to be protected.

61
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,250
But if you don't trust your leaders,
isn't that treason?

62
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,010
It's every citizen's duty
to challenge their leaders,

63
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,510
to keep them honest and
hold them accountable if they're not.

64
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,970
How do you do that?

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,180
By exposing corrupt officials
for what they are.

66
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,180
Lasting change can only come from within.

67
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,940
Be sure your assignments
are prepared for tomorrow.

68
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,360
The school's out of rations again.

69
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,610
I guess there'll be
no late-night snacks tonight.

70
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,160
Listen, we've had a food shortage
since the war began.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,040
Transport ships keep coming in,
but there's strict rationing.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,870
Something is wrong on Mandalore.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,830
But these problems are bigger than us.
Just let the authorities handle it.

74
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,000
We have to do something about it,
like Ahsoka said.

75
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,880
Let's go down to the warehouse district
and see if there really is a food shortage.

76
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,800
Beats sitting around here,
listening to my stomach growl.

77
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,160
These doors are heavily secured
by the government.

78
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,980
It won't be secure for long.

79
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,910
Looks like the Academy taught us well.

80
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:14,870
Come on, up and over.

81
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,890
I have a bad feeling about this.

82
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,930
- What are you doing?
- Quiet!

83
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,440
It sounds like someone else is in here.

84
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,650
- Let's get out of here.
- No! Come on!

85
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,950
The risk involved makes the price go up.

86
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,580
You must be more cautious.
Coming here could raise suspicion.

87
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,120
It's a little late for a meeting, isn't it?
Let's get a closer look.

88
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,340
Are you crazy?

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,600
It wasn't my idea.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,180
Soniee, quick, use your holocam.

91
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,530
Those look like Mandalorian police,
but they're unmarked.

92
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,940
Who's that?

93
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,030
And who are those guys?

94
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,360
What are offworlders doing
on a secure port?

95
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,530
I don't like this. I'm getting out of here.

96
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,760
Hurry! This way!

97
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,700
Hey! No!

98
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,980
What are we going to do?

99
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,440
This is bigger than we thought.
We're going to need help.

100
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,780
We should speak to my Aunt Satine.

101
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,710
Aunt Satine, may we speak with you?

102
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:11,210
Of course, Korkie. Come in.

103
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,890
We did some investigating.

104
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,180
There's no food shortage. We found
stores of food at the government port.

105
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,190
- How would you know this?
- That doesn't matter right now.

106
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,520
I beg to differ.

107
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,410
We made a recording of a secret meeting
between what we know

108
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,860
was a government official
and a black marketeer.

109
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,860
That's why everything costs so much
and so many people are starving.

110
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,370
We need your help
to find the one responsible.

111
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,330
This is a serious matter, I agree.

112
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,580
But the source of this evil may be
more than you cadets can handle.

113
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,420
People can be very deceiving.

114
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,250
You don't want to
get yourselves into trouble.

115
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,170
But, Auntie, don't you see?
You can't ignore this!

116
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,560
I won't, trust me.

117
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,550
But for your own safety,
you must let me take care of it.

118
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,560
Now run along, all of you.
Concentrate on your studies.

119
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,890
There will be a time to save the world
when you're a bit older.

120
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,740
She refused to help us because
she doesn't think we can handle it.

121
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,410
She just thinks
we're a bunch of stupid kids.

122
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:20,910
She acted like nothing was wrong.

123
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,410
We need to find someone else
who believes us.

124
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,340
Like who?

125
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:27,330
Mandalore has two people in charge.

126
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,830
Since my aunt won't help,
we'll have to go to the Prime Minister.

127
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,500
What makes you think he'll listen?

128
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,340
I've known him my whole life.

129
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,170
He's always told me to come to him
if I'm ever in trouble.

130
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,050
And I'd say we're all in big trouble.

131
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,560
I am most concerned by these allegations,
my intrepid young cadets.

132
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,890
You think Duchess Satine knows
who the conspirator is?

133
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,730
She said she was going to handle it.

134
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,370
Meet me in the Palace Plaza tonight.

135
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,860
Bring the recording you took
of the black market deal

136
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,860
and all the cadets who know about it.

137
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,500
Korkie, you seem distracted today.
What's going on?

138
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,420
We did what you said.
We found evidence of corruption.

139
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,710
What do you mean?

140
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,630
Well, we were hungry,
so we decided to go look for food.

141
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,050
- Food?
- Yeah.

142
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,880
Down at the government warehouse.

143
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,550
Someone just let you in
to inspect the warehouse?

144
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,970
- No, we broke in.
- Oh, great.

145
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,890
So you committed a crime?

146
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,060
It sounds bad, I know, but then
we saw a meeting and offworlders and...

147
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,280
And they chased us!

148
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,900
Maybe they chased you

149
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,900
because you broke into
a government warehouse.

150
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,240
No! It was a black market deal. I know it!

151
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,820
My Aunt Satine told us to stay out of it,
but we must do something.

152
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:47,620
- Do you have proof?
- We made a holo-recording.

153
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:50,580
The Prime Minister
is meeting us tonight to...

154
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,330
Are you sure that's a good idea?

155
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,750
But I thought you said it was the duty of
every citizen to expose corrupt officials.

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,130
I'm only saying
that you should take this slowly.

157
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Examine all of the facts and all of
the people involved before you act.

158
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,270
You sound more like my aunt
than a Jedi Knight.

159
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,700
You Korkie?

160
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,290
Prime Minister, is that you?

161
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,340
Secret Service. You are all under arrest
for treason, corruption, and conspiracy.

162
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,590
You will come with us.

163
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,720
These are the same guards
we saw last night.

164
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,260
We've done nothing wrong.

165
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,570
Looks like the Prime Minister set you up.

166
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,490
That's treason.
He's the leader of our system.

167
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,240
He couldn't possibly be a traitor.

168
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,750
We need proof.

169
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,540
We have the recording.

170
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,550
That's no good. You can't see who it is.

171
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,010
Wait! Stop right there.

172
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:29,550
Information retrieval,
I need you to ID a hologram.

173
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,020
That's him!

174
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,620
You're right! That is the Prime Minister.

175
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,110
We have to take this to my aunt
and warn her.

176
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,120
They know I talked to her.

177
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
We're too late.

178
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,580
He's dead.

179
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,600
Korkie, wait!
The intruders may still be inside.

180
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,970
They took her. This is all my fault!

181
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,900
Who knows what they've done to her.

182
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,610
Now what?
How are we supposed to find her?

183
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,320
Who can we trust?

184
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,200
I need all of you to calm down and focus.

185
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,660
We know the Prime Minister is behind this.

186
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,660
After my aunt, he's the most
powerful person on Mandalore.

187
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,050
So, let's go talk to him.

188
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,550
Master Jedi,
this is an unexpected pleasure.

189
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,800
What can I do for you?

190
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,930
Actually, Prime Minister,
it's what I can do for you.

191
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:05,400
I believe some of my students
are involved in a conspiracy against you.

192
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,400
Intriguing.

193
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,960
You can't do this!
We trusted you, Master Tano.

194
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,130
Thank you for bringing the traitors
to justice, Master Jedi.

195
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:29,090
They mentioned that
Duchess Satine was their leader.

196
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,550
We should arrest her, too.

197
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,150
Do not worry,
we already have her in custody.

198
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,220
Really? Where?

199
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,100
That is none of your concern.

200
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:42,810
Now I must prepare a public statement
about the Duchess and her crimes.

201
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,620
Officer, I need to interrogate
the prisoners immediately.

202
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,400
Careful. We're being watched.

203
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,690
Did he buy it?

204
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:35,160
- Have you found my aunt?
- Not exactly.

205
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,740
But I know they have her in custody.

206
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,830
- Where?
- The Prime Minister wouldn't tell me.

207
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:42,910
I knew this plan wouldn't work.

208
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,170
Have a little faith. I'll find her.
We'll just modify the plan a bit.

209
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,050
How are you going to do that?

210
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:53,510
Don't worry. You'll know when to act
when I give the signal.

211
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,180
- What's the signal?
- You'll know it when you see it.

212
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,270
- You will take me to Duchess Satine.
- I will take you to Duchess Satine.

213
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,760
What are you doing?

214
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,940
- I must interrogate the Duchess.
- You must interrogate the Duchess.

215
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,450
I'm getting you out of here.

216
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,370
Ahsoka, it's a trap.

217
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:06,010
I see you found the Duchess, youngling.

218
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,540
You may stop
your playacting now, Sergeant.

219
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,460
- Prime Minister, sir!
- Prime Minister, sir!

220
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,380
Using a Jedi mind trick
was a very poor decision.

221
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,340
My guards have been trained
to resist such archaic magic.

222
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,560
And now you have revealed yourself
as a conspirator.

223
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,360
Set for stun.

224
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:30,560
You little fool.

225
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,650
Where is she?

226
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,740
Stick to Ahsoka's plan.

227
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,320
But how do we do that? It's falling apart.

228
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,820
Ahsoka wants us to wait for a signal,
and that's what we're going to do.

229
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,660
Sign it. Sign the confession
and admit to your treasonous ways.

230
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,750
There is only one traitor
to Mandalore here, Prime Minister,

231
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,050
and that's you!
You control the black market.

232
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,020
You have betrayed the public trust,

233
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:01,930
and used your office
to accumulate wealth and power.

234
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,550
It's shameful.

235
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,810
Your idealism is inspiring,
my dear, but hopelessly naive.

236
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,520
I established the black market
for the people.

237
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,190
That's absurd!

238
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,030
The war is disrupting trade
across the galaxy.

239
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,690
The profits from the black market

240
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,780
are being used to purchase
humanitarian supplies for Mandalore.

241
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,040
Think of it as a new tax
in the interest of national security.

242
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,710
It's a tax for your benefit,
Prime Minister.

243
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,790
Where are these "humanitarian supplies"
you speak of?

244
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,710
Sergeant, put the shock collar on her.

245
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,760
My patience has worn thin, Duchess.
Maybe this will convince you.

246
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,480
I would rather die
than sign your confession.

247
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
That can be arranged.

248
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,940
You're wasting your time!

249
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:00,740
Bring me those traitorous cadets.

250
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:04,660
No, you can't! They're just children!

251
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,430
All right, let's move.

252
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,430
I'm afraid your nephew
will have to suffer needlessly.

253
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:25,300
Put the shock collar on Cadet Korkie.

254
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,450
Go!

255
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,220
Gotcha!

256
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,490
Stop fighting!

257
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,990
Send for my personal guards.

258
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,340
You must know by now
that I didn't bring you here just to teach.

259
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,840
I knew something was amiss,
but I had no one to trust.

260
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:48,840
I thought if I brought a Jedi,

261
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:53,560
especially a friend of Senator Amidala's,
we could solve this mystery together.

262
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
I never doubted you, Duchess.

263
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,360
Neither did we.

264
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,490
It was an honor
to serve with a Jedi Knight.

265
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,620
It was my privilege to be your teacher.

266
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,750
I hope this assignment
wasn't too boring for you.

267
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,850
It had its moments.

268
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,640
Like the one
where you convinced untrained children

269
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,470
to help you overthrow
a corrupt government?

270
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,640
That was a highlight.

271
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,270
It sounds pretty risky.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.

272
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,730
Nothing you wouldn't have done.
