1
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:18,239
A calculated risk!

2
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,081
Following a costly victory
on the planet Malastare,

3
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:25,240
Chancellor Palpatine orders Jedi Knights
Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker

4
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:28,441
to transport a fearsome Zillo Beast
captured during the battle

5
00:00:28,522 --> 00:00:30,200
back to Coruscant.

6
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,600
After seeing that not even a lightsaber
could harm the Beast,

7
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:37,241
Chancellor Palpatine hopes to unlock
the secret of its invulnerability

8
00:00:37,282 --> 00:00:40,520
to create new armor
for the Republic's clone troopers.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,562
Tensions run high as the most
dangerous life form in the galaxy

10
00:00:44,602 --> 00:00:47,999
touches down
on the Republic's most populous planet.

11
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:55,200
Let's go! Move it! Move it!

12
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,680
Come on. Come on! I can see him.

13
00:00:57,721 --> 00:00:59,481
Stand your ground.

14
00:01:08,921 --> 00:01:10,681
Watch it! Watch it!

15
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,320
- You are clear. You are clear.
- Copy that.

16
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:27,521
No, no, don't stop.
- Yes, sir.

17
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,680
Your Excellency.

18
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:44,640
Such size, such power.

19
00:01:45,402 --> 00:01:47,481
With respect, Chancellor,

20
00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:50,361
I believe this creature could pose
any number of dangers.

21
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,241
Bringing it here to Coruscant is a mistake.

22
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:57,281
I assure you I did not make this decision
lightly, Master Jedi.

23
00:01:57,882 --> 00:02:00,801
The sooner we unlock
the Zillo Beast's secrets,

24
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:03,441
the sooner we can end this terrible war.

25
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:05,360
I hope you're right, Chancellor.

26
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm turning the Zillo Beast
over to you, Doctor.

27
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,881
I trust it will be given good care.

28
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,881
The Beast is a priceless resource,
Master Windu.

29
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,601
It will be well treated, I assure you.

30
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:56,441
Why would the Chancellor
want to bring the Beast here?

31
00:02:56,562 --> 00:02:59,401
I know that he thinks by studying it,
the knowledge could prove beneficial,

32
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:01,721
but from what you and Anakin
reported on Malastare,

33
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:03,721
it hardly seems worth the effort.

34
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:07,161
I raised the issue with the Chancellor
during the Battle of Malastare,

35
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:08,761
without success.

36
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:14,401
Well then, in that case,
perhaps it's time we let someone else try.

37
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,161
That's enough.

38
00:03:55,002 --> 00:04:00,121
Its scales are remarkably strong and light.
If we could examine their composition,

39
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:04,602
we might be able to synthesize them
to reinforce our clone armor.

40
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:08,841
- And what is stopping you?
- We need to remove the scales first.

41
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:12,360
It's very difficult, not to mention painful.

44
00:04:19,642 --> 00:04:21,722
Chancellor, I must protest.

45
00:04:22,162 --> 00:04:26,402
Besides being the last of its kind,
this creature may be intelligent.

46
00:04:26,843 --> 00:04:30,201
I find that hard to believe.
It is, after all, just an animal.

47
00:04:31,683 --> 00:04:33,601
It didn't seem to like your comment.

48
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:38,082
I applaud your high moral stance, Doctor.

49
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:41,442
After all,
principle is in short supply these days.

50
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:45,561
However, every passing minute of warfare
brings countless deaths,

51
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:49,641
deaths that could be prevented
once the Beast's secrets are unlocked.

52
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:54,241
If there is any way to hasten that process,
it is our moral duty to explore it.

53
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:59,842
I serve at your pleasure, Chancellor.
I'm just not sure where to begin.

54
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:03,121
The fact remains
that the Beast is indestructible.

55
00:05:03,643 --> 00:05:06,402
Nothing is truly indestructible, Doctor.

56
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:10,602
Wasn't there something in Malastare fuel
that affected the Beast?

57
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:14,001
- It weakened the Zillo, yes, but...
- Excellent.

58
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:16,202
I suggest you start there.

59
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:19,961
Doctor, you need to find a way
to kill that Beast,

60
00:05:20,764 --> 00:05:23,721
or we shall replace you
with someone who can.

61
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:56,602
Oh, hello!
You're not in trouble again, are you?

62
00:05:57,764 --> 00:05:59,402
I am not being rude.

63
00:05:59,963 --> 00:06:02,081
Not that it isn't a pleasure, Senator,

64
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:05,002
but I thought I was just meeting
Obi-Wan here.

65
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:08,042
Master Kenobi explained the problem.
I'm here to help.

66
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:11,001
Problem? What problem?

67
00:06:11,723 --> 00:06:15,242
The situation with our friend
from Malastare.

68
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:18,161
Uh-huh. I see what's going on here.

69
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,162
You think I can help influence
the Chancellor.

70
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:23,361
The Zillo Beast was chained up
and brought here against its will.

71
00:06:23,643 --> 00:06:25,962
It has no voice to defend itself.

72
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,523
Anakin, we have to be that voice.

73
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:33,482
You haven't seen it in action.
You have no idea what it's capable of.

74
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,282
It's what we're capable of
that frightens me.

75
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:40,162
A creature's life,
maybe even an entire species, is at stake.

76
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,881
Doesn't that at least warrant a discussion?

77
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:47,322
I didn't think you'd feel
so strongly about it.

78
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:49,922
All right, let's speak to the Chancellor.

79
00:06:50,004 --> 00:06:52,282
But I still don't like this.

80
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:57,601
I should have known secrets
do not stay secret for long around here.

81
00:06:57,843 --> 00:07:00,682
Isn't that precisely the point
of a democracy?

82
00:07:00,763 --> 00:07:03,802
Of course, in wartime,
some things must be kept secret.

83
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:06,282
Even from the people,
so as not to aid the enemy.

84
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:09,682
It is unfortunate
that the Beast must die, Senator.

85
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,522
But the greater good demands it.

86
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:15,482
How is killing the last of a species,
in secret and without debate,

87
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,082
good for anyone?

88
00:07:17,123 --> 00:07:21,723
Don't you have more pressing issues
that require your attention today?

89
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:24,522
No, Mr. Speaker, I do not.

90
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:29,243
I sympathize, my dear, truly I do.
But consider this.

91
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:33,082
A democracy is only as strong
as the people who comprise it.

92
00:07:33,283 --> 00:07:35,802
At present,
the people I am charged with protecting

93
00:07:35,843 --> 00:07:38,282
are dying faster than I can count.

94
00:07:39,244 --> 00:07:42,522
It is my moral imperative to take action.

95
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:47,001
Anakin, is it not worth
the life of one savage beast

96
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,922
to give our brave troops
the advantage they need to win this war?

97
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:57,442
My role is not to set policy, Chancellor,
but I do see both points of view.

98
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:00,282
I'm certain a reasonable solution
will present itself.

99
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:03,002
Master Kenobi has taught you well.

100
00:08:03,323 --> 00:08:04,643
Chancellor.

101
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:07,322
Excuse me.

102
00:08:09,683 --> 00:08:13,603
You are supposed to be helping!
Whose side are you on, anyway?

103
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:17,882
Yours, but you must admit the Chancellor
makes some good points.

104
00:08:26,044 --> 00:08:29,883
Ah, Doctor Boll,
I trust you have some progress to report.

105
00:08:30,363 --> 00:08:36,322
Yes, Chancellor. I was able to convert
the Malastare fuel toxin into a poison gas.

106
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,922
I believe it's now strong enough
to kill the Zillo Beast,

107
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:43,003
if that's still how you wish to proceed.

108
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,403
I wish I saw an alternative.

109
00:08:45,444 --> 00:08:49,442
However, sadly I must ask you
to proceed with your assignment.

110
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:08,362
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, it will all be over soon.

111
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:10,682
Begin procedure.

112
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,203
Vital signs are dropping.

113
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,642
No. It should have been enough.

114
00:09:53,204 --> 00:09:55,002
I don't like the sound of that.

115
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:58,763
If that creature is as powerful as they say,
what good are these rifles gonna be?

116
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,362
Ah, shut up, Kosmos.

117
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,444
I'm on it, Leader.

118
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,402
Take it down! Take it down!
Man down!

119
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,003
You in the black, let's go!

120
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:24,363
Head up!

121
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:27,082
Go, go, go, go, go, go!
Hold. Everyone, back!

122
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,924
Oh, no.

123
00:10:35,204 --> 00:10:37,282
Doctor, were you successful?

124
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:38,763
We have a problem, sir.

125
00:10:49,843 --> 00:10:53,522
We need time to convert Malastare fuel
into more toxin, Chancellor.

126
00:10:53,684 --> 00:10:55,243
I suggest you hurry, Doctor.

127
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:58,322
Evacuate the staff
to the underground shelters.

128
00:10:58,645 --> 00:11:00,843
Stay with General Kenobi. I'm on my way.

129
00:11:00,923 --> 00:11:03,203
Better hurry, sir.
You're missing all the fun.

130
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,683
I have no doubt the Jedi...

131
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,403
...to ensure the safety...

132
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:28,483
...that I will not stand...

133
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,084
It's coming this way!

134
00:12:36,564 --> 00:12:39,644
Perhaps now would be a good time
to evacuate to the lower levels.

135
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:47,963
Yes. We are going now.

136
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,842
Desperately needed the tanks are.

137
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,123
We're almost at the loading dock,
Master Yoda.

138
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,563
Dire the situation has become.

139
00:13:07,643 --> 00:13:10,724
Before more lives are lost,
act quickly we must.

140
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:22,124
My security staff insisted on adding
this emergency escape route.

141
00:13:28,884 --> 00:13:32,123
Chancellor, I think we may have
enough toxin now.

142
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,964
My guards will be with you shortly.

143
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:39,244
Hand the gas over to them immediately.

144
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:41,163
Does it have to be destroyed?

145
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:44,364
- The Jedi stun cannons...
- Will not eliminate the problem.

146
00:13:44,444 --> 00:13:47,323
Our advanced technology
simply cannot contain it.

147
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:49,603
I wish we had
never brought the Beast here.

148
00:13:53,164 --> 00:13:57,403
Pardon me, Mistress Padmé,
but I believe something is following us.

149
00:13:58,766 --> 00:13:59,763
Evasive action!

150
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:12,123
We're doomed!

151
00:14:18,366 --> 00:14:22,164
All tanks acquire solution
and prepare to fire on my order.

152
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:26,483
Hold your fire.
In the Beast's clutches the Chancellor is.

153
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:28,963
Anakin might be with him,
and Senator Amidala.

154
00:14:29,044 --> 00:14:32,324
If the Beast falls,
at risk their lives shall be.

155
00:14:44,724 --> 00:14:47,124
I've got an idea, but it's risky.

156
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,684
Considering the circumstances,
I'll take the risk.

157
00:14:53,844 --> 00:14:56,283
I've got a bad feeling about this.

158
00:14:57,966 --> 00:15:00,725
Sir, looks like
the General's up to something.

159
00:15:02,965 --> 00:15:04,924
What is Skywalker doing?

160
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:10,044
It appears to be
one of Anakin's improvised plans.

161
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:12,765
How can it be a plan if it's improvised?

162
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,565
Not to worry.
Just catch them when they fall.

163
00:15:15,644 --> 00:15:18,284
A lot of the General's plans involve falling.

164
00:15:18,364 --> 00:15:21,964
Distract the Beast we shall,
to give Skywalker more time.

165
00:15:47,724 --> 00:15:49,244
I hope you know what you're doing.

166
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:52,763
Here's where the fun begins. Hang on!

167
00:16:07,005 --> 00:16:08,365
Catch it!

168
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:32,924
Ani!

169
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,964
All pilots, fire.

170
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,964
Sir, we have to get you out of here.

171
00:17:50,325 --> 00:17:51,725
Artoo, get over there!

172
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:59,285
It can't carry both of us. You go, sir.

173
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,084
Oh, no!

174
00:18:12,446 --> 00:18:16,044
- We aren't having much of an effect!
- Time to leave, it is.

175
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,044
Oh, no!

176
00:18:24,526 --> 00:18:25,804
Let's go!

177
00:18:32,285 --> 00:18:34,044
Use the gas bombs!

178
00:18:34,366 --> 00:18:35,644
Copy that.

179
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:42,525
Bombs away!

180
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:31,564
It's a tragedy that the Zillo Beast
paid with its life for our mistakes.

181
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,165
I will make certain that sacrifice
was not made in vain.

182
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,205
Doctor, a word if you please.

183
00:20:46,285 --> 00:20:47,885
Your new orders.

184
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,685
What is this?

185
00:20:49,846 --> 00:20:52,685
You want me to clone the Beast?
