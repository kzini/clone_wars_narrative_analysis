1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
<i>Ahsoka Tano captured!</i>

2
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,910
<i>While on the run to prove her innocence,</i>

3
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,140
<i>Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress</i>

4
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,110
<i>to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.</i>

5
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,510
<i>The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker</i>

6
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,520
<i>and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down</i>

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,690
<i>and bring her back to the Temple.</i>

8
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,490
<i>Now captured and imprisoned,</i>

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,230
<i>Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.</i>

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,090
<i>The Senate requests
that Ahsoka Tano be indicted</i>

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>for acts of treason
against the Republic.</i>

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,980
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,340
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,000
<i>Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.</i>

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:59,670
<i>I'm afraid, Master Yoda,</i>

16
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:03,210
<i>that the Senate believes
that an internal Jedi trial</i>

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,450
<i>would seem biased.</i>

18
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,080
<i>Therefore, the Senate asks</i>

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,980
<i>that the Council expel
Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order</i>

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,820
<i>so that she may be put
to a Republic Military tribunal,</i>

21
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,220
<i>where she will receive
more impartial judgment.</i>

22
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,960
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

23
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,630
<i>That would be up
to the Council, General,</i>

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,800
<i>but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.</i>

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,400
Of course.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,010
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

27
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,710
Thank you, Admiral.

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,710
Surely we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

29
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,210
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,520
And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,380
the mastermind behind the attack
on the Temple.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,050
She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,360
This alone is enough to convict her.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,140
I understand your sentiment,
Obi-Wan,

35
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,730
but if the Council does as you suggest,

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,660
it could be seen as an act of opposition

37
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,260
to the Senate.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm afraid we have little choice.

39
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,640
Hmm.

40
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,180
To the Chamber of Judgment,

41
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,870
summon Skywalker and his Padawan,

42
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,880
and in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,620
You're not helping.

44
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,860
I'm sorry, Snips.

45
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,660
I just... I just don't know
what to do.

46
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:39,760
It's okay.

47
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,030
I don't either.

48
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,610
Padawan Tano,

49
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,900
serious charges
have been levied against you.

50
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,740
How plead you?

51
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,350
Not guilty, Master.

52
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,140
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

53
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,110
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

54
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,350
There is evidence to the contrary.

55
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,790
You were alone with
Letta Turmond when she died.

56
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,580
Can you explain this?

57
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,390
Someone used the Force against her.

58
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,090
Which brings us to Ventress.

59
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,590
Can you explain your association
with her?

60
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,560
We had a mutual understanding.

61
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,960
I thought she was helping me.

62
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,030
Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,430
found when you were apprehended,

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,670
the same devices used
in the bombing of the Temple?

65
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,300
No, I was set up and deceived,

66
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,440
as you are being deceived now.

67
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:05,710
The question is, Padawan Tano,

68
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,740
who is deceiving us?

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:10,210
Ventress, you, or someone else?

70
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,150
I am not deceiving you.

71
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,450
I would assume Ventress is,

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,020
but I can't be sure.

73
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,820
My sense is clouded.

74
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,620
Clouded by the dark side

75
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,820
these things are, Padawan Tano.

76
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,720
Dangerously clouded,

77
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,760
but not just surrounding you,

78
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,640
surrounding many things in these times.

79
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,400
You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

80
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,800
This meeting is just a formality!

81
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,230
Reached a decision, we have,

82
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,070
though not in total agreement are we.

83
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,310
It is the Council's opinion

84
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,610
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano
has committed sedition

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,080
against the Republic,

86
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,620
and thus, she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

87
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,050
You can't do this!

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,120
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

89
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,490
and you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

90
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,270
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

91
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,370
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts

92
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,890
to await your trail

93
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,760
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

94
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,370
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

95
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,280
Padm has agreed to represent
you before the Senate.

96
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,690
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

97
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,090
I am almost certain
that the person behind this

98
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,290
is Ventress,

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,790
and you know I wasn't working with her.

100
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,460
She was at the warehouse...

101
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,460
in the room.

102
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,060
We fought, but she got away.

103
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,370
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

104
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,100
No, none of the clones
reported seeing Ventress

105
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,670
at the scene.

106
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,040
I thought you said Ventress left

107
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,810
before you went into the warehouse.

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,310
That's what I thought, too,

109
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,750
but then she attacked me
when I got inside.

110
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,350
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,150
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

112
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,190
Wait, where are you going?

113
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,700
You can't leave now.

114
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,890
Yes, I can.

115
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,090
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

116
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,260
Until we hear from Anakin,

117
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,960
let's work on your defense.

118
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,470
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

119
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,970
I thought I was part of that Order,

120
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,540
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

121
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,810
I'm not holding out much hope

122
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,790
the Senate will treat me any better.

123
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,740
Anakin Skywalker.

124
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,760
I know you're behind all of this.

125
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,550
Prove it.

126
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,260
Leave me alone.

127
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,570
Tell me what happened.

128
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,280
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

129
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,280
I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

130
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,020
Bounty?

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,780
I was going to catch your pet

132
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:02,180
and turn her over to the authorities,

133
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,990
collect whatever bounty was due.

134
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
What stopped you?

135
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,730
At first... I admit... I was
just interested in the money

136
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,060
and a little bit of revenge,

137
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,530
but then I realized
your fallen Padawan and I

138
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
had a lot in common.

139
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,070
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

140
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,440
It's true.

141
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,940
My master abandoned me,

142
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,920
and that's exactly what you did to her,

143
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,750
you and your precious Jedi Order.

144
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,540
Ahsoka Tano,

145
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,670
you have been charged with sedition

146
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:43,380
against the Jedi Order
and the Republic itself.

147
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,910
This court will decide your fate.

148
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,980
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

149
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,220
Former Padawan Tano,

150
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,920
I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

151
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,760
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple

152
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,760
and that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

153
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:07,770
you eliminated them one by one.

154
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
When you are found guilty,

155
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,970
I ask the court
that the full extent of the law

156
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,510
be brought down upon you,

157
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,440
including penalty of death.

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,210
After I left the warehouse,

159
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,380
after I left your little Padawan alone,

160
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,750
I was walking away,

161
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,920
and I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

162
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,420
But I was wrong.

163
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,690
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

164
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,830
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

165
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,200
It had to be another Jedi.

166
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,570
I don't believe you.

167
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,900
Believe it.

168
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,900
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

169
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:48,070
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

170
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,170
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

171
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,140
You're the only one
Ahsoka had talked to.

172
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,080
That's not true.

173
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,960
What do you mean?

174
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,450
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

175
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,120
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

176
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,090
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

177
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,460
in the first place.

178
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,360
It was this Barriss
that told us to go there.

179
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,200
If you're lying, you're dead.

180
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,430
Such promises.

181
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,840
Look at the facts.

182
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,570
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

183
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,710
to reveal the name
of the true mastermind

184
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,610
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

185
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,010
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

186
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,880
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

187
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,510
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

188
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,750
Letta Turmond was strangled to death

189
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,350
by way of the Force.

190
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,920
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

191
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,890
with a method that would so obviously

192
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,760
tie the murder to her?

193
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,960
A Jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

194
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,170
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

195
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,730
Members of the court,

196
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,640
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,040
Well said, Senator Amidala.

198
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,240
However, if she is innocent,

199
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,850
then why was she seen conspiring
with known Separatist terrorist.

200
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,250
Asajj Ventress?

201
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,850
Ventress set me up.

202
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,780
My master will prove that.

203
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,020
And where is your master?

204
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,960
He's trying to find the real murderer.

205
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:25,060
Then maybe he should be looking at you.

206
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,350
Enter.

207
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:54,450
Barriss, I need to talk to you.

208
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,020
Master Skywalker,

209
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,860
how can I help you?

210
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,990
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka

211
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,330
before she was arrested.

212
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,160
What did you say to her?

213
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,430
We've been friends for a long time.

214
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,330
I was only trying to help her.

215
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,030
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

216
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,560
It's no trouble.

217
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,030
I just need to know what you told her

218
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,500
and if you told anyone else.

219
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,400
No, I thought I had a clue for her,

220
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,370
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

221
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,270
Who told you I spoke to her?

222
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,910
Ventress.

223
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,480
She told me.

224
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,020
Ventress?

225
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,950
Isn't she the one Ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

226
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,690
That's what Ahsoka says,

227
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,950
but I think she's wrong.

228
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,390
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

229
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,300
And you believe her?

230
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,690
Who else could it be if not her?

231
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,030
Surely not Ahsoka.

232
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,300
No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either.

233
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,830
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth,

234
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,070
but there's only one way to find out.

235
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,540
Funny. Those belong to Ventress.

236
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,210
You should've gotten rid of them!

237
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,980
I think they suit me.

238
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:12,050
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi

239
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,690
and think, "Surely
she cannot be this murderer"

240
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,660
or saboteur that they speak of."

241
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,960
And yet think of all the times
we have been fooled

242
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,900
by the Separatists

243
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,110
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic

244
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,300
and ask yourself,

245
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,210
"Is this yet another
Separatist scheme?"

246
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,240
Another way to rip the Jedi,

247
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,180
and subsequently all of us,

248
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,810
apart.

249
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,520
Ahsoka trusted you,
and you betrayed her.

250
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,260
I've learned that trust is overrated.

251
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,540
The only thing
the Jedi Council believes in

252
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,760
is violence.

253
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,290
Cease hostility!

254
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,650
Barriss!

255
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
Look out!

256
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,510
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

257
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,950
Ahsoka Tano,

258
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,490
by an overwhelming count of...

259
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,990
Chancellor.

260
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,230
I hope you have a reason

261
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,930
for bursting into our proceedings,

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,230
Master Skywalker.

263
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,470
I'm here with evidence and a confession

264
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,470
from the person responsible
for all the crimes.

265
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,470
Ahsoka has been accused of.

266
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,640
Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order

267
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,250
and traitor.

268
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,720
Barriss, is that true?

269
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,720
Tell them the truth.

270
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,160
I did it

271
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,990
because I've come to realize

272
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,530
what many of people in the Republic

273
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,030
have come to realize,

274
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,930
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

275
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,670
that we've so lost our way

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,150
that we have become villains
in this conflict,

277
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,670
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

278
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,840
all of us!

279
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,940
And my attack on the Temple
was an attack

280
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,680
on what the Jedi have become,

281
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,690
an army fighting for the dark side,

282
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,420
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

283
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,730
This Republic is failing!

284
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,760
It's only a matter of time.

285
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,230
Take her away.

286
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,910
Ahsoka,

287
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,350
I am so sorry

288
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,660
about everything.

289
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,060
You have our most humble apologies,

290
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,960
little 'Soka.

291
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,060
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

292
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,670
You have shown such
great strength and resilience

293
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:46,100
in your struggle
to prove your innocence.

294
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:49,470
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

295
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,440
This was actually your great trial.

296
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,410
Now we see that.

297
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,180
We understand that the Force
works in mysterious ways,

298
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,950
and because of this trial,

299
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:03,700
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

300
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,620
Back into the Order you may come.

301
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,190
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

302
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,070
<i>I'm</i> asking you back.

303
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,590
I'm sorry, Master,

304
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,230
but I'm not coming back.

305
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,230
Ahsoka, wait!

306
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,240
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

307
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,100
Why are you doing this?

308
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,310
The Council didn't trust me,

309
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:40,710
so how can I trust myself?

310
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,440
What about me?

311
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,080
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

312
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,980
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

313
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:50,180
and I'm grateful for that.

314
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,420
But this isn't about you.

315
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,620
I can't stay here any longer,

316
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,590
not now.

317
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,830
The Jedi Order is your life.

318
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:02,430
You can't just throw it away like this.

319
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,560
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

320
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:09,770
Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

321
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,370
without the Council

322
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,240
and without you.

323
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,080
I understand.

324
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:20,260
More than you realize,

325
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,920
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

326
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:28,890
I know.
