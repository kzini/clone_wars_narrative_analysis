1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,300
<i>Terror at the Temple!</i>

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:22,340
<i>The Jedi Temple is in disarray</i>

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,640
<i>after a vicious terrorist attack.</i>

4
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,710
<i>Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano</i>

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,010
<i>set out to find the truth</i>

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,010
<i>of who was really behind
this horrendous catastrophe.</i>

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,380
<i>Their investigation led them
to discover the true saboteur,</i>

8
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,050
<i>Letta Turmond.</i>

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,320
<i>Now the Jedi attempt to return
the Temple to normalcy.</i>

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,050
<i>But first Master Yoda must give a eulogy</i>

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,620
<i>to the fallen Jedi warriors.</i>

12
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,820
One with the Force, they are.

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,590
And our job it is
to remember that we will,

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:54,260
in time, also pass on.

15
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:56,190
Luminous beings are we,

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,960
but temporary vessels, our bodies are.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,300
And we shall all find ourselves
here in time.

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,330
A moment of silence, I ask,

19
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,070
to remember and to move on.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,110
You were close to one of them?

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,870
Tutso Mara.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,540
We trained together.

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,010
He taught me how to hold
my lightsaber correctly.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:26,280
Live for the living Jedi, we must.

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,020
Live through us, forever they will.

26
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,700
So what happens to Letta now?

27
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,940
The bomber has been moved.

28
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,040
Moved?

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,100
Where?

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,210
Why should she be moved?

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,940
The Republic military
has taken her into custody.

32
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,470
But why?

33
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,710
This is a Jedi matter, isn't it?

34
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,050
Clones were killed,

35
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,710
which makes this terrorist attack

36
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,410
a military matter.

37
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,820
An attack on the Jedi
is an attack on the Senate.

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:15,650
Admiral Tarkin is right.

39
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,450
Letta isn't a Jedi.

40
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,220
It's not for us to be judge and jury

41
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,690
over a citizen of the Republic.

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,190
If Letta's guilty, she's guilty,

43
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,160
and she should be dealt with.

44
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,590
Calm down, Ahsoka.

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,130
Remember, revenge is not the Jedi way.

46
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,230
The evidence seems clear, Ahsoka.

47
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,576
Nothing will ever change.

48
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,530
The Chancellor feels very strongly

49
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,830
that the Jedi be removed

50
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,370
from as many military matters
as possible.

51
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,580
You yourselves
said that you're peacekeepers,

52
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,440
not soldiers.

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,350
I hope Chancellor Palpatine
knows what he's doing.

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,580
I assure you
that he rarely does anything

55
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,210
without a strategy.

56
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,350
I have many things
to attend to, Masters.

57
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,050
Good day.

58
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,590
Ahsoka.

59
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,960
Go.

60
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,990
Be with your friend, Ahsoka.

61
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,600
In ways, she is still very young.

62
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,160
Indeed.

63
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,130
Company?

64
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,570
Sure.

65
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,470
Every time I think about this,
I feel conflicted.

66
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,116
It's hard not to let feelings
turn into attachment and pain.

67
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,570
Ahsoka, have you ever wondered

68
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,840
if it was right to ignore your emotions?

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,680
My Master would say,

70
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:46,680
"Our struggle as Jedi
is to move past them."

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
You make it sound so easy.

72
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,080
No, it isn't easy.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,390
But it's possible.

74
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,550
Like, when we were stuck

75
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,390
inside the battle tank on Geonosis,

76
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,560
it was hard not to be afraid.

77
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,660
Still, you and I got past it.

78
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,230
And I guess we'll get past this.

79
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,030
You've always been capable
of seeing things clearly.

80
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:08,490
I guess I've fooled you
like I have everyone else.

81
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,270
Yes, Master.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,230
Ahsoka, we're needed in the war room.

83
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,640
It appears the Separatists
have mounted another attack.

84
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,340
Coming, Master.

85
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:21,740
Look, I have to believe
that one way or another,

86
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,680
this woman's going to pay
for what she did.

87
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,040
You shouldn't keep your Master waiting.

88
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,450
<i>We've uncovered
a Separatist plan of attack.</i>

89
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,596
<i>We shall travel
to the Anoat system here,</i>

90
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,720
<i>then move across to Saleucami.</i>

91
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,830
So far out of our way?

92
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,260
<i>Unfortunately, we must avoid
these neutral systems.</i>

93
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,890
<i>Excuse me, Master Jedi.</i>

94
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,090
Yes, Admiral.

95
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,760
<i>Commander Tano,</i>

96
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,460
<i>your presence is requested
by prisoner Letta Turmond.</i>

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,030
The prisoner from the hangar bombing?

98
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,030
Why is she asking for Ahsoka?

99
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,240
<i>Not exactly sure.</i>

100
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,200
<i>But Commander Tano is the only person</i>

101
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,040
<i>the prisoner will speak to.</i>

102
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,210
I'll report back
with whatever I find out.

103
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,540
<i>Yes?</i>

104
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,570
<i>I'm Commander Tano.</i>

105
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
<i>Letta Turmond requested to see me.</i>

106
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,340
<i>A lot of innocent people
died in that blast.</i>

107
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,910
<i>Good job capturing her.</i>

108
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,780
All right, scan her.

109
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,620
<i>Leave your comlink and lightsabers here.</i>

110
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,820
Follow me.

111
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,070
What do you want, Letta?

112
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,440
I was told if I ever needed help,

113
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,010
you were the Jedi to contact.

114
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,630
Give us a minute, please.

115
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,920
You don't have much time, Letta,

116
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,250
so I suggest you get
whatever you have to say

117
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,890
off your chest.

118
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,190
The idea of feeding Jackar
the nano-droids was not mine.

119
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,700
Why are you saying this now?

120
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,630
Why didn't you reveal this before?

121
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,930
Because my life is in danger.

122
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,870
The person behind this
will be able to get to me

123
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,000
unless you know the truth.

124
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,340
Huh. What's the truth?

125
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,670
A Jedi.

126
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,910
A Jedi showed me how to create the bomb

127
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,970
and how to put
the nano-droids in.

128
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,510
Why would a Jedi do this?

129
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,550
There are some citizens
of the Republic, like myself,

130
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,220
who believe the Jedi Order
is not what it used to be.

131
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,350
The Jedi have become warmongers.

132
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,190
They've become military weapons.

133
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,320
And they're killing

134
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,550
when they should be keeping the peace.

135
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,890
One of these Jedi agreed with us.

136
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,460
One of you wanted to make a statement

137
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,230
and was willing to attack
your own order to do it.

138
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,260
Who?

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,760
If you protect me, I will tell you,

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,830
because it is obvious to me
that I have been set up.

141
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,270
Letta, you have to tell me
who is behind this.

142
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,270
It's...

143
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,310
Letta!

144
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,340
Letta!

145
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,410
Letta!

146
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,510
Prisoner health critical,

147
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,180
holding cell 173.

148
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,780
Commander Fox, the prisoner.

149
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,210
Follow me.

150
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,950
Letta!

151
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,960
I... don't know what happened.

152
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,330
Commander, she's dead.

153
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,160
I can't say I blame you, Commander Tano.

154
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,130
But all the same, you're under arrest.

155
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:45,276
I... No, no.

156
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
I did not do this.

157
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,690
Admiral Tarkin,
I don't know what happened.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,600
I went in the room to talk to Letta,

159
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,070
and she said she was afraid of a Jedi.

160
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,570
You don't have to tell me
any more, Commander Tano.

161
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,840
I don't?

162
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,670
No.

163
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,040
There are recorders in every room.

164
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,980
Curiously, the sound
isn't working on this one.

165
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,600
It seems the Jedi
she was afraid of was you.

166
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,120
I did not kill that woman.

167
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,650
You were the only one there.

168
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,090
I know that you were upset
when this woman

169
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,380
was taken into custody by the military.

170
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,720
That means nothing.

171
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,990
I beg to differ.

172
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,940
It was someone else, Admiral,

173
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,940
someone I didn't see.

174
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,540
You know that is very difficult

175
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,380
for me to believe.

176
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,480
This is a secure facility.

177
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,656
We do not have
just anyone running about.

178
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,080
And if there was someone else,

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,750
why did you not sense them?

180
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,630
I said my Padawan is in there.

181
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,100
Now, step aside.

182
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,900
General Skywalker,

183
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,300
Admiral Tarkin has ordered
that no one be allowed in there.

184
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I don't care what she's accused of.

185
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:37,640
Let me in.

186
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,310
Sorry, sir.

187
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,650
The admiral's orders stand.

188
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,780
This is now a military operation

189
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,180
and under his jurisdiction.

190
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,970
A key card.

191
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,920
Master, I knew you wouldn't let me down.

192
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,450
I wonder what you have planned.

193
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,030
Oh, no.

194
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,660
This does not look good.

195
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,900
My lightsabers.

196
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,310
Hello?

197
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,840
Who is this?

198
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,510
Why are you helping me?

199
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
What's going on here?

200
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,910
It wasn't me.

201
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,810
Alert! Alert!

202
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,680
The Jedi prisoner has escaped.

203
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,730
Commander Tano, stop!

204
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,770
She's heading north
in the prison corridor.

205
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,070
Cut her off!

206
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,330
Copy that.

207
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,550
Oh, no.

208
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,260
The suspect has killed three clones.

209
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,360
Code red.

210
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,120
If you see the target, shoot to kill.

211
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,620
Belay that order, Commander Fox.

212
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,630
She's killed troopers.

213
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,160
I know Commander Tano.

214
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
She would never do something like this.

215
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,100
Then who did?

216
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,170
Quiet!

217
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,400
Ahsoka!

218
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,340
It's me, Anakin.

219
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,310
Stop running.

220
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,170
You can't help me, Master.

221
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,980
Someone's setting me up.

222
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,040
I believe you, Ahsoka.

223
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,750
But no one else will.

224
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Keep searching until we find her.

225
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,720
Rex, call security.

226
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,920
Tell them we need
to search the entire base.

227
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,990
Now!

228
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
General Skywalker has just issued

229
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,360
an all-points bulletin
on Commander Ahsoka Tano.

230
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,730
She's killed three clones

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,090
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

232
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,610
The prisoner was just spotted
in the east wing,

233
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,860
cell block 1218-11.

234
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,530
Come on, Grizzer.

235
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,970
There's nothing here.

236
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,510
There she is!

237
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,670
Quick, stop her
before she gets to the ship!

238
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,960
All right, don't lose her.
We'll be right there.

239
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,110
What's going on?

240
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,930
We've found her.

241
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:06,850
She's heading towards
the industrial pipeline.

242
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,520
Set weapons to stun.

243
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,720
I want her alive!

244
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,056
Do not shoot to kill.

245
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Do not shoot to kill!

246
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,097
Try to box her in.

247
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,220
Don't let her escape.

248
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:02,120
Tell me what you see, Oddball.

249
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,800
She's moving west
along the central viaduct.

250
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,640
All right, we got her now.

251
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,950
This will knock her off her feet.

252
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,030
Not so fast, Commander.

253
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,520
Ahsoka!

254
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,750
Ahsoka, what are you doing?

255
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:14,390
You didn't even try to come and help me.

256
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,050
They wouldn't let me in to talk to you.

257
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,190
You could have if you tried.

258
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,560
How would that look, Ahsoka, huh?

259
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,760
Forcing my way in

260
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,390
would've made you look even more guilty.

261
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,590
I'm not guilty!

262
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:28,000
Then we have to prove you're innocent.

263
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,600
The only way we can do that
is by going back.

264
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,730
I don't know who to trust.

265
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,940
Listen, I would never
let anyone hurt you, Ahsoka,

266
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,140
never.

267
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,800
But you need to come back

268
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,570
and make your case to the Council.

269
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,140
No.

270
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,386
I'm not going to take the fall
for something I didn't do!

271
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,450
I am ordering you
to put down your lightsaber

272
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,980
and come with me now!

273
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,050
Trust me.

274
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,650
General Skywalker, where are you?

275
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,150
I do trust you.

276
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,220
But you know as well as I do

277
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,620
that no one else will believe me.

278
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:07,450
Anakin, you have to trust <i>me</i> now.

279
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,460
Ahsoka, I do trust you.

280
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,160
I know you do.

281
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,530
Wish me luck.
