1
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,780
Captured!

2
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,290
Returning from a perilous assignment
in the Outer Rim,

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,750
Jedi Master Even Piell's cruiser
has fallen under attack and been boarded.

4
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,010
Seeking vital information he carries

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,970
about secret hyperspace lanes
called the Nexus Route,

6
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,300
Separatist forces have taken him alive.

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,230
Now, the Jedi are preparing
a stealth mission

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,010
into the heart of Separatist space
in an effort to rescue Master Piell

9
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,310
from the deadly prison
known as the Citadel.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,270
As you are aware,
the Citadel is their most isolated

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,740
and impenetrable detention facility.

12
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,070
No one has ever escaped.

13
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:55,090
There's a first time for everything.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,490
Indeed there is.

15
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,700
Their security has prevented our probes
from obtaining recent reconnaissance,

16
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,160
so we've been forced
to construct a crude map

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,580
based upon data from the archives.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,540
And since the data is extremely old,
the map will be difficult to rely on.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,840
So we're essentially going in blind.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,710
Beg your pardon, General,

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,720
but how do we know
Master Piell is still alive?

22
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,970
The Separatists won't dare kill Master
Piell until they have what they need.

23
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,470
He obtained the coordinates

24
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,190
of a secret hyperspace lane
known as the Nexus Route

25
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,310
which travels into the heart of both
the Republic and Separatist homeworlds.

26
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,820
They could prove vital
in maneuvering our forces

27
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,650
deep into remote Separatist sectors.

28
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,360
Or the enemy could use them
to slip through our defenses

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,740
and attack Coruscant.

30
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,700
These hyperspace lanes are of
immense interest to both our sides,

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,080
and could tip the scale of the war
to whomever is in possession of them.

32
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,220
That is all.

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,710
Based on the archive schematics,
we've narrowed it down

34
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,880
to three possible locations
they could be holding him at.

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,230
My greatest concern is infiltrating
their outer security.

36
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,220
The life-form scanners
will not be easy to fool.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,390
I've got a thought about that.

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,520
Master! I'm sorry I'm late.
I just heard about the briefing.

39
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,440
We're going to rescue Master Piell, right?

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,570
You two have much to discuss.

41
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,410
Ahsoka,
I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier,

42
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,000
but you won't be coming along on this one.

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,370
Not coming?
But you're breaking into the Citadel!

44
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,910
No one's ever done it.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,710
The Citadel wasn't designed
to hold common criminals.

46
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,090
It was created to hold Jedi
if any of us lost our way.

47
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,420
It's not a place for Padawans.

48
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:42,090
You're just being protective again.

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,560
That's not fair. How am I supposed to learn
if you won't let me share the risk?

50
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:50,270
This isn't a mission for learning.
You either do or die.

51
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,270
And that's not a risk I'm willing to share.

52
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,740
Artoo! Look out! Behind you!
You're being followed by battle droids!

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,290
These are your troops?
They're battle droids!

54
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,630
What do you mean, they've been
reprogrammed to follow your orders?

55
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,760
We are awaiting your word, Commander.

56
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,300
You heard him. Move out!

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,140
Don't you go thumbing your gears at me

58
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,940
just because you have a bunch of
dim-witted droids following you about!

59
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,140
Really.

60
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,070
We're trusting those droids
to get us into the Citadel?

61
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,490
It's the only way. We're flying right
into the heart of Separatist territory.

62
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,570
Droids won't be detected.

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,160
Artoo.

64
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,130
Make sure they don't stray
from the flight plan.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,920
It's all under control, sir.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was talking to Artoo.

67
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,180
Master Plo? May I speak with you?

68
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,470
What is it, little 'Soka?

69
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:12,020
It's about the mission.
Master Skywalker doesn't want me to go.

70
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,530
That is his choice.

71
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:21,150
I know.
But I think he's being overly protective.

72
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:24,700
He's picking and choosing
which assignments I can be a part of.

73
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,320
He is your master.

74
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,870
Yes, but it's not for him to decide

75
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,370
when and how
I should put my life in danger.

76
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,330
That should be my choice.

77
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,670
I've never been carbon-frozen
before, General.

78
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,840
It's the first time for us, too.

79
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,720
This is your idea? Carbon freezing?

80
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,220
Hey, you wanted to shield us
from the life-form scanners.

81
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,480
Are we sure this thing is safe?

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,060
I don't want to end up a wall decoration.

83
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,730
Try to relax.
We'll be unfrozen as soon as we arrive.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,370
May the Force be with you.

85
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:14,850
Citadel Command has contacted us.

86
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,440
This is Central Command.
Please identify yourself.

87
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,820
This is cargo shuttle 1138,
requesting access to Citadel prison.

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,870
Make sure every part of that ship
is scanned for life forms.

89
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,200
Yes, Commander.

90
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,170
Make no mistake. The Jedi will be
coming for their imprisoned brother.

91
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,210
They're not about to let
one of their own be tortured

92
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,300
into handing over information that will
help the Separatists win the war.

93
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,300
What is your cargo?

94
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,850
What is our cargo?

95
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,030
Supplies and frozen rations.

96
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,400
Do not deviate from your current course

97
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,320
until we have confirmed your cargo.

98
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,780
They're scanning us for life forms.

99
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:24,040
I don't think this is working.

100
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,290
Quiet! You're gonna blow it.

101
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,980
The shuttle has no life forms, Commander.

102
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,150
Scan complete. You may proceed.

103
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,820
Fear. A Jedi spends his whole life
training against it.

104
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,240
But at the Citadel,
breaking Jedi is our specialty.

105
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,210
Within these walls,
they will learn to fear us.

106
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,420
And if not, they die.

107
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,830
- Hey, Snips.
- Hey, Master.

108
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,340
I must have carbon sickness,
because I could swear that's Ahsoka.

109
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,550
Your eyes are fine.
It's Ahsoka's hearing that needs help.

110
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,640
I received orders to join the team.
I thought you knew.

111
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,600
Orders? From who?

112
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,950
I discussed it with Master Plo.

113
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,650
He didn't tell me.

114
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,020
You were already in carbonite.

115
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,360
Well, I gave you a specific order
not to come!

116
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,160
If there's one thing I've learned
from you, Master,

117
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,490
it's that following direct orders isn't
always the best way to solve a problem.

118
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,040
I see Anakin's new teaching method
is to "Do as I say, not as I do."

119
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,830
Welcome aboard.

120
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,380
Guard the shuttle, Artoo.

121
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,640
We'll contact you
when we're ready for take-off.

122
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,200
- I see the entry point.
- You were right.

123
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,040
The wind conditions are too strong
for jetpacks.

124
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,700
Yes. We'll have to do it
the old-fashioned way,

125
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,580
with ascension cables and a steel grip.

126
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:13,210
- I don't think so.
- What do you mean?

127
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,090
Electro-mines.

128
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,170
There's nowhere to put a grappling hook
at that height,

129
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:22,890
and we hit one of those, the
mission's over. They'll know we're here.

130
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:26,220
I suppose that means we free-climb it.

131
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,200
You hanging in there, Snips?

132
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,580
Couldn't be better.

133
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,910
I could do without the wind, though.

134
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,380
The entry point is just a few more meters.

135
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,930
They locked the door! It's ray-shielded!

136
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,470
Ray-shielded? That wasn't the plan!

137
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,640
Well, it's in the plan now.

138
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,390
There's an opening up there.

139
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,490
We know. They're ventilation ducts.

140
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,780
But they're far too small
for us to gain access.

141
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,990
Too small for you, maybe,
but I think I can squeeze through.

142
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,420
Well, we hadn't planned
on Ahsoka being here. Perhaps she's right.

143
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,600
See? I can handle myself after all.

144
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,150
Sir, one of the cargo shuttles was
cleared for landing but never arrived.

145
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,120
Charger!

146
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,550
Well, they know we're here.

147
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Sir, a mine in sector 9-G was
just detonated.

148
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,020
Mindless droids!

149
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,600
Activate all security protocols!
Lock everything down!

150
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,480
Where are my special units?

151
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,530
They are here, sir.

152
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,000
Clear.

153
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,670
Take out their surveillance.

154
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,780
The walls are electrified. Go! Go, go, go!

155
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,070
Longshot!

156
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,870
We must keep moving.

157
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,590
You're weakening.

158
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:34,800
You decide when the pain will stop.
Just give me the information.

159
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,720
No droid will ever break me.

160
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,940
Say goodbye to your one good eye.

161
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,320
Secure the entrance!

162
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,080
Master Piell, are you all right?

163
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,750
Obi-Wan. What took you guys so long?

164
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,500
At least your sense
of humor is still intact.

165
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,170
It takes more than they got to break me,
young Skywalker.

166
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,690
So you have the coordinates
for the Nexus Route?

167
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,260
I got them, all right.

168
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,010
Half of them, anyway.

169
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,100
My captain's got the other half.

170
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,900
I erased the computers
when we were boarded

171
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,560
and had both of us memorize
part of the intel.

172
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,860
That way, if somehow I cracked,

173
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,900
the information would be useless to them
without the other half.

174
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,540
Where's your captain?

175
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,660
Being held with the other officers,
I assume.

176
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,950
We're gonna need a new plan
for getting out.

177
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,210
We need to keep moving.

178
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Anakin!

179
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,340
Master!

180
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:48,440
You fools! I hope you enjoyed
the reunion with your fellow Jedi,

181
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:53,110
because you're going to be my guests
for a very long time!

182
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,410
They're magnetized.

183
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,420
Oh, no, you don't.

184
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,440
- Are you all right, sir?
- Yeah. Let's get out of here.

185
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
I hear something.

186
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,360
General.

187
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,860
Captain Tarkin.

188
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,530
I never thought I'd see you again.

189
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,530
And you brought friends.

190
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:22,200
Tarkin, this is Obi-Wan Kenobi
and Anakin Skywalker.

191
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,870
Well, now that you've found us,
how do you expect to get us out?

192
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,510
If they've locked this fortress down,
there's at least ten squads on their way.

193
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,960
It's going to be impossible to escape.

194
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,750
What if we split up?
My team will create a diversion,

195
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,670
while Anakin leads the others away.
That way, if one of us is captured,

196
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,090
the enemy will only have part
of the information and not all of it.

197
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,060
General Kenobi, I think it's better
if we stick together.

198
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,350
A stronger force
would have a better chance

199
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:52,730
- of protecting the information.
- Not in this situation.

200
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:57,530
But surely we'd have more strength
in numbers, rather than divide us.

201
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:02,450
Obi-Wan has a point. I'll go with him,
you go with Skywalker.

202
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,310
They escaped, sir.

203
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,980
Captain, show this droid what happens
when we use that word.

204
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,110
Sir! They've been spotted
heading for the upper levels.

205
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,620
They're trying to steal a transport.

206
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,580
Seal the landing platform
and send all battalions to their positions.

207
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,330
Bring them back alive.

208
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,100
Hey!

209
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,970
Everybody in.

210
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,020
This is one of the
original fortress tunnels.

211
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,890
The advantage of old archive data.

212
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,730
The tunnel's clear!

213
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,190
Looks like Obi-Wan's distraction worked.
Things seem to be going as planned.

214
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,030
It's when things do not go as planned
that concerns me.

215
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,910
- What then?
- It's when things don't go as planned

216
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,950
that we Jedi are at our best. Trust me.

217
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:20,050
I reserve my trust for those
who take action, General Skywalker.

218
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,760
Then let me remind you,
we rescued you back there.

219
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,380
And I reserve my trust

220
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,890
for those who understand gratitude,
Captain Tarkin.
