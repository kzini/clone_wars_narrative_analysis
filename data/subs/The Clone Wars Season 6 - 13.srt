1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,490
Darkness on Dagobah!

2
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,040
All attention is focused on Yoda,

3
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,210
who claims
to hear the voice of a long-dead Jedi.

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,290
Convinced that he is guided
by Qui-Gon Jinn,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,920
he finds five priestesses

6
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,060
who will teach him how
to manifest consciousness after death.

7
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,310
After many trials,
Yoda travels to Moraband,

8
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,220
ancient home planet of the Sith.

9
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:46,310
For now he must face the true evil
that may be his undoing

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,980
and one that seeks
to control the galaxy.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,780
- Careful, we must be.

12
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:01,410
Deserted, this planet was,
long ago, after many wars.

13
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,450
- Again, leave you, I must, my friend.

14
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,490
Guard the ship, you will.

15
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,790
If return, I do not, by three night falls,
take the ship to Coruscant, you shall.

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,210
- Tell them of where I went.

17
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,620
We are the Sith.

18
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,450
Afraid of you, I am not.

19
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,710
We shall see.

20
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,610
There is
no life after death.

21
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,780
Only nothingness awaits you, Jedi.

22
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,660
Your fear feeds our hunger for power.

23
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,920
They will know you are here,
we will tell them.

24
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,710
You will die and be nothing.

25
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:13,140
Sir, you have been ordered
to go to Coruscant immediately.

26
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,650
Tell Lord Sidious I am on my way.

27
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,090
Why do you come to my tomb, Jedi?

28
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,140
To learn.

29
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,310
Do you know who I am?

30
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,310
Yes.

31
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,980
Darth Bane,
the ancient Sith Lord, you are.

32
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,230
And know why I am not forgotten?

33
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,360
Created the Rule of Two, you did.

34
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,320
The Sith killed each other.

35
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:53,580
Victims of their own greed.

36
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,000
But from the ashes of destruction,
I was the last survivor.

37
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,210
I chose to pass my knowledge
on to only one.

38
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:10,130
I created a legacy so resilient
that now you come before me.

39
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,930
Have you come to be my apprentice?

40
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,350
You must kill me to gain my place.

41
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,900
Dead, you are, already.

42
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,690
Then what stands before you?

43
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,400
An illusion.

44
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,780
Real, you are not.

45
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,290
- You do not fear me?
- No.

46
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,200
Exist, you do not, anymore.

47
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,590
Yoda.

48
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,510
Yoda.

49
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,120
I sense we have a great opportunity

50
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,250
to strike a deadly blow
to the Jedi Order.

51
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
But we must act swiftly.

52
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,170
A warning, I must give you.

53
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,510
Yes.

54
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,430
All your trials you have faced
have been our doing.

55
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,600
And you have passed them well.

56
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:25,030
But inside, there is a place
where we have no control.

57
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,650
For it is a place of absolute darkness.

58
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,820
What happened here?

59
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,200
It is the chamber
where the Sith would sacrifice Jedi.

60
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,700
The Sith of your time will find you there.

61
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,620
And you will find them.

62
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:49,130
Be careful, for what they may offer
will certainly feel like an answer.

63
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,150
Only the presence of someone
significant to you

64
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,820
would allow you to sense this
ripple through time and space.

65
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,170
My old master, Yoda!

66
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,540
Yes,

67
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,420
Master Yoda has come to Moraband,

68
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,750
although why, I do not know.

69
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,260
We shall, however, use the strong bond

70
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,880
that once existed
between you and your master

71
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,060
to allow us to see things
that we otherwise could not.

72
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,770
How can this be done, Master?

73
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,320
It is an old art of the dark side.

74
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,610
Now, hold out your hand, Apprentice.

75
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:04,330
I need but a drop for the ritual to begin.

76
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,980
Now, concentrate on Master Yoda,

77
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,230
bring all your focus to him.

78
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:41,400
But will he not sense our presence?

79
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,750
We shall come to him
with a familiar face,

80
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,460
a long-lost face.

81
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:55,300
One he would be eager to see again,

82
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,090
one whom he would ask
and want answered

83
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,720
all the questions he seeks.

84
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,900
Help me.

85
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,610
Please, please free me.

86
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,740
Sifo-Dyas? Alive, you are!

87
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,740
Help me please, Yoda.

88
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:34,330
I have been imprisoned for so long.

89
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,630
Know who did this to you?

90
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,850
What if I could tell you
who the Sith Lord is?

91
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,760
Free me and I will reveal it.

92
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,930
No!

93
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,650
He knows how to achieve
what you seek.

94
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,730
Captivated by the physical realm,
the Sith are.

95
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,480
What else is there?

96
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,160
Free me and together
we can know who the Sith Lord is.

97
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,830
Gain the power you deserve,

98
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,620
and save the future.

99
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,380
- No.
- You must free me!

100
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,130
Nothing to show me, the Sith have.

101
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,340
We shall see.

102
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,970
Sidious!

103
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,690
There is no question,
the ship was carrying Count Dooku.

104
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
We've scanned the area

105
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,780
and he is meeting with someone
inside the building.

106
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,120
Thanks, Rex.

107
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,790
- Master Yoda, what are your orders?
- Orders?

108
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you all right, Master?

109
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,670
- Where am I?
- I don't understand.

110
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,340
Tell me, you must!

111
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,670
The industrial sector
on Coruscant.

112
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,340
What is happening here?

113
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,696
A rogue shuttle
slipped through the security grid.

114
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,390
- We suspect Dooku was on board.
- And?

115
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,890
Master, this is your mission.
Are you sure you're all right?

116
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,400
Clouded, the dark side has made me.

117
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,850
Tell me, who is inside?

118
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,990
We intercepted a transmission
calling Dooku to Coruscant.

119
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,650
We believe he is meeting with
his master, the Sith Lord.

120
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:29,410
Feel it, I do. Feel their power.

121
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,990
Your orders, Master?

122
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,700
Capture them, we will.

123
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,250
The time has come to discover
the identity of this Sith Master.

124
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,630
- And if they escape?
- Escape, not.

125
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:44,630
If it comes to it, execute them, we must.

126
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,340
End it now, we will.

127
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,110
Move in.

128
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,370
I've got two confirmed targets.

129
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,000
Be ready for additional unfriendlies.

130
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,260
It appears we have company.

131
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,800
Take them!

132
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,990
We meet at last, Darth Sidious.

133
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,590
You cannot stop what is to come.

134
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,260
Skywalker, no!

135
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,230
No!

136
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:59,620
Save him, Jedi? Can you save him?

137
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,340
Why not let him go?

138
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:20,640
Let him die
and you can stop all that I will do.

139
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,980
No!

140
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,310
The future is not yours yet.

141
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,190
Tempted, I will not be.

142
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,950
Sacrifice all, I am ready to do.

143
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:43,720
We have failed to break Master Yoda.

144
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,930
He is strong.

145
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,190
We will need more time
if we are to defeat him and the Jedi.

146
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:57,110
Yoda.

147
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,250
Come back to us, Yoda.

148
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,380
Died, have I?

149
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,660
In a way.

150
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,960
Now does my training begin.

151
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,460
The one you know as Qui-Gon Jinn

152
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:19,460
will commune with you
and guide your training.

153
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,010
Like us, you shall learn to maintain
your consciousness after death.

154
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,180
Enlightenment.

155
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,180
Spirit.

156
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,360
Balance.

157
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,190
There is another Skywalker.

158
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,480
There is another Skywalker?

159
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,180
Yes, time to go home, it is.

160
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,830
The Council has assembled,
they are eager to hear your report.

161
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,370
Afraid not much there is
to say of my journey.

162
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,380
So, nothing significant
happened to you out there?

163
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,350
Yes and no.

164
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,220
To the end, we are coming now.

165
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,510
Did your journey give you insight
on how to win the war?

166
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,180
No longer certain
that one ever does win a war, I am.

167
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,810
For in fighting the battles,
the bloodshed,

168
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,440
already lost, we have.

169
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,530
Yet, open to us, a path remains,

170
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,860
that, unknown to the Sith, is.

171
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,580
Through this path,
victory we may yet find.

172
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,870
Not victory in the Clone Wars,

173
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:17,540
but victory for all time.
