1
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,990
<i>Global crisis!</i>

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,080
<i>The Mid Rim рlаnet of Aleen is devаstаted
by саtаstroрhiс eаrthquаkes.</i>

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,620
<i>As the рeoрle struggle,</i>

4
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,630
<i>the future of the survivors rests
on their аbility to rekindle а wаy of life</i>

5
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,960
<i>from the rubble of the раst.</i>

6
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,260
<i>A Jedi transрort, on а mission
to block Separatist anneхation</i>

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,630
<i>of the Qiilura system,</i>

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,180
<i>is wаylаid to рrovide desрerately
needed humanitarian relief</i>

9
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,900
<i>to the рeoрle on the surfасe of Aleen.</i>

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,980
<i>Commander Wolffe,
we've been wаiting for your reрort.</i>

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,990
We've located clusters of life forms
on the planet's surface, Senator.

12
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,320
There are thousands of survivors.

13
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,150
<i>Thаt is good news.</i>

14
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,320
<i>The Aleenа will be very glаd to see you.</i>

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,660
Yes, well, my orders are to get them
on the path to rebuilding and move on.

16
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,550
General Plo needs reinforcements
as soon as possible.

17
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,340
<i>Your orders stand.</i>

18
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,000
<i>With hoрe leаve them,
but return to the wаr you must.</i>

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,090
Yes, sir. We'll start landing
procedures immediately.

20
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,730
Huh, really? Must you be so rough?

21
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,390
What, you think this is rough?
Wait till we get to the surface.

22
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,020
Traipsing through a natural disaster zone
is not my kind of diversion, Artoo.

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,730
You may be game for adventure.
I certainly am not.

24
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,610
- Oh!
- Suck it up, Shiney.

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,070
That will leave a mark.

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,010
Great, it's gonna be another one
of those planets.

27
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,300
Okay. Who packed the translator droid?

28
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,300
Hello. Hello. I'm here, Commander.

29
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,900
Oh, hello.

30
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,980
My, a local custom, I suppose. Interesting.

31
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,820
- Ah, did you get that?
- Certainly, I did.

32
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,530
Commander Wolffe, you have the honor
of meeting King Manchucho.

33
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,910
His message, simply put is,

34
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,210
"Welcome to our disaster.
Glad you could come."

35
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,800
They will save us and feed our stomachs.

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,840
The Gods below
will know peace once more.

37
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:11,100
They are expressing gratitude, Commander,

38
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,390
and the chant is a rather flowery way
of asking, "What's for dinner?"

39
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Oh, oh.

40
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,190
<i>Commander, we're eхperiencing
some settling from the originаl event.</i>

41
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,900
<i>It's to be exрeсted.</i>

42
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,690
An aftershock, everyone.

43
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,530
No, no. Please remain calm. I repeat.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,330
Well. Yes, yes. Yes, thank you.

45
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,840
It wasn't actually me,
but thank you anyway.

46
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,460
Trooper squads, scan for unstable ground.
Mark unsafe areas.

47
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,680
Let's get these cans unloaded.

48
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,900
Access and repair
of their mainframe computers is job one.

49
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,770
The R2-unit has uploaded
the Republic's reboot manuals

50
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,570
with instructions on how to make
the equipment we're leaving operational.

51
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,760
They are asking if we would
"Make peace in the ground."

52
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:26,560
We're good, but not that good.

53
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,180
- Sinker!
- Commander.

54
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,840
Take your team, the R2-unit

55
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,930
and a couple of Aleena
to the mainframe station.

56
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,390
Let's get them back online.

57
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,770
On it, sir.

58
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,250
All right, little fellas, let's go.

59
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,170
Looks like the rubble
is blocking the entry.

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,450
I got this.

61
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,910
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Boost,

62
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,450
you want what's left of the place
crashing down on our heads?

63
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,750
You worry too much.

64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,300
I could've done that!

65
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,090
After you, little guy.

66
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,150
Run metrics on structural degradation,
will you?

67
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,990
Did you find anything?

68
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,580
All right, let's get the download started.

69
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,390
Another quake?
Coming here was a bad idea.

70
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,150
I'm beginning to agree with you.

71
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:10,530
We've marked out areas
for a temporary hospital

72
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,700
and a communal kitchen here.

73
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,500
The Aleena feel great shame.

74
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,880
He is saying, first,
peace must be restored.

75
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,050
We must go inside...

76
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,720
Under... lnside.

77
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,100
He says no to the kitchen.

78
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,180
This is a relief mission.

79
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Indeed. Perhaps,
they do not allow eating in public.

80
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,610
Do I need this?

81
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:58,910
Here's how it is.

82
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,830
My orders are to deliver supplies

83
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,580
and reestablish power
and communication systems.

84
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,800
Report back to the transport

85
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,600
the moment
that R2-unit has completed the download.

86
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,420
Tell them we'll be out of their hair
in no time.

87
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,550
Splendid. A firm hand.

88
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,590
Well done, Commander, if I may say.
Well done.

89
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,270
Download in progress, Commander.

90
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,980
<i>Exсellent. Reрort bасk to the stаging аreа.</i>

91
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,980
<i>We need all hands on deck.
The droid саn finish uр.</i>

92
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:33,190
On our way, sir. All right, Artoo,
stay here and monitor the download

93
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,040
and get back to the ship
as soon as possible.

94
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,160
Watch your step, Shiney.

95
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,910
Impossible clones.

96
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,000
Hello. What have we here?

97
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,420
Something to show us?

98
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,260
I see no reason why not,
time permitting, of course.

99
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,600
Rather impatient creatures, aren't they?

100
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,470
A little diplomacy goes a long way.

101
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,020
Of course you wouldn't understand.

102
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,400
But there is no harm in humoring them.

103
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,990
Yes, yes, yes, we're coming. We're coming.

104
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,490
Artoo, keep your sensor on them,
just in case.

105
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,500
Oh, my!

106
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,670
Oh, yes, I see.

107
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,300
A sacred treasure indeed,

108
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,360
to be excavated and examined
at a later stage with the proper equipment.

109
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,020
Better to stay at a safe distance,
thank you.

110
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,240
I have a bad feeling about this.

111
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,040
Artoo!

112
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,230
Artoo, is that you?

113
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,930
I suppose that could have been worse.

114
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,520
Oh, my!

115
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,570
Now, it is.

116
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,740
There must be some way out of here.

117
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:01,170
Setting foot on this planet
was a mistake in the first place.

118
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,590
We belong on Senator Amidala's balcony,

119
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,930
watching Coruscant's glorious moons
rise above the City of Spires...

120
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,100
What was that?

121
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,440
Wait, no. Shut... Shut it off.

122
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,610
Daylight. We're saved.

123
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,940
I knew I would find a way out.

124
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,470
Look, little guy,
we're doing everything we can.

125
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,060
Has anyone seen the translator droid?

126
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,310
Okay. That's fine with me. Whatever.

127
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,570
Did you see that?

128
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,950
It's an ambush. We're under attack.

129
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Get these bugs off. Get off!

130
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,380
Artoo, help!

131
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,670
Okay. Stop! Stop!
Okay, that's quite enough.

132
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,550
Sometimes, Artoo, you go too far.

133
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,180
Why have you come?

134
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,640
I believe this tree is talking to us.

135
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:40,440
You do not belong.

136
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,360
I heartily agree.
Being here is a terrible mistake.

137
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:49,370
Go! Leave us to rest!

138
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,710
We will be happily on our way

139
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,460
if you would just point us
in the right direction.

140
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,600
Why have the surface dwellers
destroyed the peace?

141
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:05,470
To be accurate, the quakes did that.

142
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:09,140
The ground shakes

143
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,060
to keep out their foul air,

144
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,230
which poisons and destroys us.

145
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,820
The quakes have caused many to die,

146
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,230
that is why we have come to help.

147
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,940
How?

148
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,490
However we can.

149
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:30,950
There is not much time.

150
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,080
Find what you were sent here to do.

151
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:37,670
Ask Orphne.

152
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,330
She will know.

153
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,090
Yes, yes, yes,
on our way to see Orphne directly.

154
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,380
Artoo, let's get out of here.

155
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,080
My ocular sensors
seem to be malfunctioning.

156
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,840
Certainly, I remember.

157
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,880
He said the surface dwellers
destroyed the peace.

158
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,300
I don't know. Look, let's find this Orphne.

159
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,050
It seems she has all the answers.

160
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,100
Oh, my...

161
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,830
Pardon me, madam.

162
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,670
Oh...

163
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,880
I can't eat you.

164
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,220
Well, that's a relief.

165
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,140
If you are Orphne, we have come to ask...

166
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,680
How to get back?

167
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,940
Well, yes. We have lost our way.

168
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,140
There is a covenant

169
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,440
between the Aleena of old
and our subterranean world.

170
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:32,400
We survive
because the ground keeps us apart.

171
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,530
But you are apart.

172
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,340
No. The divide was breached

173
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,910
when they attacked our most sacred site.

174
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,120
Attacked?

175
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:46,380
Without going through
the natural filtering process,

176
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:50,510
the surface air is deadly to us.

177
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,260
We caused the quakes that followed.

178
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,470
But so many on the surface have died.

179
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,640
We are not destroyers by nature,

180
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,350
but we must do what is in our power
to seal the breach.

181
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:07,270
We can seal the breach,
just tell us where it is.

182
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,560
We can help.

183
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:13,110
If you have come to help us, you will help.

184
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:18,830
If you are meant to return to the surface,
you will find your way.

185
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:21,580
What? But this is a dead end.

186
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,420
You can't keep us here. This is an outrage.

187
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:30,250
Your destiny is your own.

188
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,920
Perhaps it is through
your desire to survive

189
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,840
that your greater purpose will be revealed.

190
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,760
You can run, but cannot walk.

191
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,520
You have a mouth, but cannot talk.

192
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,560
You have a head, but never weep.

193
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,530
You have a bed, but never sleep.

194
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,610
Ask yourself, who are you?

195
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,950
Wait. Wait, Orphne! Don't go!

196
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,250
Artoo, we're doomed.

197
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,960
I don't know.

198
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:10,760
What was the breach that she spoke of?

199
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,640
What was broken?

200
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,630
Artoo, hurry, replay Orphne's message.

201
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,720
Yes, riddle. I know it's a riddle.

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:22,350
That's what we're trying to figure out,
what the riddle means.

203
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,930
Just play it back, would you?

204
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,480
<i>You can run, but cannot walk.</i>

205
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,230
<i>You have a mouth, but cannot talk.</i>

206
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,230
<i>You hаve а heаd, but never weeр.</i>

207
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,820
<i>You hаve а bed, but never sleeр.</i>

208
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,570
Run, but cannot walk. Yes.

209
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,540
Have a mouth, but cannot talk. Hmm.

210
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,330
Don't worry, Artoo,
I'll figure it out very soon.

211
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,250
Riddles are my specialty.

212
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,670
Let's see. Cannot walk.
A mouth, but cannot talk.

213
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,680
What? Fire?

214
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,180
It isn't fire. Let me think.

215
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,180
Soil?

216
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,730
Of course it's not soil!

217
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,980
What are you going on about?
I nearly had it.

218
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,110
Water? Artoo, will you stop your mumbling
and let me think.

219
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,820
What are you doing now?
This is no time to clean up.

220
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,030
All this water. I detest getting wet!

221
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,460
Water. Water.

222
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,290
A river. A river! Artoo, it's a river!
That's it, I have figured it out.

223
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,630
It is a river. River is the magic word.

224
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,050
Look, it's working!

225
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,220
Oh, quick, Artoo, quick.
This might be our ticket out of here.

226
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,310
You've figured it out?

227
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,560
How could you...

228
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,630
Artoo, we've made it!

229
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,100
We're saved!

230
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,600
Oh, my! The vapors!

231
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,600
Look, Artoo. Do you see?

232
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
That is why the Aleena
cannot seal the breach,

233
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,860
the air below the ground is deadly to them,
but it has no effect on us.

234
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:40,780
I understand, Artoo. I finally understand!

235
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,950
They are waiting for us to help them.

236
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,780
They need us.

237
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:52,436
We must do what we should have done
in the first place.

238
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:55,120
We must block the hole
which leads to the underworld

239
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,250
using that seal.

240
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,720
That is the breach that Orphne spoke of.

241
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,470
Go, Artoo! You can do it!

242
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,970
What do you mean I have to help?

243
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,100
No, you are right, Artoo.

244
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,320
Oh, oh, oh! You are welcome.
I knew we would be able to help.

245
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:28,950
Hey, Shiney! You two finished with those
repairs on the computer system?

246
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:34,040
My good sir, you may not realize it,
but we have been on quite an adventure.

247
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,500
Really? Quite an adventure, huh?

248
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,880
Get a load of this one.

249
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,500
One? Which one? What... What do you...

250
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,840
Just come on,
the Commander's been looking for you.

251
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,360
You are most welcome, Your Majesty.

252
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,650
Just doing ourjob
in the service of the Republic.

253
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,260
No, Artoo, I will tell the story.
No one understands you, anyway.

254
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,050
It's only proper.

255
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,930
I am the one who solved the riddle,

256
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,730
I should be the one to relay the story.

257
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,560
I will, of course,
report on your individual heroics.

258
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,570
Do you think Senator Amidala will hold...

259
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:45,480
As soon as we rendezvous
with Master Gallia,

260
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,900
we're off-loading those two.

261
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,070
I couldn't agree more, sir.

262
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,410
Himself shall attend.

263
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,750
Dare to dream, Artoo. Dare to dream!
