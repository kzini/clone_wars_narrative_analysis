1
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,200
Battle for Ringo Vinda.

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,170
Republic forces are locked in
heated combat with the droid armada

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,040
on a massive space station
that encircles an entire planet.

4
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:30,630
Anakin Skywalker valiantly
leads his men against the onslaught,

5
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:35,380
which has lasted several rotations,
with neither side gaining any ground.

6
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,050
Aided by the twin sister Jedi Masters,
Tiplee and Tiplar,

7
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,510
the Republic now mounts
a desperate offensive

8
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,140
to break the deadlock.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,860
Push forward!

10
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,280
Stay to my left.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,070
- Fives! Watch out!

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,700
Thanks, brother, I owe you one.

13
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,130
You owe me a lot more than one.

14
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,960
Tighten our flank!

15
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,680
- Shields up!
- Yes, sir!

16
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:51,630
Don't get too comfortable.
This battle hasn't been won yet.

17
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,210
Master Skywalker,
we must get to the command post.

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,260
Admiral Trench has sent
for reinforcements.

19
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,680
We must take this post
before they arrive.

20
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,760
It's time for phase two.
We're at this position.

21
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,220
Tiplar, you'll take your men
down this passageway.

22
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,140
Tiplee, you'll move along here.

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,190
They'll have to divide their forces
to counter us.

24
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,560
And when they do,
Rex and I will press through the middle.

25
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,860
If we time it right, we'll all converge
on this spot at the same time,

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,216
and the droids won't know
what hit them.

27
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,900
If we're
making a run, we'll need backup.

28
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,910
My men are severely depleted.

29
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,950
Fives, you and Tup take
ten of your best men

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,490
and support Master Tiplar.

31
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,870
We're on it, sir.

32
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,960
Hey, you all right?

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,170
Yeah, I... I just...

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,920
Come on, this is a textbook battle.

35
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,670
We've run through this
a million times before in training.

36
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,470
Yeah, I know... I just...
I don't feel like myself.

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,230
What do you mean?

38
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,560
Follow me.

39
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,770
Jedi.

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,020
Tup? What's the matter with you?

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,690
Uh, no... Nothing. I'm fine.

42
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,860
Come on, brother.
Don't want to be left behind.

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,320
Increase our defenses.
We must hold them here.

44
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,630
Don't fall back! Push forward!

45
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,130
Tup! Hey!
This is not the time to freeze up!

46
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,430
Pull it together! We're almost
to the finish line! Come on!

47
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,230
Jedi...

48
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
Good soldiers follow orders.

49
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,700
Hey, Tup!

50
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,530
On your right!

51
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
Tup! No!

52
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,330
Sister!

53
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,010
Hold your position!

54
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,930
Destroyers!

55
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,730
We've lost our momentum! Fall back!

56
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,450
Fives, I don't know what's going on,

57
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,070
but you are responsible for Tup now.
Get him back to base. I want answers.

58
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,350
The Jedi
have withdrawn their forces.

59
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,070
Contact Count Dooku immediately.

60
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,820
I have something
he'll be very interested in.

61
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:59,660
Count Dooku,
the Republic forces are in full retreat.

62
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,790
But this is not why
you have contacted me, is it?

63
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:10,220
No, Count, in truth the Republic had
pushed my droids to the breaking point,

64
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,220
when they suddenly turned
and fell back.

65
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,940
It seemed that
at the height of the conflict,

66
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,770
a clone turned on his Jedi General

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,810
and executed her.

68
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,980
Intentionally?

69
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,940
I saw it with my own eyes.

70
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,910
I have studied clones and fought
against them in many battles.

71
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:39,830
This action is unlike anything I have
witnessed in their behavior as soldiers.

72
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,760
So, there is a traitor in their midst.

73
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,850
It's rare, but such things
have been reported in the past.

74
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,180
Not a traitor, this was different.
It seemed...

75
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,800
Yes, Admiral?

76
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,890
It seemed as if the clone
could not help himself,

77
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:02,020
as if he was entranced.

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,310
Thank you, Admiral.
I will take this under advisement.

79
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,670
Why? Why would he do this?

80
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,210
I'm about to find out.

81
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,180
How's he doing, Rex?

82
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm not sure, General.
It seems like he just snapped.

83
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,900
Tup, can you hear me?

84
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,690
- Yes, Captain.
- What happened?

85
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,060
What do you mean?

86
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,820
Do you have any idea
what you've done?

87
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,610
Good soldiers follow orders.

88
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,250
Good soldiers follow orders.

89
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,030
Good soldiers follow orders.
Good soldiers follow orders.

90
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
What is he talking about?

91
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,670
I have no idea.

92
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,350
Kill the Jedi.

93
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,416
We have to get him back
to the medical bay

94
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,780
before he hurts anyone else.

95
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:45,210
My Lord, I have received a
report that leads me to conclude

96
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,460
we may have encountered
a grave complication

97
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,300
with one of our assets.

98
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,670
Assets?

99
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,730
Yes, sir. A clone trooper has
executed one of the Jedi Generals.

100
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,890
And you believe this is indicative
of our programming?

101
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,140
I do, My Lord. But I cannot be certain.

102
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,650
It is pertinent we ascertain
if this is an isolated event,

103
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,900
a failure in this particular
clone's programming.

104
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,490
Otherwise my plans may be ruined.

105
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,820
Seize the clone immediately.

106
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,990
Yes, My Master.

107
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,630
Fives, what's happening to me?

108
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,340
You don't remember?

109
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:41,260
No.

110
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,680
You murdered General Tiplar.

111
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,610
What? No, that's not possible.

112
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:52,190
I would never... I could never...

113
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,690
Tup, you did.

114
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,410
I don't... I don't understand.
How could this happen?

115
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,240
What's happening to me, Fives?

116
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,610
Ahh!

117
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,200
No! No! No...

118
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,460
What do you think happened?

119
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,290
Did you check all of his scans?

120
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,300
Well, all of his scans are clear.

121
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,300
As far as I can tell,
this is a combat-related stress.

122
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,890
It's seems he's had
some sort of breakdown.

123
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,970
Kix, you should know better.

124
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,640
We were designed
to withstand any stress.

125
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,350
I agree.
We've been through a lot together.

126
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,350
He doesn't seem
to remember what happened.

127
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,900
It's like he's sick, or drugged.

128
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,610
Well, it could be a virus, a toxin.

129
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,570
I can't be certain.

130
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,740
Let's talk outside.

131
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,380
You mean the enemy could have
made him do this?

132
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,670
It's a possibility.

133
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,500
There have been rumors
that Separatists have been trying

134
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,710
to develop an anti-clone virus.
Biological warfare.

135
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,130
Listen, we aren't equipped
for this type of situation.

136
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,310
He'll have to be taken back to Kamino.
Only then will you have your answer.

137
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,770
Wait! Wait!

138
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
Tup, it's gonna be fine. I promise.

139
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,110
They'll fix you up real good.

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,370
We'll be having
a drink together in no time, eh?

141
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,410
Good soldiers follow orders.

142
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,780
Good soldiers follow orders.

143
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,660
You are a good soldier, Tup.

144
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,540
It's time to go now.

145
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:34,120
Be careful.

146
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,880
Yes, General.

147
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,250
We are tracking clean, calculating
hyperspace jump in five, four...

148
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,896
- Oh, wait! Wait!

149
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,340
Scanners indicate incoming craft.
Abort jump!

150
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,630
Mayday! Mayday!
The enemy cut us off!

151
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,550
They must have
circled around behind us.

152
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,050
We're being overwhelmed. Ahh!

153
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,290
Can't let 'em in here!
Hold that line.

154
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,750
Here they come.

155
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,670
Blast them!

156
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,690
General Skywalker,

157
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:46,570
you are nearing the coordinates
where we lost contact with the shuttle.

158
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:50,240
We can see it now.
It doesn't look good.

159
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,000
Looks like some buzz droids
got on the hull and opened her right up.

160
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,040
Hmm, strategically, this attack
doesn't make any sense.

161
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:08,170
Unless they were
after something specific.

162
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
- Tup...
- I'm going over there.

163
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,760
We're coming with you.

164
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,580
Over here.
This is Tup's gurney.

165
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,920
The restraints have been cut.

166
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,670
The clankers took Tup? Why?

167
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,050
They must be responsible
for whatever's happening to him.

168
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,260
It's possible.

169
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,980
All I know is they went to great lengths
to capture him.

170
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,310
And that means something.

171
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,220
We have got to get him back.

172
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,310
Don't worry.
We'll find a way.

173
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,490
We have captured
the clone, Count.

174
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,400
- Good work, Admiral.

175
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,360
Send him to me immediately,

176
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,870
and under all circumstances,
keep him alive!

177
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,160
Yes, sir.

178
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,370
Get him on the next shuttle out of here.

179
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,840
But the Republic blockade...

180
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,500
See to it personally, Commander.

181
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,520
It will be just the three of us going in.

182
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,920
The shuttle will drop us off
just short of the main hanger,

183
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,690
then we spacewalk from there.

184
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,586
Are you picking anything up
on Tup's locator?

185
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,900
I've got a faint signal,
but it's hard to track. It's moving.

186
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,910
Then we better hurry.

187
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,280
I've got a better signal.
Tup is heading this way.

188
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,950
They're moving him
to the hangar.

189
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:14,940
Are your scopes Jedi-issue, sir?

190
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:18,280
- Stay focused, Fives.

191
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,740
There he is, sir.
We'll have to work fast.

192
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,120
There must be a hundred
droids in that hangar,

193
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,790
not to mention the starfighters.

194
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:32,210
This is stretching it, even for you, sir!

195
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:34,420
Rex, you're beginning
to sound like Obi-Wan.

196
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,130
You got a better idea?

197
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,760
Look, I don't doubt
you could pull it off,

198
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,390
but I'm just not sure Fives and I
would be around to see it happen.

199
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,930
- I've got an idea.
- Well, let's hear it, quickly!

200
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,560
Grappling gun. Good thinking.

201
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,270
Get ready to hold on.

202
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,690
That's why he's the ARC Trooper.

203
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:21,090
Is there a problem?

204
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,760
We were experiencing some
drag but the sensors are stabilized now.

205
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:29,560
You were experiencing drag
in the vacuum of space?

206
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,890
Yeah, strange.
But it is gone now.

207
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,370
Scrap them!

208
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,020
Hey, now we're
experiencing turbulence.

209
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,900
What's going on?
What do you know about this clone?

210
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,900
I am programmed to resist intimidation.

211
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,650
Fine.

212
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,160
How's he doing?

213
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:33,830
Not well. Not well at all.

214
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,930
I think he's dying, sir.

215
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,420
We have to get him to Kamino.

216
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,770
I'll want a full report
from Kamino.

217
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,230
If Tup is the victim
of some Separatist plot,

218
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,200
we have no idea
of how widespread it already is.

219
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,740
Permission to
come with you, sir.

220
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,040
He's my best friend.
You may need help.

221
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,790
But everything must
be done by the book.

222
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,040
Understood, sir.

223
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,210
You're to stay by his side at all times.
I don't want any more slip-ups.

224
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,880
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Let's go.

225
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,820
Medical frigate 517,
you are cleared for departure.

226
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,400
Good luck, boys.
