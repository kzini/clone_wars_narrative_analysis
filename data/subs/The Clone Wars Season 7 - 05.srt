1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,183
<i>Betrayal.</i>

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,062
<i>Jedi Padawan Ahsoka Tano</i>
<i>was wrongly accused of treason</i>

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,439
<i>by the Jedi Council</i>

4
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:25,316
<i>and hunted</i>
<i>by the Grand Army of the Republic.</i>

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,901
<i>Believing his apprentice was innocent,</i>

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>Anakin Skywalker</i>
<i>discovered the true villain</i>

7
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,073
<i>was Ahsoka's close friend, Barriss Offee.</i>

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>Unable to reconcile her relationship</i>
<i>with the Jedi Order,</i>

9
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,415
<i>Ahsoka decided to walk away</i>
<i>from the only life she had ever known.</i>

10
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,023
What?

11
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:07,233
No, no, no.

12
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,401
Whoa!

13
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,701
-Hey!
-Sorry!

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,581
Watch out!

15
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,808
All right.

16
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,851
Oh, no.

17
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,062
Whoa!

18
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,480
Come on!

19
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,360
Come on!

20
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,820
What a piece of junk.

21
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,239
Now, how am I gonna fix this?

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,704
Oh! Bad crash. Nice roll, though.

23
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,206
Thanks... I guess.

24
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,376
That bike is trash.

25
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,921
I don't know what I was thinking
when I bought it.

26
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:57,761
Look at this mess.
The repulsor blew. The compressor is shot.

27
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,388
Sounds like you know
a thing or two about engines.

28
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,683
I'm sorry. Who are you?

29
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,143
I'm Trace.

30
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,482
Ahsoka.

31
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,984
As for your bike, you're in luck.

32
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,863
You happened to crash onto
one of the best repair shops on 1313.

33
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,199
So you're a mechanic?

34
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:23,661
That I am, and I'd be glad
to fix your bike for a price.

35
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,332
I can fix my own bike.
I just need some tools.

36
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:31,086
Have it your way.
But the tools are still gonna cost you.

37
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,340
I don't have much in the way of credits.

38
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,010
Don't worry. Down here, no one does.
Come on.

39
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,648
That's a <i>Nebula</i>-class freighter.
Or at least it was.

40
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,525
Good eye.

41
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:57,153
I'm turning it into something
with a bit more speed. I think.

42
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,489
Your space is over there.

43
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,950
Why don't you get that thing inside
and settle in?

44
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,910
Thanks.

45
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,538
Don't take too long. Time is money.

46
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,751
Hey, why are you helping me?

47
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,673
Shouldn't I?
Seemed like the right thing to do.

48
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,300
You can leave if you want.

49
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,761
No. It's all right.

50
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,179
I'll stay.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,264
Thank you.

52
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,975
That's good. I really need the money.

53
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,952
How's it going down there? Need any help?

54
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,954
Not if you're gonna charge me.

55
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,959
Hey, I don't know where you're from,
but down here, everything has a price.

56
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,628
If you're gonna stick around,
you better get used to it.

57
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,798
Well, you might be in luck.

58
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,761
This engine isn't going to run
without a new sparker.

59
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,970
Got one I can buy?

60
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,391
Got bad news.
The only sparkers I got are right here.

61
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,477
And I ain't got no more.

62
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,397
That won't do. I need to get out of here.

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,984
Why? You running from something?

64
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,865
Maybe this was a bad idea.
I don't know what I'm doing here.

65
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,911
Hey! What did I say?

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,498
Look, you can stay here
as long as you like.

67
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,918
If you can pay me. What's with you?

68
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,855
No sense in keeping you here
if you're gonna be miserable.

69
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,940
I appreciate the help.

70
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,151
What's it gonna cost?

71
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,069
It's on the house.

72
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,908
You know, where I come from,
it's very different from here.

73
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,705
Obviously.
So where do you come from anyway?

74
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,707
I...

75
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,167
um...

76
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,962
used to live in
the upper levels of Coruscant.

77
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,342
Ah, up there where the air is clear, huh?

78
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,344
You're probably better off down here.

79
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,179
Why's that?

80
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,639
I'm sure you have your problems up there

81
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:16,353
with the Jedi running around
starting wars, policing everything.

82
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,231
The Jedi didn't start the war.
They're trying to stop it.

83
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,942
Sure. Sure, they are.

84
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,695
Look, it doesn't really matter anyway.

85
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,947
They've forgotten all about us.

86
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,949
What do you mean?

87
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,912
It's just... when you're a kid,
you hear stories.

88
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,456
I guess they're not
what I thought they'd be.

89
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:41,419
It's not safe down here
or anywhere on Coruscant.

90
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:45,924
That's why I've got my ship,
so I can make my living in the stars.

91
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,134
Just me and my sister Rafa.

92
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,722
We'll get away from the Jedi,
this war, all of it.

93
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,559
Martez, your sister said
she was paying me today.

94
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,061
Where is she?

95
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,065
Let me handle this.
Don't do anything. Got it?

96
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:03,983
All right.

97
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:08,363
Hey, hey, Pintu.
Rafa said she was coming to see you.

98
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,616
Well, since she's not here,

99
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,202
I guess you're gonna have
to pay me instead.

100
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,122
I'd back off if I were you.

101
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,332
-Stay out of this.
-Stay out of this.

102
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,294
Now, where's my money?

103
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,383
I got it. Right... here!

104
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,744
On second thought,
some help would be great.

105
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,256
Huh?

106
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,730
I think you wanna leave now.

107
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,361
Tell Rafa this is far from over.

108
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:36,785
Whoa!
Where did you learn to fight like that?

109
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,578
My older brother taught me.

110
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,413
Maybe you can teach me someday.

111
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,750
Come on, we gotta go
tell my sister about Pintu.

112
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:53,677
Uh...

113
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,015
Nope.

114
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,354
-Meh.
-Rafa.

115
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,986
Rafa, does that belong to you?

116
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,072
Not yet.

117
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:19,077
Oh, Trace! What happened to your face?

118
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,497
Pintu came by to get paid.
You weren't there.

119
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,040
You plan on paying him?

120
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,709
I am.

121
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,878
I got a big job coming through
that'll make everything good for us.

122
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:32,424
Is it legitimate this time
or the usual job?

123
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:33,883
Hey, what did I teach you?

124
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,011
We can't count on anyone--

125
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,638
So we count on ourselves. I know.

126
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,308
That's right. That's how we survive.

127
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,896
Who is this interesting creature?

128
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,399
My name is Ahsoka.

129
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:51,776
Lovely name, Ahsoka.

130
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,988
Ahsoka, this is my sister, Rafa Martez.

131
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,574
How'd you end up with this moof-milker?

132
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,577
She fell from the sky. I mean, really.

133
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,954
Dropped right in on the mech bay platform.

134
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,665
Where exactly are you from?

135
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,961
I'm from Topside.
Your sister's been helping me out.

136
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,882
Really?
How much is she charging you?

137
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,967
Not enough to pay your debt.

138
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:20,638
Not that it's any of your business,
but I am sorry about that, Trace.

139
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:24,225
You promised
you would stay away from Pintu.

140
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,438
I needed money for this place,
for repairs and other things.

141
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,274
You could have at least
given me a heads-up

142
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,984
that you weren't gonna pay him.

143
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,446
You're right. Won't happen again.

144
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,367
Good. I can only take
so many punches to my head

145
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,993
and still be considered a pilot.

146
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,915
Here's our next payday.

147
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,376
How can I help you, my friend?

148
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,545
I've got three droids
that need to be built.

149
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,216
My business partner
brokered a deal with a...

150
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:58,551
a Rafa Martez.

151
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,720
You're looking at her.

152
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,639
And that deal will be honored.

153
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:06,893
This may not look like a droid factory,
but that's to throw off the authorities.

154
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,604
My associate does assembly in the back.

155
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,606
Who's your associate?

156
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,316
Don't worry about that yet.

157
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,820
My, uh, business partner,

158
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:20,615
he said you build droids
better than anybody.

159
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:25,036
Then they know quality.
Look, just bring them 'round back.

160
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,421
So, Trace, feel like building some droids?

161
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:46,057
It's been a while since I built a droid.

162
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:49,060
But it's not too difficult,
just more moving parts.

163
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,355
Just make sure
you affix the restraining bolt

164
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,442
to that pile of moving parts
before you punch the power cycle.

165
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,152
Got one right here.

166
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,195
What's your worry?

167
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,782
I've had my fair share
of run-ins with droids.

168
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:04,492
The majority are fine,

169
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,828
but some are just cross-wired
from the start.

170
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,622
And this is no astromech.

171
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:19,007
You seem to know a lot about everything.

172
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,508
Not everything.

173
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,802
I still don't understand people.

174
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:23,887
What's to know?

175
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,389
There are good people and bad people,

176
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,185
and some are just cross-wired
like this binary load lifter.

177
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:33,730
Binary load lifter.

178
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,068
Wait a minute.
I do know this type of droid.

179
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,124
Are you all right?

180
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,294
Type two load lifters were a fraud.

181
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:59,756
They were repurposed demolition droids
prone to violence.

182
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,341
Naturally.

183
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,052
Well, good thing
we put the restraining bolts on.

184
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,554
Trace, the bolt.

185
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,449
What the...

186
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,955
No. That-- That's not...

187
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,541
No, no. No, no.

188
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,544
Trace, that's my droid. Where's it going?

189
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:40,463
It's a test run. Nothing to worry about.

190
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,424
This isn't funny, Trace!

191
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,484
Stop!

192
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,611
Stop!

193
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,538
You said demolition droid, right?

194
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:15,290
Yeah.

195
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:26,634
Go back to Rafa's and get
the tracking device for that droid.

196
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:27,844
What are you gonna do?

197
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,596
Find a speeder and meet you there.

198
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:35,769
Where's the droid?

199
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,479
Working on it.

200
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,522
Where's Trace?

201
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,649
Gotta go.

202
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,860
Trace, I trusted you.

203
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,946
We're going to owe more credits
than we were paid for this thing!

204
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,950
Stop. Stop. It's really close.

205
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:52,410
Where? Do you see it?

206
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,454
Yeah. It's headed straight for us.

207
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,964
Hey!

208
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,848
The off switch, it's on its face plate.

209
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,101
Okay. But let me grab it first.

210
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:38,456
Got it!

211
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,211
See? Nothing to it.

212
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:47,757
Oh, no. This was a bad idea.

213
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,342
Yeah, that happens.

214
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,802
I gotta cut it loose.

215
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,558
-We can't let it get away.
-Take the controls!

216
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,979
Just hit the blue button!

217
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,454
Come on. Come on!

218
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:31,968
Hey, kid.

219
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,433
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Ah!

220
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,247
-Come on, you got it.
-There you go, all good!

221
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,378
Bad. Bad.

222
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,303
Look there. Look, they have it.

223
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,147
Trace?

224
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:33,113
See? Nothing to worry about.

225
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:34,989
We had it all under control.

226
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:43,373
I am not going to dismantle those droids.
A deal is a deal.

227
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,916
They could hurt someone.

228
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:47,836
Honestly, not my problem.

229
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,213
You don't know
what those droids could be used for.

230
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:53,216
They're dangerous.
One tore apart the sector.

231
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,427
Without a restraining bolt.

232
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,512
Trace, did you put the bolt on all three?

233
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,265
Yeah, but what if one comes off?

234
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,268
Why is this a discussion? We all know--

235
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,020
That you're new here.

236
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,694
Trace, I'll do the right thing.

237
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:15,321
I'll meet you at the wharf, okay?

238
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,490
Rafa, just be smart.

239
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,701
Come on, Ahsoka.

240
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,545
Wahoo!

241
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,560
Do you ever get a say with Rafa?

242
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,313
She's my older sister.

243
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,023
She doesn't always get it right,

244
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,443
but I know she's trying
to make things better for us.

245
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,071
At what cost?

246
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,455
Did you tell that guy about the droids?

247
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:09,250
Actually, I charged the Twi'lek double.

248
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:10,960
You gave them back.

249
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,464
You said be smart.
Look, they weren't mine to keep.

250
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,384
We don't build them, somebody else would.

251
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,551
I don't give them back,

252
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:20,762
that's more trouble
for the Martez sisters.

253
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,389
Rafa.

254
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,767
I used the credits to pay off Pintu.

255
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,103
If I didn't get the credits
for those droids,

256
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,979
they were gonna keep coming after us.

257
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,818
Here's enough to buy new tools.
That makes it worth it, right?

258
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,154
I guess so.

259
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:39,906
Stick with me, Trace.

260
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,536
One day, we'll have enough credits,
Pintu will be coming to us for work.

261
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,961
I'd better go finish my speeder.

262
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,879
You're not sticking around?

263
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:57,674
I think it's for the best.

264
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,637
Hey.

265
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:07,892
Thanks for saving me out there.

266
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:10,353
You're welcome.

267
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,024
Now, let's get that speeder working.
Come on.
