1
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:20,080
Pantora in peril!

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,410
The newly elected Chairman of Pantora,
Baron Papanoida,

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,960
is caught in a deadly political game.

4
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,640
The Trade Federation
has blockaded Pantora

5
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,460
and suspended all commerce
with the system.

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,300
Isolated from the rest of the Republic,

7
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,630
the people of Pantora are beginning
to rally against the Senate,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,300
who have seemed unsympathetic
to their plight.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,310
To make matters worse, Count Dooku
has come forward, offering aid

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,390
if Pantora joins the Separatist alliance.

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,810
Chairman Papanoida has dispatched
Senator Chuchi to Coruscant

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,440
with the hope that she can motivate
the Senate to act in favor of Pantora

13
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,650
before Lott Dod can legitimize
the blockade.

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,160
The Trade Federation is neutral in this,

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,950
but Pantora must pay its debt

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,510
before we can resume commerce
with the system.

17
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,870
That is a lie.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,380
It is well known that the Trade Federation
is aligned with the Separatists.

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,760
Slanderous!

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,760
We are not Separatists simply
because we do business with them.

21
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:22,680
How many times must I remind you
of the Commerce Treaty of 1647?

22
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,850
The Trade Federation is neutral.

23
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,520
I beg the Senate to listen to our pleas.

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,770
Ignore the Trade Federation's
feeble attempt

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,860
to paint this as a domestic financial issue

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,400
and allow us to resume trade.

27
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,290
Wait! Senator Chuchi.

28
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,380
I wanted to compliment you
on your speech.

29
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,880
- Thank you, Padmé.
- You are very brave.

30
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,220
The Trade Federation doesn't frighten me.

31
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,300
I just wanted to let you know
that there are many of us in the Senate

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,180
that support you and Pantora
in these difficult times.

33
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,020
I know the Separatists have
approached you to offer their help.

34
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,850
Please do not take it.

35
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,020
The Senate will force the Trade Federation
to resume trade.

36
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,770
Don't worry, Senator.

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,030
There's no way that Pantora will ever
have dealings with the Separatists.

38
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,280
We'll always be loyal to the Republic.

39
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,030
The Chairman of Pantora has just arrived.
I must go brief him.

40
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,410
Please, send him my best wishes.

41
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,460
- Chairman Papanoida.
- Senator Chuchi.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,330
You spoke well
on behalf of our people today.

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,880
I only hope the Senate is truly listening.

44
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,250
As do I, Chairman.

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,880
Allow me to introduce my family.

46
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,260
These are my daughters, Chi Eekway
and Che Amanwe, and my son, Ion.

47
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,220
Father, Amanwe and I are going home.
Don't be too late.

48
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,560
I won't be long. Ion and I have some issues
to discuss with the Senator first.

49
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,820
Things are deteriorating rapidly, Senator.

50
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,750
Ion has just brought word from Pantora

51
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,570
that things are far worse
than we've been led to believe.

52
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,200
The people are restless.

53
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,120
The Trade Federation blockade is causing
far more damage and disorder

54
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,580
- than we predicted.
- We need more time.

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,750
The Senate will vote in our favor,
I'm sure of it.

56
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,580
Count Dooku and the Separatists
are promising immediate aid

57
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,790
and a resolution to the blockade.

58
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,170
You're not suggesting we join them,
are you?

59
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,710
Certainly not.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,090
I merely point out that the wheels
of democracy are moving too slowly.

61
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,760
There are Pantorans rallying
for us to leave the Republic

62
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,350
and join the Separatists.

63
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,810
We cannot give up
on the Republic Senate!

64
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,770
Chairman, you must convince the people
to remain loyal to our cause.

65
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,230
I will do what I can, Senator.

66
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,210
What's wrong with the lights?

67
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,410
Did you see that?

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,790
It's nothing,
just the shadows playing tricks.

69
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,300
Don't tell me you are afraid of the dark?

70
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,220
Chi?

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,440
Chi? Stop fooling around.

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:18,940
My father's a powerful man. If you
hurt me or my sister, you'll be dead!

73
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:26,410
Big talk. You're coming with us!

74
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,960
Hurry! Let's go!

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
I don't like the situation on Pantora
one bit.

76
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:53,060
It reminds me far too much
of Naboo's own scarred history.

77
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,770
Well, that blockade wasn't that bad.

78
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,150
It's the reason I met you, after all.

79
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,030
You certainly have a unique way
of looking at things, Ani.

80
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,940
Senator Amidala! Master Skywalker!

81
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,190
What is it, Ahsoka?

82
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,240
Someone has kidnapped
Chairman Papanoida's daughters.

83
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,780
I was afraid something like this
would happen. Anakin?

84
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,870
The Jedi can't get involved.
This is a job for the local police.

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,620
I'm not so sure
local authorities can handle it.

86
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,000
The Separatists are putting a lot
of pressure on Pantora to join them.

87
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,420
I'm afraid this blockade may give
the Pantorans no other choice.

88
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:31,600
Master, if the Jedi can't officially
get involved, let me do this on my own.

89
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Senator Chuchi is a good friend of mine.

90
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,810
All right. With the Separatists involved,
I guess it gives you cause to investigate.

91
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,480
Go help Senator Chuchi, but don't get
in the way of the local authorities.

92
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:43,980
Aren't you going to help?

93
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,320
I said the situation gives "you"
cause to investigate, not "us."

94
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,756
I need to go back to the Jedi Temple

95
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,200
and make sure the Council doesn't find out
about your little expedition.

96
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,800
Should you really proceed
without the Council's approval?

97
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,250
- We do it all the time, don't we, Snips?
- Yep.

98
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,960
Well, be careful, Ahsoka.

99
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,630
I still can't believe they let you teach.

100
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,960
Give your father my condolences.

101
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,680
If you want your sisters back,
we're here to help.

102
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,230
Father, Count Dooku has offered to help us
find Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe.

103
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,770
Chuchi, Senator Amidala sent me to help,
if I can.

104
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,440
Chairman Papanoida.

105
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,320
This is my good friend Ahsoka.

106
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,320
Good. A Jedi can always be of help.

107
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,160
Senator Amidala thinks this may have
something to do with the Separatists.

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,790
They've already made contact with us.
I don't think this is a kidnapping.

109
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,500
I think they're holding them hostage.

110
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,040
A not very subtle attempt
to get us to join the Separatists?

111
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,880
If the Separatists are involved,
your daughters may be held

112
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,670
on the Trade Federation ship
blockading your planet.

113
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,220
That is a possibility.

114
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,510
Why don't you and Chuchi
pay them a diplomatic visit

115
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,430
and see what you can find out?

116
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,180
We'll stay here
and follow the police investigation.

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,360
Did you find anything?

118
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,400
We've completed a thorough sweep
of your apartment, Chairman.

119
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,860
No evidence of foul play.

120
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,700
My daughters' lives are in your hands,
Inspector.

121
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,200
You have nothing to worry about,
Your Honor.

122
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,250
We are in complete control
of the situation.

123
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
That inspector is useless!
They must have left clues somewhere.

124
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,880
Look here. The icon of the moon goddess.

125
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:37,390
It should be up on the shrine
with the others.

126
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,560
Wait a minute! What's this?

127
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,270
Blood?

128
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,900
It must be what they used
to fight off their attackers.

129
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,400
But the kidnappers didn't know
to put it back in the right place.

130
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,710
Information Retrieval,
I need you to match this blood sample

131
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,590
against known galactic criminals.

132
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,880
A Rodian.

133
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,210
Says here his name's Greedo.

134
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,420
Looks like he's based on Tatooine.

135
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:14,300
Then what are we waiting for?

136
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,460
Senator Chuchi.
To what do we owe this pleasure?

137
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,590
I bring word from the Chairman of Pantora.

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,300
The Chairman has finally decided
to agree to our terms?

139
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,760
Not exactly.

140
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,260
The Chairman wanted to inform you
of an impending alliance

141
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,930
between Pantora and
the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

142
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,980
The Chairman is planning
to join the Separatist alliance?

143
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:09,190
If that were the case, would you remove
your blockade of Pantora?

144
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,900
If that were the case,

145
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,780
the Chairman would have to go
to the Senate and renounce the Republic.

146
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,200
Then we could discuss
how quickly we can resume commerce.

147
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,460
Very well. I shall contact the Chairman.

148
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,450
We can discuss the finer details
of the terms later this evening.

149
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,950
Agreed.

150
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
Now you and your servant
may stay as our honored guests.

151
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,590
Come this way to your rooms.

152
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,110
Be careful, Ion.

153
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,450
The Hutts are the only law
that matters on Tatooine.

154
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,280
I don't scare easily.

155
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,650
- Where do we start?
- We'll have to get a feel for the crowd.

156
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,570
Shouldn't we talk to Jabba directly?

157
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,910
No. Remember, we're not sure
who's behind this kidnapping yet.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,670
- Jabba could be involved.
- What if Greedo runs?

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,130
We'll let Greedo know we're here.
That way, he'll come to us.

160
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,800
- How are we going to do that?
- Follow me.

161
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:07,640
Ladies! Do any of you know Greedo?

162
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,280
Who's asking?

163
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,360
We're asking.
We're looking to hire a bounty hunter.

164
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,320
He's not here.

165
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,780
But if he comes back,
I'll tell him you were asking for him.

166
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,320
Patience.

167
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,660
If she won't lead us to Greedo,
she'll lead Greedo to us.

168
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,970
This is the ambassador's office.
Maybe we'll find something here.

169
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,810
The Separatists are still recovering
from their defeat

170
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,690
- on Orto Plutonia.
- They're coming! Hide!

171
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:01,740
We need to know who our supporters are.

172
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:06,320
I understand your profit margins
with the Separatists can be considerable.

173
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,200
However, I object to the kidnapping.

174
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,540
The Chairman's children are leverage.
Besides, they're well taken care of.

175
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,670
Yes, but why on my ship?

176
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,170
What was that?

177
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,670
Are you certain we're alone?

178
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,030
I'm sure I heard something.

179
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,700
All of this scheming with the Separatists
is making you paranoid.

180
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:57,420
Do not worry,
the daughters are not to be harmed,

181
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,250
at least for now.

182
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,890
You see? The Trade Federation
is behind the kidnapping.

183
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,100
Let's find the detention area. Come on.

184
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,150
Ha!

185
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,570
Poodoo!

186
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,950
Greedo, baby, there you are.

187
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,830
There's some men here looking for you.

188
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,460
Pantorans.

189
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,790
They must have found some evidence.

190
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,750
We'll have to settle things
more permanently.

191
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:55,100
- Have you done this before?
- No. But I've been practicing.

192
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,690
The detention block is closed to visitors.
Move along.

193
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,980
You will let me pass.

194
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,820
I will let you pass.

195
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,450
I'm sorry, the detention block
is closed to visitors.

196
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,700
Ahsoka?

197
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,470
You will let us both pass.

198
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:28,460
I... I will let you both pass.

199
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Looking for someone, Chairman?

200
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,150
I was looking for you, Greedo.

201
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,160
Tell me where my daughters are, or die.

202
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:51,490
You were a fool to come here.

203
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:54,370
Let's dispose of them outside.

204
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,080
- I don't want to die on this dust ball.
- We won't have to.

205
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,100
We're going to talk to Jabba about this.

206
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:20,220
This is the fifth area we've checked,

207
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,520
and there's no sign
of the Chairman's daughters.

208
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:26,020
Can't you sense where they are?
Isn't that something you Jedi can do?

209
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,440
It's not something
I can just turn on or off.

210
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:30,570
We'll just have to keep looking.

211
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Sir, we have intruders
in the detention area.

212
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,710
It looks like our guests got
a little too curious for their own good.

213
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,630
Chairman Papanoida,
the mighty Jabba wishes to know

214
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,270
why you tried to kill
one of his bounty hunters.

215
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,270
Great Jabba,
my daughters have been kidnapped.

216
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,970
As a father yourself,
I know you understand

217
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,270
that I will do anything
to get them back safely.

218
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,770
I have evidence that Greedo is responsible,

219
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,770
which means that either you are behind it

220
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,320
or Greedo is working for someone else.

221
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,530
Since we are friends, Jabba,
I know you would never do such a thing.

222
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,290
No! No! He's lying!

223
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,750
We found blood at the scene of the crime.

224
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,170
If it matches Greedo's,
it will prove he is the kidnapper.

225
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,050
Jabba will allow a blood sample
to be taken.

226
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,840
Wait. Wait, no! It's all lies!

227
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,520
Okay, okay! I kidnapped them!

228
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,270
The Separatists wanted leverage
against you.

229
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,730
Where are they, you slime?

230
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,320
One of them is here, at Mos Eisley.
She's safe, I assure you.

231
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,150
Take us there!

232
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,240
Let's hope she's in this one.

233
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,670
Senator Chuchi? How did you find me?

234
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,720
It's a long story. Where's your sister?

235
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,020
I don't know. We were separated.

236
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,990
All right, sleemo, no tricks!
We're gonna go inside and find my sister.

237
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,780
Nice and easy.

238
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,580
You think they will just
hand her over to you?

239
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,120
No,
but I'll bet they'll hand her over to you.

240
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,720
Go get the prisoner.

241
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,890
Greedo, what are you doing here?

242
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:13,440
There's been a change of plans.
We're going to have to move the prisoner.

243
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,230
On whose orders?

244
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,910
Gunray.
He contacted me at Jabba's palace.

245
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,950
Why'd he contact you?
And who are those two?

246
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,620
They're emissaries
of the Trade Federation.

247
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,680
Trade Federation? They don't look
like Trade Federation to me.

248
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,760
- Father!
- Father?

249
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,380
They're Pantorans! Blast them!

250
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Stop them!

251
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:44,410
Surrender, Separatist!

252
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,460
What is the meaning of this?

253
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,050
You've been holding the Chairman
of Pantora's daughter as a hostage!

254
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,880
What?
Sib Canay, what is she talking about?

255
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,430
I want my litigator.

256
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,760
We are businessmen!
We deal in trade and commerce!

257
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,430
Yes, but perhaps your business
is war profiteering.

258
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,480
- How dare you!
- I dare

259
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,270
because you claim
to have no involvement,

260
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,440
and yet here stands the Chairman's
daughter on your ship,

261
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,150
held by your administrator.

262
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,990
I may understand your position,

263
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,530
but I doubt the rest of the Senate will.

264
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,820
- Blackmail!
- No,

265
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:30,120
business.

266
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,540
I could, of course, be persuaded

267
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,830
to defend your unfortunate circumstances
to the Senate.

268
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,000
That is, if this blockade ended.

269
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,670
I'll see what I can do.

270
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:51,720
It has come to our attention
that the ugly head of the Separatist

271
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,690
has once again raised itself in the ranks
of our very own Trade Federation.

272
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,030
Nute Gunray's influence extends farther
than we ever imagined.

273
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,360
It was Sib Canay,
acting on his own accord,

274
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:10,570
who kidnapped the children
of Chairman Papanoida.

275
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,370
In good faith,
we have returned them to him.

276
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,000
And also, as a gesture of friendship,

277
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:23,500
we are removing our blockade
and reopening trade with the Pantorans.
