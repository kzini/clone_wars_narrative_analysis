1
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,123
Diplomacy or deception?

2
00:00:20,244 --> 00:00:23,644
The Council of Neutral Systems
speaks for over 1,500 worlds

3
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:25,646
who want to stay out of the war.

4
00:00:25,727 --> 00:00:27,886
But rumors have reached
the Republic Senate

5
00:00:27,968 --> 00:00:31,648
suggesting that the Council's new leader,
Duchess Satine of Mandalore,

6
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:36,091
is secretly building her own army
to fight for the Separatist cause.

7
00:00:36,172 --> 00:00:39,772
Now Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi
has been sent to Mandalore

8
00:00:39,853 --> 00:00:42,694
to discover the truth behind these claims.

9
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,260
The Duchess awaits you, General Kenobi.

10
00:00:58,502 --> 00:01:01,463
Far be it for me
to keep the Duchess waiting.

11
00:01:21,992 --> 00:01:23,553
General Kenobi.

12
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:26,473
Thank you for meeting with me,
Prime Minister Almec.

13
00:01:26,595 --> 00:01:28,595
I welcome you as a servant of the people.

14
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:32,116
But I am troubled by the false rumors
that brought you here.

15
00:01:32,198 --> 00:01:34,758
Mandalore would never turn
against the Republic.

16
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,319
The Duchess Satine values peace
more than her own life.

17
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,200
Oh, I'm aware of the Duchess's views.

18
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:43,801
Master Kenobi,
Mandalore's violent past is behind us.

19
00:01:43,883 --> 00:01:47,523
All of our warriors were exiled
to our moon, Concordia.

20
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,524
They died out years ago.

21
00:01:49,965 --> 00:01:52,126
Hmm. Are you certain?

22
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:56,687
I recently encountered a man
who wore Mandalorian armor. Jango Fett.

23
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:01,409
Jango Fett was a common bounty hunter.
How he acquired that armor is beyond me.

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,811
Well, Master Kenobi.

25
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:07,052
My shining Jedi Knight
to the rescue once again.

26
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:16,776
After all these years,
you're even more beautiful than ever.

27
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:19,738
Kind words from a man
who accuses me of treachery.

28
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,860
I would never accuse you
of personal wrongdoing, Duchess.

29
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,662
However, a Separatist saboteur
attacked one of our Republic cruisers.

30
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,623
A Mandalorian saboteur.

31
00:02:38,427 --> 00:02:39,907
You must be mistaken.

32
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,549
No Mandalorian would engage
in such violence, not anymore.

33
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,350
Where is this prisoner now?

34
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:48,351
He took his own life
rather than submit to questioning.

35
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:52,474
I know these commandos fought
in many wars, often against the Jedi.

36
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,755
Every one of my people
is as trustworthy as I am.

37
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:59,676
- I know we sound defensive, but...
- Clearly, your investigation was ordered

38
00:02:59,758 --> 00:03:02,957
because the Senate is eager
to intervene in our affairs.

39
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,480
My investigation was ordered
by the Jedi Council.

40
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,961
I stand corrected.

41
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:13,483
General Kenobi, perhaps you'd like
to join me on a walk through the city.

44
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,295
Your peaceful ways have paid off.

45
00:03:41,376 --> 00:03:44,017
Mandalore has prospered
since the last time I was here.

46
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,818
Not everyone on Mandalore believes
that our commitment to peace

47
00:03:46,899 --> 00:03:49,059
is a sign of progress.

48
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,661
There is a group
that calls itself Death Watch.

49
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,782
I imagine these are the renegades
you're looking for.

50
00:03:55,864 --> 00:03:59,743
They idolize violence
and the warrior ways of the past.

51
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:01,625
There are those among us,
certain officials,

52
00:04:01,706 --> 00:04:04,467
who are working
to root out these criminals.

53
00:04:04,546 --> 00:04:06,667
It has been an ongoing investigation.

54
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,588
How widespread is
this Death Watch movement?

55
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,230
It's hardly a movement.
It's a small group of hooligans

56
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,552
who choose to vandalize public places,
nothing more.

57
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,993
We shall soon have them in custody.

58
00:04:19,074 --> 00:04:21,954
We have tracked them down
to our moon, Concordia.

59
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,596
I hope you're right, Duchess.

60
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:32,760
I do not understand why
the arrival of this Jedi doesn't upset you.

61
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,681
You promised to support
the Death Watch forces

62
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,441
so we could overthrow the Duchess Satine
and her weak, peace-loving government.

63
00:04:38,523 --> 00:04:41,523
And I intend to keep my promise.

64
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,324
But how? If the Republic interferes now,

65
00:04:44,406 --> 00:04:47,045
Death Watch will not be able
to take over the planet.

66
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:51,648
Consider, once the Senate orders
peacekeeping troops to Mandalore,

67
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,170
the people will be surrounded by
a military presence. Most distasteful.

68
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,852
- They will rebel.
- And rally to Death Watch.

69
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:03,333
Our insurgency will grow stronger.

70
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:06,895
Yes. And Duchess Satine shall fall.

71
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:12,660
A peacekeeper belongs
on the front lines of conflict.

72
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:15,142
Otherwise, he wouldn't
be able to do his job.

73
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:20,224
The work of a peacekeeper is
to make sure that conflict does not arise.

74
00:05:20,304 --> 00:05:23,625
Yes, a noble description,
but not a realistic one.

75
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:27,227
Is reality what makes a Jedi
abandon his ideals?

76
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:30,588
Or is it simply a response
to political convenience?

77
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:35,951
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

78
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,675
Hooligans couldn't have arranged
an attack of this scale.

79
00:05:46,437 --> 00:05:48,877
Then this must be the work
of an offworlder.

80
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,598
Are you sure of that?

81
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,402
The sign of the Death Watch.

82
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:02,843
This goes far beyond vandalism.

83
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:05,924
This is a political statement
against your government.

84
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,685
And against you.

85
00:06:07,766 --> 00:06:11,288
You're not safe here.
I'm taking you back to the palace.

86
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:17,210
I want to interview everyone here.
Nobody leaves this scene.

87
00:06:19,772 --> 00:06:21,132
You there!

88
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,939
I only want to talk.

89
00:06:47,424 --> 00:06:49,184
I don't want to hurt you.

90
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,105
Stay back!

91
00:07:23,681 --> 00:07:25,241
What is he saying?

92
00:07:38,008 --> 00:07:42,649
He was speaking in the dialect
they use on Concordia, our moon.

93
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:47,251
I should like to visit this moon of yours.
Perhaps I could accompany the body.

94
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,572
The Concordian moon is a province
with its own governor.

95
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:52,254
You'll need me to escort you.

96
00:07:52,374 --> 00:07:55,535
- That won't be necessary.
- Actually, it will.

97
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:57,935
You won't make much progress
without me there,

98
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:01,338
especially since you've just been involved
with the death of a Concordian.

99
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,819
- I didn't kill him.
- I know.

100
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,939
That's why I'm still talking to you.

101
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:30,311
I thought Concordia was
an agricultural settlement.

102
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:33,912
Before the end of our wars,
they turned it into a mining base.

103
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,954
The sheer number of mining facilities here
nearly destroyed our forests.

104
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:39,716
They're finally growing back.

105
00:08:56,963 --> 00:09:00,845
- Duchess Satine. You are most welcome.
- Thank you, Governor Vizsla.

106
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:05,367
May I present Master Obi-Wan Kenobi,
representing the Jedi Council.

107
00:09:05,488 --> 00:09:08,047
Governor Vizsla
is one of the officials I spoke of.

108
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,569
He has been working to find
the members of the Death Watch.

109
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,210
I take it you've heard the rumors
about Satine.

110
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,451
About how she's supposedly
leading Mandalore

111
00:09:15,573 --> 00:09:17,493
into an alliance with the Separatists.

112
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,893
My only instructions are to seek the truth.

113
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,975
This was the man
who bombed the Memorial Shrine?

114
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,936
Yes. He was apparently
part of Death Watch.

115
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,377
A worrisome prospect.

116
00:09:28,418 --> 00:09:30,818
If you'll pardon me, General,
we must attend to the body

117
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,823
I need a favor from you.

118
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:38,384
Please keep Governor Vizsla
occupied at dinner.

119
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:41,226
- Where are you going?
- Just for a look around.

120
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:43,987
I'd like to see one of these
mining facilities for myself.

121
00:09:44,068 --> 00:09:47,429
You mean you want to determine
if they're still operational.

122
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,830
I hope to determine they're not.

123
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:53,472
I want you to wear this earpiece
so that we can stay in contact,

124
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:56,033
in case you run into trouble
while I'm gone.

125
00:09:58,195 --> 00:10:00,915
Remember that you are here
under my protection.

126
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:04,436
Please try not to cause problems
where none yet exist.

127
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,878
Think of me as searching for solutions.

128
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,159
I have to tell you,
I'm opposed to all of this.

129
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:13,001
I'd be disappointed if you weren't.

130
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,608
Forgive me, Duchess.

131
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:31,529
I'm writing a condolence letter
to the dead man's family

132
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:34,250
and making arrangements
for them to retrieve his body.

133
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,052
Of course, Governor. Very proper.

134
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:41,294
General Kenobi will join us shortly.
He said he needed to meditate.

135
00:11:09,507 --> 00:11:11,827
It doesn't look abandoned to me.

136
00:11:34,479 --> 00:11:39,160
I am here on a diplomatic mission
under the protection of Duchess Satine.

137
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,440
We do not recognize her rule.

138
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:57,888
Someone is feeding misinformation
directly to the Republic Senate,

139
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:01,169
saying that the Death Watch
is taking over Mandalore.

140
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:03,731
Who stands to gain from these lies?

141
00:12:04,573 --> 00:12:06,092
Death Watch, of course.

142
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:08,013
They could not engineer all this.

143
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,654
The problem has clearly grown
much larger than we thought,

144
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:15,216
and I suspect
some external force helped it along.

145
00:12:15,297 --> 00:12:17,338
Hard to believe.
It would have to be someone

146
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:20,138
at the highest level of influence
among the Separatists.

147
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,340
But why target me?

148
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:26,502
You lead the Council of Neutral Systems.
Thus you threaten the Separatists' goals.

149
00:12:26,582 --> 00:12:28,062
Take it as a compliment.

150
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:31,624
Someone very powerful
is working towards your downfall.

151
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,112
The commander wants us
to sweep the area

152
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:50,352
and check for any other Jedi
until he arrives.

153
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:54,154
This one's harmless enough
without his lightsaber.

154
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:56,195
The boss will love this.

155
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,960
General Kenobi's meditation
is taking a rather long time.

156
00:13:07,282 --> 00:13:10,761
You know the Jedi,
they never do anything by halves.

157
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:12,963
Duchess, please acknowledge.

158
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:16,765
- May I offer you another drink?
- Yes. Certainly.

159
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:20,126
I'm in a bit of an awkward spot.
I'm being held by the Death Watch.

160
00:13:20,807 --> 00:13:22,848
Sorry, Duchess. We're out of ice.

161
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,209
Sorry to hear that.

162
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,251
Perhaps we should begin dinner
without General Kenobi.

163
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,893
There's a tracking function on your comlink.
Follow it due east to my location.

164
00:13:33,974 --> 00:13:36,454
I don't know if I can do that
at the moment.

165
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:40,175
- It's extremely urgent!
- Are you not feeling well, Duchess?

166
00:13:40,256 --> 00:13:43,217
Perhaps some fresh air would do me good.

167
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,618
Shall I escort you outside?

168
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,619
Take a speeder,
it's rough terrain.

169
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,980
Oh, I'll find my way, never fear.

170
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,510
Yes, sir.

171
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:15,511
Start the machine. Time for the Jedi
to meet with his fatal accident.

172
00:14:15,872 --> 00:14:17,312
With pleasure.

173
00:14:26,878 --> 00:14:28,437
This is not good.

174
00:14:37,883 --> 00:14:39,442
Where exactly are you?

175
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:43,083
Listen for the loud, metallic,
clanging sound.

176
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:45,605
That would be the machine
about to smash me into bits.

177
00:14:58,893 --> 00:15:01,933
There's some kind of disturbance
at the entrance. Let's check it out.

178
00:15:08,977 --> 00:15:10,737
Well, it certainly took you long enough.

179
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:12,898
You know, I haven't saved you yet!

180
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:16,339
- Yes, no need to remind me of that.
- Be patient.

181
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,460
I happen to be a bit short on patience
right now!

182
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,102
Now, let's see, one of these...

183
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:28,585
- Satine, turn the machine off!
- I'm trying!

184
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:29,865
Satine!

185
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,187
There!

186
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,271
Look out!

187
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,319
For a man sworn to peace,

188
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,761
you take an unseemly pleasure
in the injuries of others.

189
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,282
For a woman sworn to non-violence,

190
00:16:05,323 --> 00:16:08,043
you don't seem troubled
that I could have been killed back there.

191
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:12,165
But you weren't.
And yet I still haven't heard any thanks.

192
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:14,766
Well, you certainly haven't changed much.

193
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:21,009
This is not the way we came in.

194
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,810
Look there, it's the Jedi.

195
00:16:36,658 --> 00:16:40,298
We'll have to stand and fight.
Or in your case, just stand.

196
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:46,020
You three, stop him.

197
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:10,792
You there!

198
00:17:17,676 --> 00:17:19,556
- Satine!
- I'm all right.

199
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:23,037
I'll deal with this.
Get to your ships and evacuate.

200
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:41,526
Failure.

201
00:17:54,492 --> 00:17:55,613
Governor?

202
00:17:55,654 --> 00:18:00,254
For generations, my ancestors fought
proudly as warriors against the Jedi.

203
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:04,216
Now that woman tarnishes
the very name Mandalorian.

204
00:18:05,338 --> 00:18:06,938
Defend her, if you will.

205
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,981
This lightsaber was stolen
from your Jedi Temple

206
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:17,703
by my ancestors
during the fall of the Old Republic.

207
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,424
Since then, many Jedi have died
upon its blade.

208
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:23,625
Prepare yourself to join them.

209
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:12,608
Warriors, finish him!

210
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:24,653
Satine?

211
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:39,340
- Should we go after him, sir?
- No, there's no time.

212
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,901
Don't worry, we'll catch up
with the Duchess soon enough.

213
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:47,423
I suppose we're even now.

214
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:51,785
- Oh? How so?
- I saved your life, you saved mine.

215
00:19:51,827 --> 00:19:55,708
Yes, well, mine was the more daring
of the two rescues.

216
00:20:04,472 --> 00:20:05,712
But if Pre Vizsla fled,

217
00:20:05,753 --> 00:20:10,234
we have no way of learning
how widespread Death Watch really is.

218
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,235
It's obvious the Separatists
are supporting the Death Watch.

219
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:18,758
I disagree. I told you
I wanted to stay out of this conflict.

220
00:20:19,199 --> 00:20:24,961
Given the current situation,
I'm afraid that may no longer be possible.

221
00:20:25,763 --> 00:20:31,364
I thought you of all people would
understand my position on this matter.

222
00:20:31,484 --> 00:20:34,245
I will never be a part of this war.

223
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,209
Reporting for escort duty, General.

224
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,410
Oh. Anakin, am I glad to see you.

225
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,932
You sound tired.

226
00:20:48,973 --> 00:20:52,493
The peaceful ways of the locals
wore me out a bit.
