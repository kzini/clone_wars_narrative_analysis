1
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,110
<i>Secret transmission intercepted!</i>

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,610
<i>The Jedi Council has intercepted</i>

3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,910
<i>an encoded transmission
of General Grievous.</i>

4
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,340
<i>However, Republic Intelligence officers</i>

5
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,380
<i>have failed to crack
the new encryption code</i>

6
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,980
<i>being used by the droids.</i>

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>Fears escalate that the Separatists</i>

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,220
<i>are about to mount a major offensive.</i>

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,050
<i>Having located the source
of the transmission</i>

10
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,820
<i>deep in Separatist space,</i>

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,390
<i>the Jedi plan a counterstrike</i>

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,690
<i>to capture an enemy decoding chip</i>

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,960
<i>which will allow them
to understand the transmission</i>

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,110
<i>and thwart the Separatist plot.</i>

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,740
Time is not on our side,
so I'll make this short.

16
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,510
You droids have been chosen
for a very important mission.

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,140
There's an encryption module

18
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,080
on board this Separatist dreadnought.

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,880
This device is scrambling
all Separatist communication

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,210
in the region.

21
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,120
We believe you five
can get behind enemy lines,

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,320
infiltrate the vault

23
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,320
without drawing attention to yourselves,

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,070
and steal that encryption module.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,270
WAC-47, reporting for duty!

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,300
Sorry I am late.

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,710
I thought the message said to meet

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,340
in the "Jedi storeroom",
whatever that is.

29
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:32,470
Heh.

30
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,470
So did I miss anything?

31
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,110
Fall in line, soldier.

32
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,420
So I hear we're
gonna be taking out Separatists.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,830
I will be honest.

34
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,060
Some of you may not make it back.

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,936
What... why is he looking at me?

36
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,430
Uh, were you just looking at me?

37
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,200
I... I was just kidding.

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,370
But I have faith in your abilities.

39
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,870
You are not ordinary droids.

40
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,910
You've worked with the Jedi before.

41
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,256
You are our secret weapons.

42
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,120
Now, let me turn you over
to your mission leader.

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,290
The colonel is one of our top minds

44
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,920
at Strategic Command.

45
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,790
He's been with the Republic
since the Battle of Geonosis,

46
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,200
Colonel Meebur Gascon.

47
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,170
Thank you, Master Windu.

48
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,650
I'll take it from here.

49
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,120
May the Force be with you.

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,950
Attention!

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,860
Now, I'm only gonna say this once,

52
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,390
so turn up your audio inputs.

53
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:06,700
Once we're inside the cruiser,
we make our way to "C" deck.

54
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,170
That's where their
communication center is housed.

55
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,570
We bypass security here and here,

56
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,580
divert the super battle droids here.

57
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,970
Then we break the vault code,
beat the swarm mines,

58
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,380
steal the encryption module,

59
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,840
and return home in time
for my promotion ceremony

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,110
to brigadier general.

61
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,450
Are we clear?

62
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,860
Uh... uh...

63
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,560
Good, that's what I like:

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,230
No questions.

65
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,830
Oh.

66
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:40,100
D-Squad, fall in line!

67
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,210
The line starts behind me, mech.

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,580
Clang!

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,970
Over here, you mechs, front and center.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,070
This is Dr. Gubacher.

71
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,200
- He is...
- Uh, uh, Corporal?

72
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,217
Colonel.

73
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,440
Right.

74
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,810
Well, I just want
to set the record straight.

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,086
I am not a mech.

76
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,850
You called us all mechs back there,

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,420
but as you can see, I am a WAC.

78
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,450
Granted, my master's not a Jedi,

79
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,890
but I am a different class of droid...

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,620
better engineering.

81
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:47,100
As I was saying,
before I was rudely interrupted,

82
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:50,100
Dr. Gubacher
is going to equip each of you

83
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,540
with a tactical upgrade

84
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,740
specially designed for this mission.

85
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,940
All right, enough with the chatter.

86
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,120
Let's get this show on the road.

87
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,656
Cyclops,

88
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,750
you're not needed here.

89
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,750
Go prepare our shuttle for launch.

90
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,530
R2-D2,

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,600
these advanced rocket boosters

92
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:22,270
should give you better aerial mobility

93
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,170
and for longer periods of time.

94
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
Ah, but be advised:

95
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,570
The navigation controls
are finely tuned.

96
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,510
QT-KT,

97
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,590
this coil
is a remote-controlled magnet.

98
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,830
It can attract any metal object
in a seven-meter radius.

99
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,850
But when dealing with mines,

100
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,490
you'll want to take care.

101
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,530
The magnetic force
is extremely powerful.

102
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,860
U9-C4, this laser-cutter

103
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,330
will slice through most
materials you encounter.

104
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,670
But make sure
you're in a locked position.

105
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,640
The recoil packs quite a wallop.

106
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,050
No, no, no, no, no.

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,680
M5-BZ, we are not
putting anything inside you.

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,790
We're taking something out:

109
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,390
Your memory banks.

110
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,590
I'll be making the extraction myself

111
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,060
in the salvage room.

112
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,030
I am sorry,

113
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,130
but we need to make room

114
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,600
for the colonel's command center.

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,570
No need to baby him.

116
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,940
He's just a droid.

117
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,520
Fortunately,
he won't remember any of this.

118
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,630
What do you want, BZ?

119
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,130
It's me, you moron.

120
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,970
What are you doing in there, Corporal?

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,900
And how many times
do I have to tell you?

122
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,900
It's colonel.

123
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,040
Nice setup.

124
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,740
I want to know
why I did not get an upgrade.

125
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,880
Because you are just a pilot!

126
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
Now do your job

127
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,880
and pilot this ship!

128
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:30,120
Just a pilot...
we will see about that.

129
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,990
All right, Cyclops, listen up.

130
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,560
I want you to alert me
when we near the dreadnought.

131
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,436
I have a plan on how
to attract their attention.

132
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,660
Relax.

133
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,610
I already took care of it.

134
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,670
What do you mean?

135
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,600
What did you do?

136
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,810
I put us on a collision course
with the dreadnought.

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,497
See, Corporal?

138
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,760
I am not just a pilot.

139
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,960
You idiot!

140
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,060
We're caught in a tractor beam.

141
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,050
Hold it right there.

142
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,020
Out of the way, tin cans.

143
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,890
Let's check the cockpit.

144
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,000
No sign of life, just these droids.

145
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,710
Continue your search

146
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:14,380
while I take these droids
in for interrogation.

147
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,550
Everyone just stay calm.

148
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,760
Oh, my gosh!

149
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,030
You are Republic droids!

150
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,830
That is right, and I am their leader.

151
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,470
Yeah, I got him.

152
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,900
Well, thanks for the assist, QT.

153
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,650
All right, listen up.

154
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,820
The next phase of my plan
is to reach "C" deck.

155
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,590
We'll take this path here.

156
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,530
Since the mechs
won't draw much attention,

157
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,000
we'll go in a convoy.

158
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,960
Cyclops, you lead the way.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,030
If anyone asks,

160
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,170
you're taking the droids
on a repair job.

161
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,177
Got it?

162
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,870
Yes, sir, uh...

163
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:19,887
Captain.

164
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,140
It's colonel!

165
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,580
I swear, Cyclops.

166
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,480
You are gonna drive me crazy.

167
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,890
Now, I want flat top

168
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,960
to locate the comm-vault
power supply

169
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,960
then use his laser to cut the main line

170
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,360
and cause a temporary loss in power.

171
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,700
You can do it, C4!

172
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,180
Oh, do not forget
to lock down your...

173
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,790
Sir, there was a temporary
power loss on "C" deck.

174
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,000
Has
the power been reestablished?

175
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,560
Yes.

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,900
It was only a temporary fluctuation.

177
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,000
Hmm, curious.

178
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,570
All right, listen up.

179
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,587
Cutting the power

180
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:28,380
put the comm-vault
security system

181
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,280
in manual override.

182
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,050
But someone still has to distract

183
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,550
some super battle droids.

184
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,350
Oh, please, please, please.

185
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,556
Let me do it, come on, come on,

186
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,890
come on, come on, let me do it, please.

187
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Come on, come on.

188
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,990
All right.

189
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,360
You will not regret this, corporal.

190
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,390
I am not a...

191
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,040
Halt.

192
00:11:56,070 --> 00:11:58,070
I have been ordered by General Grievous

193
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,670
to test comm-vault security.

194
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,540
And I need your help.

195
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,580
Now, follow me.

196
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,226
Now, I will go inside
the comm-vault

197
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,020
and send out a power surge.

198
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,690
I need you two to stay here.

199
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,530
It will not be safe for you
while I am working.

200
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,076
Are we clear?

201
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,370
Yes, but...

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,376
Good.

203
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,377
That is what I like:

204
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:30,570
No questions.

205
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,040
Huh?

206
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,010
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much.

207
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,026
Shh.

208
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,027
Quiet.

209
00:12:39,051 --> 00:12:40,550
We need to keep moving.

210
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,280
BZ, open the comm-vault
security door.

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Uh, make sure it
is not booby-trapped.

212
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,130
You blockhead!

213
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,400
Now we're going to lose manual override.

214
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:04,800
You... you terminated BZ.

215
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,710
It's not my fault
he fried his circuitry.

216
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,180
I didn't tell that nitwit
to attack the access panel.

217
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,750
So what do we do now, Corporal?

218
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,290
Look, we can still salvage this mission.

219
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,660
If one of you could just...

220
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,890
you need to reaccess that panel,

221
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,500
and we have to open
that comm-vault door fast

222
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:33,400
and grab the encryption module
before we're caught red-handed.

223
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:37,430
No, I will not do it myself.

224
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,800
I'm an officer.

225
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:44,410
I've got no experience
in this type of crisis maneuver.

226
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,910
You fought in the Battle of Geonosis.

227
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,480
That did not prepare you for a crisis?

228
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,926
Well, technically,
I didn't fight in that battle.

229
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,950
I'm a military analyst
by trade and...

230
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,790
You are a map reader?

231
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,930
I am an accomplished
battlefield strategist.

232
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,930
I analyze the enemy terrain
and plot a course to victory.

233
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,000
In other words, you read maps.

234
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,976
You're off base here, Cyclops!

235
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,070
I was chosen for my fearsome cunning,

236
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,240
although my size
may have played a small factor.

237
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,610
But do not think for a moment

238
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,610
that Colonel Meebur Gascon

239
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,250
is going to relinquish command
of this mission.

240
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,420
I have waited a lifetime
for this opportunity,

241
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,190
and some ragtag collection of droids

242
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,130
is not going to deny me my destiny.

243
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,530
So one way or another,

244
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,860
I will open
that comm-vault door.

245
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,670
Oh, there, just like I planned it.

246
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,986
Now, we're
going to infiltrate this vault,

247
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,280
neutralize the swarm mines,

248
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,550
and then secure the encryption module.

249
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,020
Any questions?

250
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,490
Have you ever been in a battle before?

251
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,250
No, I have not.

252
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,590
But if you'd care to see
what I'm made of,

253
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,000
we can go to war right now, you and me,

254
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,600
and probably get ourselves
captured by a Separatist.

255
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,330
Or we can execute my plan

256
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,370
and come out of this mission
looking like heroes.

257
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,040
The choice is yours, Cyclops.

258
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,080
First of all, my name is WAC.

259
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,620
Second of all,
we will execute your plan.

260
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:39,920
But you have to stop calling us
stupid names, Shorty.

261
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,960
Very well, WAC.

262
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,660
I'll play nice,

263
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,300
but only until one of you
screws up again.

264
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,880
Sir, there has been another
disturbance on "C" deck.

265
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,710
I will investigate

266
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,750
this situation personally.

267
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,580
All right, Pinky... I mean, QT.

268
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,350
This is your chance to shine.

269
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:28,550
Use your magnet
to attract those swarm mines.

270
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,150
There it is, the encryption module.

271
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,720
It's all up to you now, R2.

272
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,340
Not so fast.

273
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,830
Arms up.

274
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,540
Gravity.

275
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,547
Pop!

276
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:30,740
Right, turn it off, quick!

277
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:08,810
Thud!

278
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,750
Ah!

279
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
I will help you, Corporal.

280
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,540
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

281
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:38,240
Corporal, are you okay?

282
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Look out!

283
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,830
I will turn the gravity back on.

284
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,260
Hurry, WAC, hurry!

285
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,180
Pop!

286
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,420
I'll take that.

287
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,390
Ha-ha, good work, R2.

288
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,920
Intruder alert.

289
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,220
Intruder alert.

290
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,237
Intruder alert.

291
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:27,990
Intruder alert.

292
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,830
Let's move it out, D-Squad.

293
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,410
What are you doing?

294
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,810
We're going to get caught!

295
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,940
R2 says
we cannot leave BZ behind.

296
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,880
R2's right.

297
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,820
We can repair him on the shuttle.

298
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,190
There's trouble on "C" deck.

299
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,720
Report there immediately.

300
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,070
Get out of the way,
you stupid astromechs.

301
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,580
Funny thing about droids

302
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,110
last thing they'd expect to betray them:

303
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,680
Another droid.

304
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,320
D-Squad, let's go home.

305
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,330
Ah, my first mission...
a rousing success

306
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,000
and a brilliant plan
if I do say so myself.

307
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,400
I agree, R2.

308
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,200
The team's execution was not too shabby.

309
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:23,410
Who knows, you droids

310
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,540
might just make decent soldiers
after all.

311
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,550
Oh, and you, too, WAC.

312
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,820
Yes, sir, Colonel.
