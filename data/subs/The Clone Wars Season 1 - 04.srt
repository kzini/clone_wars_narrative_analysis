1
00:00:17,796 --> 00:00:19,189
<i>Grievous in retreat!</i>

2
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:24,775
<i>Before the battleship Malevolence could
destroy an Outer Rim clone medical base,</i>

3
00:00:24,895 --> 00:00:29,420
<i>a Republic strike force under the
command of Jedi general Anakin Skywalker</i>

4
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:33,476
<i>crippled the warship,
disabling its dreaded ion cannon.</i>

5
00:00:36,925 --> 00:00:40,315
<i>All the Jedi relentlessly persue
the Malevolence.</i>

6
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,684
Commander, what is the damage level
to the enemy ship?

7
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,190
She's lost a primary shield
and stabilizers.

8
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,444
But the ship is so massive, it can take
all the fire our cannons can give it.

9
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:14,015
We must summon reinforcements.

10
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:15,777
That's why I'm here, Master Plo.

11
00:01:15,897 --> 00:01:18,261
Anakin, were you able to contact
Master Luminara?

12
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:21,962
Yes, Master. She's busy with a fleet
of Separatist reinforcements nearby.

13
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:24,701
She won't be able to give us support
until she's turned them away.

14
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,911
Then we'll have to make due
with what we have.

15
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:39,863
We've lost our primary weapon.

16
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:42,534
The hyperdrive has been disabled.

17
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:44,158
General?

18
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,747
General, the forward engines
are shutting down.

19
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:49,042
Impossible!

20
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:56,808
- Admiral, status report.
- They're not attempting to jump

21
00:01:56,927 --> 00:01:59,350
to hyperspace.
Their hyperdrive must be damaged.

22
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:01,034
This is our chance.

23
00:02:01,155 --> 00:02:04,274
All ships, target the bridge,
maximum firepower.

24
00:02:13,994 --> 00:02:17,961
It has not sustained extensive damage.

25
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,564
<i>General, I have arranged a trap</i>

26
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:23,095
<i>which will give you an advantage
over the Jedi.</i>

27
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:25,681
I assure you, that is unnecessary.

28
00:02:25,843 --> 00:02:28,274
<i>Do not compound your failure this day</i>

29
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:31,400
<i>by allowing our prize warship to fall.</i>

30
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:35,700
My lord, they will never capture me
or this ship.

31
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:39,851
<i>Heading towards you
is a very important galactic senator.</i>

32
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:45,003
<i>With her as your hostage,
they will call off their attack.</i>

33
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:47,873
As you wish, my lord.

34
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,937
My lady, are you sure

35
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,388
the information
from chancellor Palpatine is reliable?

36
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:58,537
Yes, it was secretly given to him

37
00:02:58,657 --> 00:03:01,138
by the supreme executive
of the banking clan himself.

38
00:03:01,565 --> 00:03:03,589
If they leave the Separatist alliance,

39
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,913
it will go a long way
to shortening this war.

40
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,160
We're approaching the system now.

41
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,718
My goodness!

42
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,006
This isn't right!

43
00:03:17,125 --> 00:03:20,289
That's a droid warship.
We're in the middle of a battle!

44
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:24,133
Sir, we're scanning a small ship
off our bow.

45
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:27,613
Good.
Our hostage has arrived.

46
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:35,475
Master, I'm picking up a signal
near the enemy vessel.

47
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,587
Something just came
out of hyperspace.

48
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:39,505
- Enemy reinforcements?
- No.

49
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,470
It looks like a Naboo ship.

50
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,704
Gunners, stand down.

51
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:47,094
What in blazes
are they doing out here?

52
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:48,687
Ahsoka, contact that ship.

53
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,548
- <i>Naboo cruiser, identify yourself.</i>
- This is Senator Amidala.

54
00:03:55,667 --> 00:03:57,660
Padmé?
What are you doing out here?

55
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,319
<i>I was sent on a special mission.
The senate was told the banking clan</i>

56
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,126
- <i>wanted to negotiate a treaty.</i>
- Get out of there as fast as you can.

57
00:04:04,885 --> 00:04:07,162
Activate the tractor beam.

58
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:13,016
- Have we been hit?
- I'm afraid it's much worse than that.

59
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:16,773
Padmé, what's happening?

60
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:19,777
<i>I'm being pulled inside
the droid cruiser by a tractor beam.</i>

61
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,417
<i>I will not be made
a Separatist bargaining chip.</i>

62
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:34,341
<i>Continue your attack.
You must destroy this monstrous ship!</i>

63
00:04:38,725 --> 00:04:41,684
Admiral,
order our ships to stop firing.

64
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,969
It does not look safe out there,
my lady.

65
00:04:57,244 --> 00:05:01,089
I see now this whole thing was a trap,
and I'm afraid I walked right into it.

66
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,620
Sir, the Republic cruisers
have halted their attack.

67
00:05:05,086 --> 00:05:07,321
Jedi are so predictable.

68
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:09,419
Get the repair team up here.

69
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:11,841
Continue working on the hyperdrive.

70
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:14,381
I'm going down to the main hangar.

71
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:24,387
This ship must be returned
to Count Dooku intact.

72
00:05:31,313 --> 00:05:33,750
There is no room for failure.

73
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,604
<i>Rail jet departing.</i>

74
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,391
Come on,
I've overloaded the power system.

75
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,826
We're doomed.

76
00:05:46,801 --> 00:05:50,670
- Where do you think you're going?
- Somebody has to save her skin.

77
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:53,089
I thought you might say that.

78
00:05:53,559 --> 00:05:58,121
I'm afraid Master Skywalker
is taking a terrible risk.

79
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,036
You get used to it.

80
00:06:03,975 --> 00:06:05,984
Come on, 3PO, hurry.

81
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:09,323
Hurrying, my lady.
I'm not sure this is such a good idea.

82
00:06:15,637 --> 00:06:18,230
<i>Welcome to rail jet substation 9-4.</i>

83
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,772
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

84
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:21,707
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

85
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,677
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

86
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:25,937
You two, come with me.

87
00:06:36,148 --> 00:06:38,910
Looks like the engines are set
to destroy themselves.

88
00:06:40,086 --> 00:06:41,577
Get out of my way!

89
00:06:41,805 --> 00:06:43,459
Hey, that's just rude!

90
00:06:51,632 --> 00:06:53,480
Watch what you're doing
with that thing.

91
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:02,828
Sound the alarm!

92
00:07:02,948 --> 00:07:04,980
We have stowaways on board.

93
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:15,946
I trust you've already formulated
a brilliant plan to rescue the senator.

94
00:07:16,163 --> 00:07:18,273
As a matter of fact, I have.

95
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,042
But do we have a plan "B"?

96
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:22,212
Every operation
needs a backup, Anakin.

97
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:26,635
I don't have a backup yet, but I do
have a plan for getting on that ship.

98
00:07:27,075 --> 00:07:28,076
Really?

99
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,608
The enemy sensors
are obviously damaged,

100
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:33,793
so we'll sneak in behind them
and dock at the emergency airlock.

101
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,362
That's your plan?

102
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:36,923
Just fly there, land,

103
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:39,406
hope they don't spot us,
and walk in the door?

104
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:40,991
Basically.

105
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,829
Brilliant. Let's get going.

106
00:08:00,096 --> 00:08:02,909
Pardon me, but might I suggest
we keep moving?

107
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:05,236
I think I hear battle droids
approaching.

108
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:07,852
But we also need
to contact the fleet.

109
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:10,828
If I can just get
this comm panel working...

110
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:16,964
My lady, I'm afraid I was right.

111
00:08:23,307 --> 00:08:24,666
- <i>General?</i>
- What?

112
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,861
<i>The damage to the hyperdrive
was not as bad as we first thought.</i>

113
00:08:27,982 --> 00:08:30,276
<i>We should be able to
get under way again shortly.</i>

114
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,529
I must inform Count Dooku.

115
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:33,894
Stay here.

116
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,786
Continue the search.

117
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,013
Find the stowaway
and bring them to me.

118
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,659
Roger, roger.

119
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:03,745
If they spot us,
we'll be pulverized.

120
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:05,999
They're too busy repairing the ship.

121
00:09:06,119 --> 00:09:08,127
They don't have time to notice us.

122
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,212
Subtlety has never been
one of your strong points, Anakin.

123
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:14,596
Everything I know
I learned from you, Master.

124
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,184
If only that were true.

125
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,242
- What was that?
- What?

126
00:09:29,578 --> 00:09:31,606
That noise.
Didn't you hear it?

127
00:09:31,979 --> 00:09:35,127
It sounded like a ship
docking at one of the emergency airlocks.

128
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:39,050
Your circuits are loose.
No one's crazy enough to do that.

129
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:41,428
Anakin, you're crazy.

130
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,808
Spinning is not flying.

131
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:47,562
- But it's a good trick.
- We do not want to be spotted.

132
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,359
- I knew it! It's them!
- Oh, no.

133
00:09:54,201 --> 00:09:55,241
You stay here, R2.

134
00:09:57,084 --> 00:10:00,249
<i>Another bold strategy
by Skywalker, I presume.</i>

135
00:10:00,501 --> 00:10:03,729
- That's my master.
- Once they make it off that ship,

136
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,346
we'll need reinforcements
to finish off the enemy.

137
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,470
<i>I am on my way, Master Plo.</i>

138
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:11,440
We're receiving a transmission
from inside the Malevolence.

139
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,019
I believe it's the senator.

140
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:18,887
- Yes?
- <i>Master, we've found the senator.
I'm patching her through.</i>

141
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,238
- Padmé?
- <i>Anakin.</i>

142
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,147
<i>Are you all right?
Where are you?</i>

143
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:25,537
On the lower levels.
I'm fine, but I don't know for how long.

144
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,792
- Droids are everywhere.
- Obi-Wan and I are on board too.

145
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:30,922
What?
What are you doing here?

146
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:33,172
We came to get you off this ship.

147
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,972
Ahsoka,
how can we get to the senator?

148
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,498
According to our scans,
there seems to be

149
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:39,937
a large open area
in the center of the ship

150
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,147
It should be halfway
between the two of you.

151
00:10:42,623 --> 00:10:44,693
We're on our way.
Did you hear that, Padmé?

152
00:10:45,037 --> 00:10:46,242
I'll be there.

153
00:10:51,898 --> 00:10:55,510
General, we just detected
an unauthorized communication

154
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,299
- coming from within the ship.
- What did it say?

155
00:10:58,869 --> 00:10:59,871
Well...

156
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,028
We don't know.

157
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,838
We didn't catch it in time.

158
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,997
Monitor all internal communications.

159
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:11,860
I want that senator on this bridge.

160
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:21,660
- I don't see her, Anakin.
- She's here, Master. I sense it.

161
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,230
This is where we're supposed
to meet them.

162
00:11:31,071 --> 00:11:32,522
He's probably late again.

163
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:35,133
But we do have company
of another sort.

164
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,201
Blast them!

165
00:11:40,388 --> 00:11:41,304
There!

166
00:11:50,258 --> 00:11:51,700
Look, Jedi.

167
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,433
- Fire!
- No, wait.

168
00:11:56,247 --> 00:11:58,149
I knew that was a bad idea.

169
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,662
Jump!

170
00:12:02,557 --> 00:12:04,067
Who, me?

171
00:12:09,712 --> 00:12:10,554
Padmé!

172
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,899
There they are.

173
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:25,942
Fire!

174
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:32,744
- The bridge is out.
- Jump to me.

175
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,705
You have to trust me.

176
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:42,259
- I've got you.
- Nice catch.

177
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,514
I'll fetch the droid.

178
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:51,147
The things you do to get me alone.

179
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:52,797
Stop talking.

180
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,287
What is going on?

181
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:11,639
Stop me, please!

182
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:14,158
Blast!
That's not good.

183
00:13:15,231 --> 00:13:17,624
Anakin, I got separated
from your droid.

184
00:13:17,744 --> 00:13:18,463
3PO.

185
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:20,585
I'll take care of it.

186
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:23,491
- We'll meet you back at the Twilight.
- No, we can't leave yet.

187
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,578
I overheard Grievous.
Their hyperdrive is almost repaired.

188
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:28,694
I'm already headed
in that direction,

189
00:13:28,814 --> 00:13:31,962
so I'll make certain
that the hyperdrive stays offline.

190
00:13:34,427 --> 00:13:38,137
We'll see about that, Jedi.
Come with me.

191
00:13:38,497 --> 00:13:42,394
I'm getting you out of here.
R2, I need you to help me find 3PO.

192
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:44,010
He's on the rail jet.

193
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,569
I know. I know. He does.

194
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,739
Look, just find him for me,
and I'll be there soon.

195
00:13:55,112 --> 00:13:58,867
Someone stop this contraption,
please!

196
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,051
I suppose I did ask for that.

197
00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:30,602
Hello, there.

198
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,441
General Kenobi,

199
00:14:38,786 --> 00:14:43,032
did you really think I would leave
the hyperdrive unguarded?

200
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:44,742
Anything is possible.

201
00:14:44,862 --> 00:14:46,827
You haven't exactly
impressed me today.

202
00:14:48,564 --> 00:14:49,708
Kill him.

203
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:22,006
That was impressive.

204
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:24,754
Guard the hyperdrive.

205
00:15:24,997 --> 00:15:27,492
I will deal with this Jedi myself.

206
00:15:36,844 --> 00:15:38,900
Obi-Wan? Come in, Obi-Wan.

207
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,862
<i>Anakin,
I'm afraid Grievous is on to us.</i>

208
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,461
Yeah, we noticed.

209
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,549
<i>We'll rendezvous
back at the Twilight.</i>

210
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:49,662
<i>The fleet must engage the--</i>

211
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,847
Obi-Wan? Come in. Obi-Wan!

212
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:53,893
- What's wrong?
- They're jamming us.

213
00:16:04,002 --> 00:16:07,412
- That might buy us some time.
- I suppose you have a plan.

214
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,935
Follow me.

215
00:16:10,548 --> 00:16:13,986
I do believe I'm lost...
in enemy territory...

216
00:16:14,467 --> 00:16:15,634
and all alone.

217
00:16:16,482 --> 00:16:18,790
Don't shoot!
I surrender!

218
00:16:20,464 --> 00:16:21,970
R2-D2! Oh my,

219
00:16:22,468 --> 00:16:24,647
you are a sight for short circuits.

220
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:28,632
Master Anakin sent you to find me?

221
00:16:28,856 --> 00:16:30,234
What kept you then?

222
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,904
The General is demanding
a status report.

223
00:16:37,024 --> 00:16:39,440
Is the hyperdrive repaired yet?

224
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,838
It's almost done.

225
00:16:41,558 --> 00:16:43,372
I'll give him the good news.

226
00:16:57,408 --> 00:17:00,537
Ever since I've known you,
you've been playing with droids.

227
00:17:00,815 --> 00:17:04,652
I used to put them together.
Now I only take them apart.

228
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,213
So where do we start?

229
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:10,438
First we need to get rid of these droids
so they won't know we were here.

230
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,808
I'm gonna hotwire the ship,
give Grievous a little surprise.

231
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:17,186
I guess I'll clean up
the droids then.

232
00:17:20,725 --> 00:17:23,924
Our ships are in attack position.
Any word from Master Skywalker?

233
00:17:24,262 --> 00:17:27,446
No, the droids are jamming
our transmissions.

234
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,682
We need to give him more time.

235
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:31,761
I'm not sure we can.

236
00:18:16,092 --> 00:18:19,109
That ought to do it.
How's the house-cleaning going?

237
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,745
Done.
Let's get out of here.

238
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:27,785
I guess repairs are finished.

239
00:18:27,905 --> 00:18:30,834
- Prepare to charge up the hyperdrive.
- Roger, roger.

240
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:38,581
R2, are you quite certain
the ship is in this direction?

241
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,210
This way looks potentially dangerous.

242
00:18:43,297 --> 00:18:45,466
I know the whole place is dangerous!

243
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,506
I suggest we stay here
and let Master Anakin find us.

244
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,685
3PO, what are you doing?
Don't just stand there.

245
00:18:53,122 --> 00:18:54,648
Let's get back to the ship.

246
00:18:55,486 --> 00:18:58,339
- Power up the engines, R2.
- Hold the ship!

247
00:19:05,105 --> 00:19:06,879
I'll contact the fleet.

248
00:19:08,171 --> 00:19:09,796
R2, release the docking clamp.

249
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:35,920
- Time for some clever tricks, Anakin.
- That's what I was thinking.

250
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:45,560
All batteries, open fire!

251
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:56,562
You know, we have guns.
You can shoot back any time.

252
00:19:56,682 --> 00:19:58,559
- I was just about to...
- I got it.

253
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:06,592
She seems to know her way around.

254
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,456
<i>General, the hyperdrive
has been completely repaired.</i>

255
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:19,516
- <i>Should we retreat to friendly space?</i>
- Engage the hyperdrive.

256
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:23,118
I'll meet you at our secret base
in sector four.

257
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:26,964
You heard the General.
Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.

258
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,084
Yes, sir.

259
00:20:40,262 --> 00:20:42,900
- Nice shot, Senator.
- Beginner's luck.

260
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,840
Pardon me, sir,
but R2's scan of the enemy's ship

261
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:48,916
indicates their hyperdrive
is activating.

262
00:20:49,036 --> 00:20:50,659
- Don't worry about it.
- What?

263
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:54,057
Coordinates are locked.
Hyperdrive is engaging.

264
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,756
I think we have a problem.

265
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,637
<i>General, there's something wrong
with the hyperdrive.</i>

266
00:21:01,018 --> 00:21:03,555
I thought the hyperdrive was fixed.

267
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:07,521
The navi-computer is heading us
right into the moon.

268
00:21:07,865 --> 00:21:10,317
Fools, reset the navi-computer!

269
00:21:10,653 --> 00:21:12,873
Quick, reset the navi-computer!

270
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:19,331
<i>General, we await the Malevolence
at the rendezvous point.</i>

271
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:21,919
<i>Have you made your escape yet?</i>

272
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,444
No, reset it!

273
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:26,983
<i>General?</i>

274
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:29,084
General?

275
00:21:34,549 --> 00:21:37,025
Transmission has been cut off, sir.

276
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:39,530
I think the General did it himself.

277
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,641
We're gonna die! Abandon ship!

278
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:49,711
I imagine you had something
to do with that?

279
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,674
All part of the plan, Master.
