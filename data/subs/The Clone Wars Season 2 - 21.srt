1
00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:17,889
Revenge!

2
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:21,355
Boba Fett, son of the notorious
bounty hunter Jango Fett,

3
00:00:21,437 --> 00:00:26,112
infiltrated a Jedi cruiser in an attempt
to assassinate General Mace Windu,

4
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,731
the man who killed his father.

5
00:00:28,812 --> 00:00:30,947
After a near miss at Windu's quarters,

6
00:00:31,028 --> 00:00:33,243
Boba was forced
to destroy the Jedi cruiser

7
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:36,951
and escape with the help
of notorious bounty hunter Aurra Sing.

8
00:00:37,919 --> 00:00:40,537
Now, having lost contact
with Admiral Kilian

9
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,592
when his doomed starship crashed,

10
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:46,946
the Jedi search for survivors
with the aid of a Republic rescue ship.

11
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:53,674
General Windu, we're picking up
the last of the survivors now.

12
00:00:53,757 --> 00:00:56,859
It's critical to get them
to a hospital station as soon as possible.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,042
We'll contact you as soon as our search
for Admiral Kilian is complete.

14
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:02,903
Let's go, Artoo.

15
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:15,314
We're coming up on the crash site.
Let's hope Admiral Kilian

16
00:01:15,397 --> 00:01:17,853
and the command crew
are still in one piece.

17
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,914
Hmm. Looks pretty bad,
but the bridge seems to be intact.

18
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:28,976
Set down behind the cruiser,
we'll approach on foot.

19
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,345
You're not kidding,
little buddy.

20
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't like the feel of this place either.

21
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,977
Your astromech is programmed to feel?

22
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,216
Artoo is kind of a special case.
He's got a lot of personality, that's all.

23
00:01:57,347 --> 00:01:59,441
You encourage it too much.

24
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:14,392
R8, start scanning the area for signs of life
and calculate an entry point to the cruiser.

25
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:21,243
You're right, Artoo, it doesn't look good.

26
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,928
- A bit jittery, isn't it?
- He must have seen something.

27
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,926
Come on,
it looks like R8 has found an entry point.

28
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:47,557
There would have been a command crew
left aboard to try and land this ship.

29
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:50,781
Admiral Kilian and then
at least three navigational officers.

30
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:52,594
Commander Ponds stayed as well.

31
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,019
What did you find, little guy?

32
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:15,041
Mace, over here!

33
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:24,713
Hmm. This man did not die in the crash,
he was executed.

34
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,542
There's another one over here.
Same thing.

35
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,499
We know the assassins were after me.
Perhaps they returned to look for my body.

36
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,641
We need to get to the bridge
to find Admiral Kilian.

37
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:39,583
Send the droids to scan
for any survivors down here.

38
00:03:39,665 --> 00:03:41,074
Maybe the killer missed one.

39
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:43,250
I know there's a lot of interference,

40
00:03:43,332 --> 00:03:44,903
but do your best.

41
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:46,313
Skywalker!

42
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:33,220
They must have been sucked into space
when the cabin lost pressure.

43
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:42,448
Captain, there's no sign
of any life down here.

44
00:04:43,707 --> 00:04:47,049
Take the survivors back to the
hospital station. We'll meet you there.

45
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,425
- Mace out.
- Captain Silver out.

46
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:51,761
Head for home. Light speed.

47
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,398
Is that a Mandalorian helmet?

48
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,427
What is that doing here?

49
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,414
Clone cadets.

50
00:06:07,637 --> 00:06:08,884
Jango Fett.

51
00:06:12,188 --> 00:06:13,313
Boba!

52
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:17,141
Anakin! No! Drop it!

53
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:43,076
Mace is dead. Are you happy now?

54
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,060
I want to make sure he's dead.

55
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,527
There's nothing left of Windu to find, Boba.

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,749
I want to get off this planet now.

57
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,290
This place is crawling with gundarks,

58
00:06:58,372 --> 00:07:02,030
and besides, we've got these hostages
to drag along with us now.

59
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,088
This extra baggage will fetch us
a hefty sum from the Separatists.

60
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:10,465
Well, it's a lot of trouble
for not enough payout, if you ask me.

61
00:07:11,341 --> 00:07:14,682
You haven't even done anything!
I've taken all the risks.

62
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:16,154
Quiet, runt.

63
00:07:18,145 --> 00:07:19,855
I wouldn't do that.

64
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,618
Count Dooku will pay us well
if we bring back the Jedi's head.

65
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,443
Dooku might pay us for killing Windu.

66
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,193
Then we're looking at a profit.

67
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:33,184
Well...

68
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,043
Now, relax. Boba is right.

69
00:07:37,084 --> 00:07:39,788
To get paid,
we need proof of Windu's death,

70
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:43,210
and if we killed Skywalker,
we can ask for double.

71
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:48,183
- Double?
- Yes, but we need proof.

72
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,639
Bossk, take care of our guests
while we're gone.

73
00:08:23,951 --> 00:08:26,099
Artoo! Over here!

74
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:34,335
Good to see you, buddy.

75
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,102
Careful, Artoo.
I'm afraid the whole bridge will collapse.

76
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:47,524
I need you to go back to the fighters
and call the Temple for help, okay?

77
00:08:49,344 --> 00:08:50,475
Okay?

78
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:56,665
Go get help.
We'll hold out as long as we can.

79
00:08:57,596 --> 00:08:59,052
Go on, Artoo.

80
00:09:00,266 --> 00:09:01,399
Go on.

81
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,766
Come on. We've got to find Windu's body.

82
00:09:32,951 --> 00:09:34,205
Careful, Boba.

83
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:47,309
Yeah, careful. I'd hate
to only split the money three ways.

84
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,343
Look out!

85
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:21,492
This place is a death trap!

86
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:26,265
When I hired you, I didn't realize
that you were such a coward.

87
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:29,218
Well, I don't want to be next.

88
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:35,812
- Blast!
- The door must have malfunctioned.

89
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:49,889
Skywalker? Skywalker, are you all right?

90
00:10:50,376 --> 00:10:54,772
Yeah, I'm okay.
Except I can't move.

91
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,190
Can you get free?

92
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:07,451
I already tried that.

93
00:11:07,491 --> 00:11:09,393
You'll bring the whole place down on us.

94
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:13,751
Well, how do we plan
on getting ourselves out of this mess?

95
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:18,070
Don't worry. I already sent Artoo
back to the fighters to call for help.

96
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,130
I'm sure he has everything under control.

97
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,596
Mmm.

98
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:26,232
I'm just saying, I didn't know
there'd be all this climbing involved.

99
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:29,361
Shut up already. It wasn't my idea
for you to tag along anyway.

100
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,204
The next one who says anything
will get a blaster bolt through the brain.

101
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:35,701
But, Aurra...
Not one more word.

102
00:11:49,925 --> 00:11:51,668
Incoming!

103
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:58,403
What was that?
- The ship is falling apart around us.

104
00:11:58,681 --> 00:12:00,661
This is no good.

105
00:12:00,742 --> 00:12:04,901
If we can barely survive in here,
Windu must have been killed in the blast.

106
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:07,872
I'm not quitting now.
Not when I'm so close.

107
00:12:22,216 --> 00:12:23,245
Look out!

108
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:26,811
We're running out of time.

109
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:32,676
That's it. We're out of here.
No one could survive this place.

110
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:34,181
A Jedi could.

111
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:37,589
I hate to agree with Castas,
but there is a better way to do this.

112
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,014
But, Aurra...

113
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,701
Bossk, fire up Slave I.

114
00:12:47,296 --> 00:12:50,069
We're going to blast
what's left of this ship to pieces.

115
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,922
I'll be ready when you arrive.

116
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,957
- I hate just sitting here.
- Calm yourself, Skywalker.

117
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:10,741
We'll soon see if the faith you put
in that droid is worth it.

118
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:57,183
What was that?

119
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:03,614
Scanners picked up an explosion
near where the Jedi landed.

120
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:07,128
- Windu.
- Jam any communications off this planet.

121
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:33,763
- The fighter's markings match Windu's.
- I knew it! I told you he wasn't dead.

122
00:14:33,884 --> 00:14:35,321
Bossk, after him.

123
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:48,739
I don't like the sound of that.

124
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:51,335
Artoo?

125
00:14:52,294 --> 00:14:55,568
I thought your astromech
was supposed to call for help,

126
00:14:55,647 --> 00:14:57,843
not take off and leave us here.

127
00:15:02,038 --> 00:15:04,592
Come on, Artoo, I'm counting on you.

128
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:21,282
Hold it steady.

129
00:15:26,586 --> 00:15:28,858
We've knocked out his communications.

130
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,969
Two rings, mark three-five,
they're powering up.

131
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,803
If we can take out the rings,
he'll be trapped.

132
00:15:46,681 --> 00:15:49,271
- Which one?
- Destroy them both!

133
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:54,017
We can't get range.
You'll get one shot at this, kid.

134
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,353
I've got you, Windu.

135
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,054
No!

136
00:16:10,524 --> 00:16:13,633
Well, there goes a fortune. Nice work, kid.

137
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,853
What's our next move?

138
00:16:19,893 --> 00:16:22,006
Great! Well, this has gone well.

139
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:27,548
Windu will be back here with a fleet.
He'll hunt us down.

140
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:30,778
Don't count on it.
The Jedi don't carry grudges.

141
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:36,059
But I have ways of motivating him.

142
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:41,599
We'll make Windu come to us next time,
on our terms.

143
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:44,651
Now, let's get out of here.
I want to regroup.

144
00:17:02,836 --> 00:17:06,007
We shall reinforce our fleet
along the Hydian Way,

145
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:10,342
this should prevent Grievous from...

146
00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,430
Artoo?

147
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,225
Stop it! Artoo, what's wrong?

148
00:17:24,153 --> 00:17:28,768
- Ahsoka, you know this droid?
- It's Anakin's droid, R2-D2.

149
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:34,629
Well, then, Artoo, deliver the message
you so obviously need to communicate.

150
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:41,453
I need you to go back to the fighters
and call the Temple for help, okay?

151
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,224
Okay?

152
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,872
Prepare my ship.
We shall leave immediately.

153
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,725
Whose helmet is that anyway?

154
00:18:01,806 --> 00:18:05,258
It belongs to a bounty hunter
I killed on Geonosis,

155
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,506
by the name of Jango Fett.

156
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,798
You mean the clone template?

157
00:18:10,879 --> 00:18:14,371
Yes. Strangely enough he had a son,

158
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,783
or at least a clone he regarded as a son.

159
00:18:18,426 --> 00:18:20,473
His name is Boba Fett.

160
00:18:20,675 --> 00:18:24,647
I remember now. Obi-Wan listed him
in his report on Kamino.

161
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:28,421
Boba was on Geonosis
when his father died.

162
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,789
He watched as I killed him.

163
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:35,446
- That would complicate things.
- Indeed.

164
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:49,898
Your astromech has been gone too long.

165
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,147
He must have failed
to deliver your message.

166
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:55,076
Artoo will come through.

167
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:14,145
There! In the bridge, I can see them.

168
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:17,958
Ahsoka, hold the ship steady.

169
00:19:27,352 --> 00:19:28,436
Comet! Let's go!

170
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,136
Hurry, Commander Wolffe!

171
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:35,742
Hold tight, General.

172
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,066
We're losing it, sir.

173
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:45,778
Jump!

174
00:19:47,746 --> 00:19:48,788
Cut the lines!

175
00:19:50,154 --> 00:19:51,156
Go!

176
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,666
Some pretty serious burns,

177
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,834
but nothing
a night in the bacta tank won't fix.

178
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,804
Oh, sorry.

179
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,373
We were lucky to arrive when we did.

180
00:20:18,495 --> 00:20:20,420
Guess we have Artoo to thank for that.

181
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,436
Come here, droid.

182
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:29,614
I can see why your master trusts you,
little one.

183
00:20:30,457 --> 00:20:31,742
Good job.

184
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:39,088
That's definitely more praise
than I ever get.

185
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,211
Mmm.
