1
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,920
Evil plans!

2
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,700
With the Jedi Council
focused on the war effort,

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,830
criminal minds are left unchecked
to spread fear and corruption.

4
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,840
Galactic gangster Jabba the Hutt
has sent bounty hunter Cad Bane

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,170
on a nefarious mission which shall strike
at the heart of the Republic.

6
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,100
Meanwhile, the unsuspecting citizens
of Coruscant go about their daily lives.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,640
Wait, no.

8
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,810
The tendrils belong on the main table
between Anakin and Senator Aang.

9
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,190
- Mistress.
- Not that one.

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,860
The red one,
Senator Aang's favorite color is red.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,070
Very well.

12
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,070
You need to take a breath.
This party will work out.

13
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,610
It has to.

14
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,990
Senator Aang holds the deciding vote
on the Military Oversight Committee.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,660
You know how particular the Roonan are.
I need everything to be perfect.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,500
You have nothing to worry about.

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,750
Perfect!

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,050
For the most important
state banquet of the season,

19
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,960
they send us waiter droids
with malfunctioning digits.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,840
It will be okay.

21
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,010
Those are much too large.
Have you seen the size of Roonan teeth?

22
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,770
Tiny. Tiny!

23
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:25,970
- Right away.
- Sir?

24
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,030
That won't do at all.

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,610
This is a social gathering
for the communal taking of sustenance.

26
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,540
Your effort evokes the terror of younglings
fleeing a flesh-eating monster.

27
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,830
Okay, then.

28
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,660
Oh, my! The garnish!

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,700
Artoo! I ask you to oversee one thing
and you allow this?

30
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,790
Threepio, is there a problem?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,300
I am sorry, my lady, but it appears
the dessert is missing its jogan fruit.

32
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,800
So go get one.

33
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,930
I could not possibly leave now.

34
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:02,430
- Threepio...
- Fine, send Artoo, then.

35
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,180
I'm afraid that may not be
the most appropriate idea.

36
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,690
It was R2-D2 who put us
in this predicament,

37
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,480
quite inadvertently, I'm sure.

38
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,270
Please handle this.

39
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,860
Um...

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,860
Okay. Threepio, look,
I'm sending you on a mission.

41
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:20,700
A mission? Oh, my!

42
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,130
Yes, and Artoo is going along with you.

43
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,490
Oh, my.

44
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,580
This should be more than enough credits
if you don't get swindled.

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:31,210
Swindled? Me?

46
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,840
Yes, you. Go there, come back.

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,090
Don't get lost, and don't get distracted.

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,600
Of course, Master Anakin.
Come along, Artoo.

49
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,230
Lost! Distracted! I cannot imagine
where Master Anakin gets these ideas.

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,360
You are the one who gets distracted.

51
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,160
You most certainly do.
You wander off like a drunken nuna.

52
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,410
I have half a mind to recalibrate
your focusing capacitors.

53
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,210
There they are. The gold one is the target.

54
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,760
Now, get down there and do your job.

55
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,090
At your service, Mr. Bane.

56
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:29,720
Here we are. Now, listen and learn.

57
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,190
Excuse me, fine sir,
but do you by any chance have jogan fruit?

58
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,150
Do I have jogan?
Can a Jedi use the Force?

59
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,530
I shall take that as a yes.
How much would four cost?

60
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,740
How much you got, my friend?

61
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,580
Artoo, make sure you watch our credits.

62
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,250
My grandpa always told me, "Don't
watch your credits, watch your health."

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,210
So while I was watching my health,

64
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,510
someone stole my credits.

65
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,260
My grandpa!

66
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,570
A cautionary tale, indeed.
Might I please purchase four jogan?

67
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,520
Your lucky day.
Only ones left on the planet. Four credits.

68
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,990
Four, that seems fair.

69
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,400
Each.

70
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,780
I don't need you to tell me
what galactic robbery is!

71
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,240
But what choice do we have?

72
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,200
Very well, we will take them.

73
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,620
- Sixteen credits.
- I meant, 32!

74
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,710
You said four each! Four times four is 16!

75
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,730
Thirty-two's the best deal we got today.
Hard times.

76
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,010
Very well, 32, but not one credit more!

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,680
You drive a hard bargain.

78
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,060
They're leaving.

79
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,570
Todo, move into position.

80
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,030
I have them marked.

81
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,380
As if you could have done any better.

82
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,160
Anyway, we still have eight credits left.

83
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,880
Which is all you need
to revitalize the you inside.

84
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,170
Excuse me, but were you speaking to us?

85
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,890
No, I'm talking to the you you used to be,

86
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,430
that droid fresh off the assembly line.

87
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,890
Once so nimble before joints squeaked
and wiring frayed.

88
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,890
You remember that sparkling fellow?

89
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,560
I am afraid that was a long time ago,
and my friend and I...

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,390
Could use a makeover, could you?

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,940
Well... No.
No, our master was most insistent

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,780
that we shouldn't deviate from our task,
so this is no time for self-indulgence.

93
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,860
Come along, Artoo.

94
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,530
I said, come along, Artoo!

95
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,950
He's right. You should hear me out.

96
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,210
We have no time for this, Artoo.

97
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,380
But a trip to a maintenance bar
would take no time at all.

98
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,880
A maintenance bar for droids?

99
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,720
After all, why should organics be
the only ones who get pampered?

100
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,430
They should not.
That is why right across the street

101
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,810
there is an oasis of pleasure
designed to put you back in touch

102
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,310
with the original assembly-line you.

103
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,650
R2-D2, where are you going?

104
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,440
We must get back
to the banquet preparation.

105
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,110
As head of protocol, it is vital...

106
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,150
Oh...

107
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,000
Hello and welcome to Droid Spa.

108
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,010
No need for an appointment.
Right this way.

109
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,680
Please, come inside.

110
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,270
Enjoy yourself.

111
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,480
Oh...

112
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,240
The indignity!

113
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,530
Pardon me, sir, but there appears
to have been a terrible mistake.

114
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,920
I don't think so.

115
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,950
Oh, no, I'm quite right.

116
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,040
Why are you putting that there?

117
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,790
To find out what's inside.

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,170
Inside?
Just the usual capacitors, nothing special.

119
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,760
It doesn't get more soothing than that,
does it?

120
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,280
Oh, my!

121
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,380
Just sit back, we'll take care of you.

122
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,010
Ready for your decarbonizing buff?

123
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,320
I don't want this gibberish!
I want the plans for the Senate building!

124
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't know
what you're talking about.

125
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,980
You're Senator Amidala's personal droid.

126
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,410
I am a protocol droid.
Human-cyborg relations.

127
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,710
I can translate and instruct
on appropriate etiquette,

128
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,280
which in your case, sir,
if you don't mind me saying,

129
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,740
is sorely lacking.

130
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,170
That is exactly the sort of behavior
I am talking about.

131
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,850
According to the analyzer, he is not lying.

132
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:39,050
His head's totally empty of any information
useful to us.

133
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,600
Empty? I protest. I am fluent in over
six million forms of communication.

134
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,390
I have extensive programming
in the correct...

135
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,400
Ain't that great! A brainless droid.
Worthless.

136
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:55,360
My lack of knowledge
is not an impediment at all.

137
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,030
Floor plans, blueprints
are not in my programming.

138
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,360
That was always Artoo's specialty.

139
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:08,080
Artoo? The astromech.
Go fetch me his little pal.

140
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,170
Oh, no! What have I done?

141
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,410
I do not know where your buddy is.

142
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,260
How about taking a look at these items?

143
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,790
Top-drawer titanium,

144
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,760
guaranteed to last longer
than your circuit boards.

145
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:04,090
Hey, if price is the issue,
then I'll knock six credits off.

146
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,980
You're coming with us.

147
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,980
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

148
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,820
Hey, what's with the suction thing
on the cart?

149
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,110
Hey, now. No!

150
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Stop him!

151
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,410
That's the wrong droid!

152
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,210
Murderer! Murderer!

153
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,600
Swindled, me? Might I remind you, sir,

154
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,850
I was once protocol droid
to the chief negotiator

155
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,020
for the entire Manakron system.

156
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,560
Wait a minute, you're not Master Ani.

157
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,860
No. I'm your worst nightmare, pal.

158
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:45,400
You certainly are.
It's all coming back to me now.

159
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,530
Thanks to you, the only thing coming back
is your little friend.

160
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,700
Oh, no!

161
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,460
This is a nightmare!

162
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,250
He is not here.

163
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,640
Bane will not be pleased
if we come back empty-handed.

164
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:13,220
If the gold one cannot provide
the information in his current state,

165
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,690
then I shall personally dismantle
every circuit in his plated little body

166
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,810
to get those answers!

167
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,900
That will destroy him.

168
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,170
Noble, yes. Wise? I think not.

169
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,740
Talk to me.

170
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,700
Connections complete.
Ready for download.

171
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,880
Your friend Goldenrod
turned out to be a huge waste of my time.

172
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,040
Something my clients don't have a lot of.

173
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,730
You know what's good for you,
you'll give me what I want.

174
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:33,010
I can't bear to watch.

175
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,780
Download that data
onto the memory drive.

176
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,820
I will deliver it immediately.

177
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,570
And prepare my ship.

178
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,370
What should we do with these two?

179
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,660
Wipe their memory
and dump them back in the street.

180
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,120
They'll find their way back home.

181
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,630
We can't have
anything looking out of place, can we?

182
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,030
It's so good to see you, Senator Aang.

183
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,190
How good it is to see you,
Senator Amidala.

184
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,980
Where can Threepio be?

185
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,320
I have no idea.

186
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,130
Thanks for the memories.

187
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,720
There you are!

188
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
I've been looking all over for you.

189
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,780
I'm certain we're late.
We'll be deactivated for sure.

190
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,810
As you requested,
the floor plans of the Senate.

191
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,480
I'll be needing my full payment now.

192
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,200
Something funny?

193
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,160
The almighty Jabba
requires further assistance.

194
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,370
You saying there's still more moves
to this dance?

195
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,630
Name your price.

196
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:18,230
I suppose I could rearrange
my busy schedule.

197
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,890
But I'll need details.

198
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,100
And an advance on my services
while we negotiate new terms.

199
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,980
And the advance?

200
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:41,910
First, the great Jabba
must receive the Council's approval.

201
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,990
The new assignment must be serious.

202
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,000
Jabba wants everyone out
except you, Cad Bane.

203
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,820
Well, well. If it isn't the heads
of the five Hutt families.

204
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:19,780
Droid,
my ancient Huttese is a little rusty.

205
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,360
Tell me what they say.

206
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:37,630
Jabba and Arok are debating
how important Ziro's release is.

207
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,850
Apparently, Ziro holds in his possession
some dangerous information.

208
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:50,730
Dangerous to the Hutt Council.

209
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,330
Oruba feels the Council will be safer
with Ziro under their protection.

210
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,260
They want to know who shall take on
this very dangerous task.

211
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,600
That would be me.

212
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,390
Cad Bane, at your service.

213
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:33,770
I'll take on any job

214
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,230
for the right price.

215
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,630
What are we going to do?

216
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,450
Artoo and C-3PO have not returned
with the jogan fruit for the cake.

217
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,040
I knew this was going to happen,
that's why I sent Artoo.

218
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:59,430
To the signing of the treaty.

219
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:03,720
And to my favorite dessert,
jogan fruitcake, yes.

220
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:12,140
Oh, no. I'm never going
to hear the end of this one.

221
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,310
Threepio, where were you?
You almost missed the whole party!

222
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,650
We encountered some complications, sir.

223
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,280
What kind of complications?

224
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,990
Actually, I have no recollection of my day.
I cannot really explain where I have been.

225
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,830
Thank you.

226
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:36,920
One, two, three, four.

227
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,816
You're going to have to do
better than that, Threepio,

228
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,260
because if Padmé's dinner is a disaster,

229
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,156
then you're not the only one
she's going to be mad at.

230
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,350
Anakin, stop worrying.
The cake is right here.

231
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,310
You should really lighten up on these two.

232
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,190
Threepio, you've done a magnificent job.

233
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh, my. A magnificent job?

234
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,820
A magnificent job! A magnificent job.
A magnificent job.

235
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,710
A magnificent job.

236
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,806
Well, we're gonna hear about this
one for a while, buddy.

237
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,200
A magnificent job!

238
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:19,380
A magnificent job. A magnificent job!

239
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,040
A magnificent job.
