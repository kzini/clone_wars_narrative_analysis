1
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,710
<i>Death and destruction!</i>

2
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,310
<i>Darth Maul and Savage Opress spread chaos</i>

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>as they descend on the outer rim.</i>

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,390
<i>After rescuing his brother from despair,</i>

5
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,170
<i>Savage and Maul murder
and pillage at every turn.</i>

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,540
<i>Fueled by rage and vengeance,</i>

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,980
<i>they search for meaning
in their new alliance</i>

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,196
<i>as reports of their brutal attacks</i>

9
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,830
<i>spread across the galaxy.</i>

10
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,530
Fan out.

11
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,700
I want a scan of the entire perimeter.

12
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:16,080
SD-357, have you found
anyone in the South passage?

13
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:21,630
357, where are you?

14
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,570
Intruders!

15
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,970
You are trespassing on intergalactic...

16
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,710
Look, brother, a fortune.

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,690
True fortune will be the demise of Kenobi.

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,130
Credit chips are meaningless
without a plan to survive.

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
The Jedi are hunting us.

20
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,540
We will be forced to make a stand.

21
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,220
And we will deal with them.

22
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,520
They are too many.

23
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,460
To continue, we need one singular vision...

24
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,290
my vision.

25
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,460
Brother, let us share our strength.

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,840
There is no need for dominance between us.

27
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,840
Always two there are, my brother,

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,880
a master and an apprentice,

29
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,080
and you are the apprentice.

30
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,200
So it is time for a lesson.

31
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,720
You have grown so powerful.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,960
And I shall complete your training.

33
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,460
Not as your brother

34
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,590
but as your master.

35
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,950
The distress signal is coming from here,

36
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,180
the Meridian sector,

37
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,720
Cybloc System.

38
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,320
It is close enough to the earlier attack.

39
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,860
I have a feeling it's them.

40
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,116
They ought to be flush.

41
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,440
Chips were all unlocked.

42
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,210
No way to trace 'em.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,840
All done by the two crabbiest Zabraks

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,580
this side of the Hydian.

45
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,580
They were alone?

46
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,690
Yup, yup.

47
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
What were they,

48
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,430
a couple of Jedi gone rogue or something?

49
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,040
They're not Jedi.

50
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,100
Do me a favor.

51
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,210
Spark up that lightsaber, would you?

52
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,370
Mm-hmm.

53
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:17,110
Well, the droids that got attacked

54
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,380
said that theirs were red.

55
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,290
They are Sith, and we need to find them

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,420
before they strike again.

57
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,660
Well, they took my cargo ship.

58
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,470
The droid survivor said
they heard something

59
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,900
about the Sertar sector.

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,270
What is in the Sertar sector?

61
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,940
That's where Florrum is.

62
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,140
You've been there?

63
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,610
What can we expect?

64
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,650
Pirates.

65
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,870
Get me a readout on that ship.

66
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,200
There are life-forms aboard.

67
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,000
The main reactor and
hyperdrive generator are down.

68
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,710
I think they're stranded.

69
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,540
And their communications?

70
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,220
Operational but silenced.

71
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,520
Mm.

72
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,320
We'll kill anyone on
board and take the ship.

73
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,290
Let's hope they have a wealth of cargo.

74
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,220
Pure sansanna spices.

75
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,460
Hondo will be pleased.

76
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,730
We drink tonight.

77
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,500
Now, find me those life-forms.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,140
Jedi.

79
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,390
Do you want to live?

80
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,550
Yes, very badly.

81
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,060
We will make you rich.

82
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,460
Your skills and talents
could serve us well.

83
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,030
The choice is yours.

84
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:30,300
Are you... are you hiring us?

85
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,710
What kind of Jedi are you?

86
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,210
We are not Jedi.

87
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,080
We are lords,

88
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,280
crime lords.

89
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,350
We work for Hondo.

90
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,020
You'll have to pay us really well

91
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,260
to get us to betray him.

92
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,760
Money is of no object for men like us.

93
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,336
You will have all that you desire and more

94
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,340
if you pledge yourselves to me.

95
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:00,070
All right.

96
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm tired of working for Hondo anyway.

97
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:05,510
I'll call up a couple of boys

98
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,480
and see if they'll join us.

99
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,720
I am certain captain Hondo
will never throw in with you.

100
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,720
Hondo's base will soon be ours,

101
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,066
and he will not survive this,

102
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,900
unless he embraces the
same choice I give you now.

103
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,870
Ha, I'm in.

104
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,200
So am I.

105
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,870
I am not sure.

106
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,340
Let's see what Hondo says about that.

107
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,650
<i>Three of your lieutenants</i>

108
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,090
<i>have already sworn allegiance to me.</i>

109
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:55,200
Traitors. Scum!

110
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm so proud...

111
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:01,680
but so betrayed.

112
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,680
There is a penalty for resistance.

113
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,230
<i>Let me warn you,</i>

114
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:20,200
<i>you are not the first
laser sword-wielding maniac</i>

115
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,370
<i>I've had to deal with,</i>

116
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:28,320
<i>and Hondo Ohnaka survives every time.</i>

117
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:30,750
We shall see.

118
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,680
We have a match on the cargo ship.

119
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,786
It seems Maul and Savage have
picked up a pirate escort.

120
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,880
Maybe to unload the stolen cargo.

121
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,450
I'm not sure the pirate
Hondo would have an alliance

122
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,860
with Maul and his brother.

123
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,960
So you know this Hondo personally?

124
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,036
Unfortunately, yes.

125
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,670
Oi, Hondo, there's a Jedi contacting you.

126
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,540
Says his name is Kenobi.

127
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,880
Kenobi?

128
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,180
Ha!

129
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,650
My, aren't we popular today?

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,350
Put him through. Go. Go. Go.

131
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,050
<i>Greetings, Hondo.</i>

132
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,420
Greetings?

133
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,930
What kind of menace have
you brought to my planet now?

134
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,200
First, you lose this system

135
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,770
and Grievous comes in

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,300
and destroys my entire stronghold,

137
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,210
leaving me here to just
rummage through the leftovers

138
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,610
of my once great empire.

139
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,950
And now these two horned men show up.

140
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,890
Who are these horny-headed maniacs?

141
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:49,400
They don't seem like normal Jedi.

142
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,070
<i>Not Jedi, Hondo, Sith.</i>

143
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,570
<i>We tracked them here.</i>

144
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,570
They just threatened to attack
with a group of my men...

145
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,140
my own men!

146
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,940
Yes, we are looking at them right now,

147
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,640
a cargo vessel and three of your starships.

148
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,580
They are heading toward you, Hondo.

149
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,260
<i>Dadada, more to the point,</i>

150
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,630
<i>are you going to help me when you get here?</i>

151
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,460
There's nothing we can do about your men,

152
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,436
but we can certainly do
something about the Sith.

153
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,100
<i>Good. I'll deal with my men.</i>

154
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,240
<i>You deal with those tattooed crazies.</i>

155
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,270
Right.

156
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,626
Well, that settles it.

157
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,090
Those traitors are no longer my men.

158
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,430
I want their tongues!

159
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,470
The Jedi, brother, they've found us.

160
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,970
No, it's too soon.

161
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,040
My plan isn't finished yet.

162
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Too soon.

163
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,550
Throwing in with pirates now?

164
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,560
Oh, how the mighty Sith have fallen.

165
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:20,950
Ah!

166
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,500
No.

167
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,470
I have plans, Kenobi,

168
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,370
and you will not stand in my way this time.

169
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
No!

170
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,510
Kenobi, this way!

171
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,250
Take this cannon down the hole.

172
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,610
We will ambush those traitors there.

173
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,370
Where are the rest of your men?

174
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,340
They are setting up an ambush.

175
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,080
We can use your help.

176
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,750
Where is the other Jedi?

177
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,350
She's... she's dead.

178
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,420
She's d...

179
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,566
They are too powerful for even you?

180
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:10,860
I am semi-speechless.

181
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,170
I think they went this way.

182
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,970
- I think they went this way.
- Let's go down this hall here.

183
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,470
I shall draw the brothers away.

184
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:18,480
Once that's done, blast
the passageway closed.

185
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:22,310
And leave you alone with the two crazies?

186
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,550
Well, okay.

187
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,830
Retreat! Retreat!

188
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,100
Do not let them escape!

189
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,920
Now!

190
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,430
Surrender.

191
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,410
We are two, and you are
no match for us both.

192
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
You are mistaken.

193
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,990
Are you still willing to fight me?

194
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,620
The horned men aren't
interested in helping you.

195
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,730
They are only interested in Kenobi.

196
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,820
They promised us wealth and power, boss.

197
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,490
Please forgive us.

198
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,020
Please don't kill us.

199
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,490
We beg of you.

200
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,720
Kill you?

201
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,100
Oh, I would not kill you.

202
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:03,600
Everyone, the horned men's ship
is filled with valuable goods.

203
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,110
As your restored leader,

204
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:09,256
I say we celebrate our reunification.

205
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,550
To the landing pad!

206
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,750
Right, Hondo, right!

207
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Savage!

208
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,640
Come, my apprentice.

209
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,450
This plan has failed,

210
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,310
but we will have another opportunity.

211
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,860
Jiro, ready the men! We're leaving.

212
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,700
My men aren't going anywhere with you.

213
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,110
Look at them.

214
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,880
How powerful can they be?

215
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,080
They are running away from Kenobi.

216
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,826
Filth, you'll pay for your insolence.

217
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:18,220
Insolence?

218
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,890
We are pirates!

219
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,000
We don't even know what that means.

220
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:23,970
Open fire!

221
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,770
If we kill those two,

222
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:29,510
their riches will be ours!

223
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,680
Our engines have been compromised.

224
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,450
Get to the escape pod.

225
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:34,060
It's too late.

226
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,190
Trust me, apprentice.

227
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,610
Well, Kenobi, let's get out there

228
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,480
and see what riches have fallen
from the sky for me... and you.

229
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,120
Shall we?

230
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,860
Very well.

231
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,120
There's no sign of those two, boss.

232
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,170
Well, if the condition of
these goods is any indication,

233
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,106
ah, your friends have been vaporized.

234
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,200
I wouldn't be so sure.

235
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,340
I cut one of them in half
once, and he survived.

236
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,540
Well, isn't that interesting?

237
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,820
I think we have closure on
this matter, master Kenobi.

238
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,820
I disagree, Chancellor.

239
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,320
Everything we've learned from this

240
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,150
is that the Sith are persistent.

241
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,990
They will not die.

242
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,090
I understand your
reservations, Master Kenobi,

243
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,236
but I am afraid we can no longer allow

244
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,860
this personal matter of yours
to be a Republic concern.

245
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,770
It does not appear this Darth Maul

246
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,070
is a direct threat to the Republic.

247
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:29,586
We need to redirect your
efforts to the cause at hand:

248
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,120
Stopping Count Dooku and
thus ending the Clone Wars.

249
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,566
Maul was trying to
build an army of pirates.

250
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,060
So let him.

251
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,160
Let him play with the rabble.

252
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
They're just petty crooks.

253
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,400
It is of no relevance to the senate

254
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,746
compared to the Separatist threat.

255
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:50,540
Good day, gentlemen.

256
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,580
Something is stirring in the underworld.

257
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,120
The crime families have
had too much free rein

258
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,960
since the Jedi have been
distracted by the clone war.

259
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,230
I fear it is a fertile
place for Maul to flourish,

260
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,030
if he has indeed survived.

261
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:09,860
Hmm, right you may be, Obi-Wan,

262
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,170
but heed the words of
the Chancellor we must.

263
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:15,950
A personal matter this is for you.

264
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,440
Clouded your judgment may be.

265
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,950
In time, if he lives,

266
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,780
reveal himself again Maul will.

267
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,850
And then swiftly we shall act.
