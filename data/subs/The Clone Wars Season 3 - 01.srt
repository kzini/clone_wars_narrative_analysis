1
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,240
Clone troopers unite!

2
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:21,750
As war rages across the galaxy,

3
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:24,410
the Republic's clone army
strives for victory

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,540
against the evil forces of the Separatists.

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,090
Bravery, valor, unity,

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,130
the lifeblood of victory on the battlefield
and in space.

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,470
It all begins on the planet Kamino,

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,300
where Jedi General Shaak Ti
oversees the training of clones

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:43,350
with the help of
contracted bounty hunters.

10
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,310
Bred to be perfect soldiers,
these cadets must first be subjected

11
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,150
to intense physical and mental training
before heading off to war.

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,040
You're clear! You're clear!

13
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,290
Cover fire!

14
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,010
This is Command. You must break
through enemy lines and take the tower.

15
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,901
- Comlink just relayed orders from...
- We all heard the orders, Echo!

16
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,020
- Stop calling me that.
- Stop repeating every order!

17
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,520
Less yapping, more blasting!

18
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,190
Let's smoke these chrome domes
and move on to the Citadel!

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,080
CT-782! You're breaking formation!

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,530
Just follow my lead, will you?

21
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,200
He's clearing a path. I'm moving.

22
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,710
Thanks, CT-27-5555. That was close.

23
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,380
It's "Fives"! The name is Fives!

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,230
Yeah, five pieces
if you don't keep your head down!

25
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,550
How about we follow orders?
This is our last practice test!

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,100
Will you shut up with instructions?
You're not in charge.

27
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:14,060
This particular unit
seems to have some trouble.

28
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,610
What do you recommend?

29
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,610
Well, I'm no Jedi, so forgive my bluntness,
but I say they fail.

30
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:25,410
Send them down to maintenance duty
with 99 and the other rejects.

31
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,500
We can't fail them yet.
Remember, this is only a practice test.

32
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,080
And besides, the Citadel course was
constructed to be a difficult challenge.

33
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:38,010
Although I don't agree with his sentiment,
Bric isn't wrong.

34
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,470
These cadets are far from ready.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,440
I can't hit anything from here.

36
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,850
No! We have to follow orders!

37
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,060
The one they call "Echo"
never adapts to the situation.

38
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,160
CT-782 seems to follow his own path.
He can't do it all alone.

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,620
You go, I'll cover you.

40
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,950
- I'm a better shot, you go.
- No, you go!

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,130
Look at those two.
Argue on the battlefield, you end up dead.

42
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,300
And the last one.

43
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,890
I surrender. I surrender!

44
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,810
Need I say more?

45
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,560
If these cadets can't get past
their shortsighted selfishness,

46
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,320
they will never come together.
Unity wins war, gentlemen.

47
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,860
Computer, end exercise for Domino Squad.

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,000
99, would you please send a cleaning crew
to the training ground?

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,240
Yes, mistress, we'll take care of the mess.

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,670
You should tell that 99 to drag away
the mess called Domino Squad.

51
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,390
We almost had it this time.

52
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,970
Yeah, and we all look nothing alike either.

53
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,140
Sorry about the mess, 99.

54
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,310
It's okay, boys. Nice try.

55
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,520
So I says to her,
"Baby, you and me could really..."

56
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,980
You've never even met a girl.

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,150
You know, you shouldn't worry
because most clones pass.

58
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,160
Yeah, but not all of us, right, shortie?

59
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,370
Guys, we've got to follow orders.
Come on!

60
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,920
I don't know. I think it went rather well.

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,460
Quit joking around.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,840
Can we please stop arguing?

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,930
Can you stop being droid bait out there?
You're getting in my way.

64
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,010
Actually, our way.

65
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,010
Well, you want to be the best,
then you got to think like it.

66
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,140
And I'm thinking like an ARC trooper.

67
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,730
ARC troopers follow orders.

68
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,020
Care to repeat that, Echo?

69
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,360
Come on, get him, Hevy!
Smack that know-it-all!

70
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,690
Cut it out!

71
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,070
If you two would focus on fighting droids
as much as you do fighting each other,

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,240
you might stand a chance out there.

73
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,990
Sorry, Master Chief.

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,580
Well, Master Chief,

75
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,080
maybe our problems
come from our training.

76
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:21,880
I'd rather be taught by a Jedi
than some mercenary bounty hunter.

77
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,710
Jedi don't have the time
to train grunts like you,

78
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,720
that's why they hired me.

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Listen, boys, when you were assigned
to me, I had high hopes for you.

80
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,730
Now we're approaching
the end of your training

81
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,610
and you haven't advanced nearly enough.

82
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:47,570
Even this bad batcher, 99,
has more sense than you guys do,

83
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,200
and he's a maintenance clone!

84
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,620
You... You don't give them enough credit.

85
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,700
You're all a waste of my time.

86
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:09,800
I understand your concerns, Master Jedi.

87
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,300
Ever since the unfortunate death
of Jango Fett,

88
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,430
we have had to stretch his DNA
to produce more clones.

89
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,980
A Jedi does not feel concern, Lama Su.

90
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,450
However, I have noticed
this unit of clones have been...

91
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,110
Deficient?

92
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,320
My only thought
is for you to search the galaxy

93
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,700
and find a suitable donor
for your future clones.

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,830
And what of the clones produced so far?

95
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,290
As you know,
there is no one way to make a clone.

96
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,630
Sometimes our efforts
are less than successful.

97
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,340
Are you suggesting
we just cast off the Domino Squad?

98
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,640
They're living beings, not objects.

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,070
You Jedi show too much compassion.

100
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:06,520
Nevertheless,
as General in charge of training,

101
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,860
the decision on what to do with them
would be yours, Master Jedi.

102
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,040
Gentlemen, who wants
to be an ARC Trooper?

103
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,340
- I do, sir!
- I do, sir!

104
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,800
You have to pass your final test first.

105
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,890
I want you to meet Commander Colt
of the rancor battalion.

106
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,890
I want you troopers to remember,

107
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,680
we're shoulder-to-shoulder
on those front lines. Brothers.

108
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,690
And sometimes we may quarrel,
but no matter what, we are united.

109
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,650
Rule one, we fight together.

110
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,860
So, who's ready to step up first?

111
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,370
Let's start with the unit
that ran the practice test in record time.

112
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,240
ARC trooper time.

113
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,250
Think he means us, boys?

114
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,910
Bravo Unit, step up.

115
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,880
Well, bravo for Bravo Squad.

116
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,420
Show an ARC trooper how it's done.

117
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,110
Come on, boys,
maybe we can learn something.

118
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,100
Shut up, Echo.

119
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,530
Start the Citadel challenge,
version THX, variable 1138.

120
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,290
Go right! Clankers!

121
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,680
We're better than these guys.

122
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,060
Okay, this is it. Go for it!

123
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,320
He's going to make it.

124
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,170
I'm impressed. You trained them well.
Who's next?

125
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,180
The Domino Squad.

126
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,050
And how are they?

127
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,280
- We can do this, guys.
- All we have to do is follow orders.

128
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:56,360
Check it out, guys.
Time to watch the Dominos fall.

129
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,450
- They are so much better than us.
- Knock it off.

130
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,410
Begin the program.
Let's not take it easy on them.

131
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,190
They're getting farther than normal.

132
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,760
Maybe so, but they're sloppy.

133
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,680
This is nothing.

134
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,150
Give them their next set of orders
and watch the chaos ensue.

135
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,390
I'm telling you,
these guys just aren't ready.

136
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,650
I flank left, you flank right!

137
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,610
Take it easy, I'm on your side.
Get it, your side, huh?

138
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,960
Pretty unorthodox.

139
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,910
Droid bait, behind you!

140
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,830
Man down!

141
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,300
Forget him! I'm breaking for the Citadel!

142
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,130
Hurry!

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,390
Guys, I think he's injured.

144
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,550
Leave him. Come on!

145
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,810
We're gonna pass this time.

146
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,650
Okay, I spoke too soon.

147
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,940
That would be putting it mildly.

148
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:25,700
Broke formation, disobeyed orders,
and you left a man behind.

149
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,240
You broke rule number one.

150
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,290
I'm sorry, Domino Squad.
This is an automatic failure.

151
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,460
I told you this was going to happen.

152
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,590
We've wasted enough time
on those losers.

153
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:42,550
Their failure is our failure.

154
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,300
I've made a request to General Shaak Ti

155
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:47,720
that the Domino Squad be allowed
to repeat the final test.

156
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,760
Why do you care about them?

157
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:53,480
- Why don't you?
- I care about getting paid.

158
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,900
It's a shame the bounty hunter in you
sees this only as a job.

159
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,320
More like an impossible task.

160
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,110
These cadets will be the finest troopers
we've trained. I have faith in them.

161
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,950
Faith? You can't be serious, El-Les.

162
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,510
We should treat them
as a special challenge, Bric.

163
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,830
We should treat them as failures.

164
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,630
Besides, I've already requested that they
be moved to clean up and maintenance.

165
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,670
That's all they're going to be good for.

166
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,130
Then I guess
the General has a decision to make.

167
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,020
General, may we have a word?

168
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,030
You are here to discuss your squad,
aren't you?

169
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,530
- How did you...
- Jedi, mate.

170
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,450
One doesn't need to be a Jedi
to feel the stress on your mind.

171
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,460
General, we would like to request
a transfer to another squad.

172
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,540
Bravo Squad, perhaps?

173
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,550
I am a Jedi, where the individual
and the group are one and the same,

174
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,470
much like you clones.

175
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:08,890
Which is why Fives and I
are looking out for each other.

176
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,850
As individuals. But not as a group.

177
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:15,020
You are where you need to be.

178
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Solve your problems as a whole,
not as individuals.

179
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,330
I have decided to allow you
and the rest of your squad

180
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,070
to take the test again tomorrow.

181
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,710
You wanted to see me, sir?

182
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,930
Near as I can tell,
you're the reason your squad's a failure.

183
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,980
Uh... Well, I'll take that as a compliment.

184
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,270
It's all a big joke to you, right?

185
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:00,690
Like those little nicknames you and
your clone brothers give each other.

186
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,070
I could think of one for you right now,
sir.

187
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,610
Oh... Funny!

188
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,120
But I think it's all just a cover.
You hate me, don't you?

189
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,620
Oh, no. No, no, no.
How could I hate you for doing your job?

190
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,760
- You're just pushing me, sir.
- No, this is me pushing you.

191
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,300
Come on, clone. Hit me. Hit me, you joker.

192
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,050
Can't take anything seriously, can you?
You're a real cutup, aren't you?

193
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,310
Come on!

194
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,470
- Thank you, sir.
- For what?

195
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,900
For my name. "Cutup."
I like the sound of it.

196
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,160
Out of my sight, cadet.

197
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,660
One way or another,
you'll be out of this army. Count on it.

198
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,180
Hevy, you going somewhere?

199
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,020
Get out of here.

200
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,980
You're going AWOL, aren't you?

201
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,520
Just go back to sleep, 99.
This doesn't concern you.

202
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,820
But you can't do this to your squad.

203
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,570
My squad?
We're nothing but a bad batch. Failures.

204
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,370
Like you.

205
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:43,250
Yeah, but how can I be a failure when I...
I never even got my chance?

206
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,340
It's a chance you're throwing away.

207
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,420
You're always trying to be the anchor,
Hevy, you know, do it on your own.

208
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:57,390
Well, maybe you should embrace the fact
that you have a team.

209
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,720
See, I never had that.

210
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:04,230
But you need them, and they need you.

211
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:07,560
Why carry such a heavy burden
on your own,

212
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,570
when you have your brothers
at your side, Hevy?

213
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,070
Hevy? Stop calling me that!
We're just numbers, 99. Just numbers.

214
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Not to me.
To me, you've always had a name.

215
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,630
Hey, where's CT-782?

216
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,720
Yeah, where is CT-782?

217
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,600
If he is not here, we will fail.

218
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,770
Not today, brothers.

219
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,560
Today, we pass.

220
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:52,280
And one more thing, the name's Hevy.

221
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,080
Orders came in clear, mates.

222
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,960
- Nothing to repeat, Echo?
- Not today.

223
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,090
- How's that shoulder treating you?
- I'll live.

224
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,130
We all know what we have to do.

225
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,830
That's it, boys, stay together.

226
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,280
Fives, on your left!

227
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,490
- Thanks, Cutup.
- No problem, brother.

228
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,790
- They seem to be working together.
- Still early. A lot can change.

229
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,140
Keep it up! We're doing great!

230
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,850
- We might actually pass!
- Not so fast, still got the Citadel!

231
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,080
All right. Prep the ascension cables.
Let's scale this thing.

232
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,420
Wait a tick. Where are the cables?

233
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,880
They're not on our belts!

234
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,710
Just when things seemed easy.

235
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,550
Well, we can't scale the face
without them!

236
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,380
We'll fail the test if we can't finish.

237
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,560
What's going on?
Where are their ascension cables?

238
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,760
Must have gotten lost.

239
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,390
What did you do?

240
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,600
I thought you had faith
they'd be the best, right?

241
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,730
Well, the best pass. No matter what.

242
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,070
General, you have to stop this.
This is unfair to the cadets.

243
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,360
Adversity in war is a constant, El-Les.

244
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,620
- But Bric has cheated.
- The enemy won't play fair either.

245
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:11,620
- So, this is it?
- No, not exactly. Those guns up there.

246
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,290
We can use them
as a step to the next level.

247
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,800
Form a chain
and use each other to scale this face.

248
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,090
- Use the guns? Are you crazy?
- Trust me. I know weapons.

249
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm gonna draw their fire,
you guys blast them.

250
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,250
Well, I'll be...
Creative little clones, aren't they?

251
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,790
No unit has shown such ingenuity.

252
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,670
- We did it!
- Yeah!

253
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,310
- I knew we could do it, boys!
- We made it!

254
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,180
Bric, your actions have brought out
the best in these cadets.

255
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,980
Looks like they were well-trained.
Perhaps the finest soldiers I've ever seen.

256
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,280
Well, maybe you were right, El-Les.

257
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,240
Congratulations, you've graduated.
At ease.

258
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,410
Next stop, ARC trooper!

259
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,830
Yeah, how about
we face some combat first?

260
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,210
You were right, you know.
About everything.

261
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,930
I heard
you were quite the leader out there.

262
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,340
No leaders. We are a team.

263
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,590
All of us, 99.

264
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,590
The army's lucky
to have a clone like you, Hevy.

265
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:53,020
Not as lucky as I am
to have a brother like you.

266
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,700
Well, this is goodbye, I guess.

267
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,730
Hevy ships out and 99 stays here.

268
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,610
We'll see each other again.

269
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,530
I mean, how else am I supposed
to get this back from you?

270
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,200
You deserve it. You're one of us.

271
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,220
Today is your graduation.

272
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,920
From here, you ship out
to fight against the Separatists

273
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,390
and restore peace to the Republic.

274
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:35,100
Congratulations! You are no longer cadets.
You are troopers.

275
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,600
May the Force be with you.

276
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,400
Attention!

277
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,400
Helmets on!
