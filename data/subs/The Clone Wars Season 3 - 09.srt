1
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,870
A great escape!

2
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,160
Cad Bane and his notorious crew
of bounty hunters

3
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,960
liberated Ziro the Hutt
from a Republic prison

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,460
after holding the Galactic Senate hostage.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,460
The Jedi Council has assigned
Obi-Wan Kenobi to retrieve Ziro the Hutt

6
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,970
with the help of Jedi Knight Quinlan Vos.

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,640
Unknown to the Jedi, we find Ziro
in the clutches of the five Hutt families

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,310
on the distant world of Nal Hutta.

9
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,150
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
I see no need for resentment

10
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,230
in light of this joyous occasion
of my freedom.

11
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,040
Of course I do appreciate
the help in my escape.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,840
I have no illusions
about the fact that my escape

13
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,220
was a result of the highly sensitive
knowledge that I possess.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,220
A holo-diary cataloguing
the nefarious deeds of this council.

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,230
Kill me and the diary will show up
on the step of the Senate.

16
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,650
The cold, hard reality is

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,030
that as long as I control
this highly sensitive material,

18
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,700
my memory will only get duller.

19
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,540
Yes, take me to my room!

20
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,250
I only hope
the accommodations are satisfactory.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,300
Ah...

22
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,390
Sir, you seem troubled.

23
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,850
Quinlan Vos has that effect.

24
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,770
Ah... Yes,
that Jedi has quite a reputation.

25
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,900
That may be overstating it, Cody.
Let's just say he's crazy.

26
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,110
Ship entry from the west, sir.

27
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,530
Hey, Kenobi!

28
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,920
Hey, Commander, looking good.

29
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,420
Kenobi, you look worse for wear.
How's Temple life?

30
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,470
Good seeing you, too.

31
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,930
Yes, well, if you could tell time
half as well as you can stick a landing,

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,820
we wouldn't be behind schedule now,
would we?

33
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,560
Well, that's your opinion, man.

34
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,770
Let's get down to business.

35
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,690
Ziro the Hutt was broken out
during a hostage takeover.

36
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,020
Yeah, I read the briefing about that mess.

37
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:59,280
I suspect Jabba the Hutt is behind this.

38
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,240
He still has it out for Ziro
over the kidnapping of his son.

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,030
Well, my information indicates that
Ziro has damaging evidence

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,450
against the Hutt Council.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,880
My guess is they've taken him
to the Hutt home planet, Nal Hutta.

42
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,790
As for this bounty hunter, Cad Bane,
we must capture and return both

43
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,050
he and his quarry, Ziro, to the courts.

44
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,230
I trust you and I can keep eyes forward
in this common goal?

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:26,090
No problem. I owe Bane one anyway.
I'll fly, you're my co-pilot.

46
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,140
I was afraid he'd say that.

47
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,070
Sounds like that rough crowd out there
is an easy one tonight.

48
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,500
All in a night's work, baby.

49
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,240
Course, having Ziro locked up
in the detention cell block

50
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,450
probably isn't hurting their mood.

51
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,040
Ziro's here? If you'll excuse me,
I need to step outside.

52
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,290
Gardulla has a request.

53
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,130
She wants to know
which one of you is stronger.

54
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,690
Stop them, they're fighting!

55
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,940
Ziro, honey, my true love,
what happened to you?

56
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,150
I thought you were coming back for me.
I waited so long.

57
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,950
I thought you didn't love me anymore.

58
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,250
Our separation last time was a bit abrupt,
and I do blame Jabba for that.

59
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,870
Jabba?

60
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,460
He forced me to have you sent away
from Coruscant,

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,840
shattering the serenity
of the happiest time of my life.

62
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,590
Ziro, honey,

63
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:15,020
being with you
was the happiest time of my life, too.

64
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,470
And now, hearing you say that

65
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,400
makes me the luckiest little Pa'lowick
the galaxy has ever known.

66
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,530
Unfortunately, the cage
that entraps me now

67
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,910
also entraps the chance
of loving you again.

68
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,830
What do they want with you?
Why would they do this?

69
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,760
As hard as it is
to confess this to you, Snooty,

70
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,210
I'm not a perfect Hutt.

71
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,550
I don't care what you've done
or why they want to hurt you.

72
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,010
I only care about us being together,
forever.

73
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,930
You... You really mean that?

74
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,390
From the bottom of my fluid sack.

75
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,190
Unfortunately, my love,
there's no way for us to be together

76
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,620
as long as I'm in this dreadful cell.

77
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,320
With true love, there's always a way.

78
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,660
How goes the war, gentlemen?

79
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,160
Great Gardulla,
we bring unfortunate news.

80
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
Ziro the Hutt has escaped our custody

81
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,750
with the aid
of the bounty hunter Cad Bane.

82
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:11,390
The great Gardulla already knows this,
Jedi Knights.

83
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,010
I'm beginning to think
you're the ones who broke him out.

84
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,140
And why would the great Hutt families
do such a thing?

85
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,840
That's what I'd like to know.

86
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,480
Quinlan, the Hutts are our allies.

87
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,620
Mighty Gardulla says, you are lucky
to be with a Jedi as wise as Kenobi,

88
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,490
or you might not be allowed
to leave here alive.

89
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,460
In light of this joyous occasion
of my...

90
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,960
Maybe next time I'll come alone, hmm?

91
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,840
We only came to deliver the message.
We shall be leaving now.

92
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,970
Ziro was here.

93
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,810
He was holding one of those cups.

94
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,100
Nice work.

95
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,870
Vos, Ziro escaped.

96
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,210
- I think he had help.
- We best hurry.

97
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,680
I disagree.

98
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,690
The Jedi aren't the ones
that broke Ziro out of jail.

99
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,400
He was gone way before they arrived.

100
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,400
It looks like we're right back
where we started.

101
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,990
I'm kind of tired of being paid
for this job, too, but not that tired.

102
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,580
If you Hutts ain't interested
in knowing who's behind this

103
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,080
and making it go away,

104
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,540
I can take a hint.

105
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,380
So, we doing business or not?

106
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,610
I understand your tracking talent,
but why wouldn't Ziro leave the planet?

107
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,730
Why not just fly away?

108
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:37,610
My senses tell me that he's still here.

109
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,490
It's illogical.

110
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,570
He knows he's being looked for here.

111
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,990
Something is keeping him here.

112
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,660
If we'd brought a droid,
this would go faster.

113
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,610
Are you finished messing around?
We're trying to catch Ziro, remember?

114
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,520
Which way have they gone?

115
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:16,440
Well, since you're suddenly
so interested in my tracking abilities,

116
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,190
they went this way.

117
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,280
I never doubted you.

118
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,970
Why are we stopping here?

119
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,470
I guarantee Gardulla
is searching for us as we speak,

120
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,980
so I came to the one place
she would never, ever show up.

121
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,320
Hello there!

122
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,490
Son! Who invited you?

123
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,380
Mama!

124
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,080
Should've figured
after all these years of never calling,

125
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,370
you'd show up at dinner time.

126
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,920
You gonna sit in your stink,

127
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,590
or you gonna pass the slime pods?

128
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,260
Never would've had to tell that
to your brother Ebor,

129
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,970
rest his soul.

130
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,560
So, Sonny, what the heck you been doing
the past few years anyway?

131
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:40,980
A smidgen of this and a pinch of that.

132
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,490
Using all of my facilities
for the betterment of my fellow Hutts.

133
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,950
What is it you want, Sonny?

134
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:53,500
Can't a loving son just want to
visit his mother on occasion?

135
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,660
When plebos fly out of my hump!

136
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,540
Well, now that you mention it,

137
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:04,380
I wouldn't mind swapping
my swamp speeder for your starship.

138
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:07,380
That's what I thought.
Who's chasing you this time?

139
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,510
Gardulla.

140
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,260
Oh...

141
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,060
Take it! Just make sure
you bring it back full power.

142
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,190
Thanks, Mama.

143
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,310
I've got some important business on Teth.

144
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,400
Todo, how far ahead are the Jedi?

145
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,990
I don't know.

146
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,490
This is the last time
I take one of these jobs.

147
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,520
Looks as though
we're not the only ones after Ziro.

148
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,390
We must be cautious.

149
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,810
Vos! Somebody lives here.

150
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,490
Smells like somebody died here.

151
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,620
Break in my house, will you, smart guy?

152
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,120
Thousand pardons, madam.

153
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,830
He hasn't mastered the concept
of knocking, for that I apologize.

154
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,920
I got trouble for you, too,
mister fancy pants.

155
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,460
No need. We're not here to harm you.

156
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,130
That'll be a first for tonight.

157
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,510
Meaning?

158
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:39,020
Meaning, first, my deadbeat son
and his limp-lipped girlfriend come in

159
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,150
and sponge me out of my starship.

160
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,320
Then some slime sap and his droid
charge in

161
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:52,370
and force me to give up the skinny
on where Ziro's headed.

162
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,780
Big hat?

163
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, Chad-something out for blood.

164
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,870
You wanna kill my little boy, too?

165
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,830
No, madam,
but if we don't find him before Bane does,

166
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,000
your son will not be so lucky.

167
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,340
Teth. Ziro's heading for Teth.

168
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,010
We need to get to that jungle planet.
We need to get there fast.

169
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,970
Hey! Who's gonna pay for my door?

170
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,360
Are we close to your holo-diary, baby?

171
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,000
This way.

172
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,490
My papa's grave.

173
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,720
I never did have the heart to tell Mama
that Papa ran away, or that he died.

174
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,340
Some people are just happier
when they're miserable.

175
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,100
The Hutt Council records.

176
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,560
Every dirty deed
those criminals have slithered through.

177
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,230
Worth a fortune, baby,
plenty enough to retire on.

178
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:14,070
That's too bad. I still got work to do.

179
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,820
But... What about Solarine?

180
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,370
The sunsets, you and me sharing a future?

181
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:28,510
Next time, you'll think twice
about breaking someone's heart.

182
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,920
Oh, wait. There won't be a next time.

183
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,950
I just hate it when someone does my job.

184
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:03,120
And the holo-diary is gone as well!

185
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,460
Drat!

186
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,290
Jedi.

187
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,850
Who could have done this?

188
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,820
Bane!

189
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,780
Looks like we're both too late
for the party.

190
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,820
So this is not your handiwork?

191
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,700
No.
I wouldn't have made such a sloppy kill.

192
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:45,160
Doesn't seem like much sense
hanging around here,

193
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,790
or making any trouble between us.

194
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,500
Are you forgetting how you held
the Senate hostage?

195
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,840
I may not be capturing Ziro,
but you are going to prison.

196
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,170
Well, now that you mention it,

197
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:02,180
the Separatists are paying
a million credits a head for a Jedi.

198
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,820
I never did enjoy hanging out with you.

199
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,250
Jabba thanks you
for delivering the holo-diary.

200
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:41,420
No one would suspect
that a lovely creature such as myself

201
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:44,350
could do a bounty hunter's work.
