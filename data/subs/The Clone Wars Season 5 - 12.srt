1
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,160
<i>Stranded!</i>

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,170
<i>On a secret mission for the Republic,</i>

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,030
<i>Colonel Gascon
and his intrepid droid squad</i>

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,176
<i>successfully steal an encryption module</i>

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,930
<i>from a Separatist ship.</i>

6
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,300
<i>During their escape, our heroes crash</i>

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,370
<i>on the Outer Rim planet of Abafar</i>

8
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>and find themselves stranded
in the strange wasteland</i>

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
<i>called The Void.</i>

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,410
<i>Now, after surviving against all odds,</i>

11
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,720
<i>our heroes must find a way home</i>

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,450
<i>and deliver the encryption module</i>

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,250
<i>to crack the Separatist code
and stop an enemy attack.</i>

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,590
I have never been to Tatooine,

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,860
but if this place
reminds you of it, R2,

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,110
remind me never to go there.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,070
Don't be absurd, QT.

18
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,100
These people aren't dangerous.

19
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,880
Most of these people are probably hiding

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,590
from someone or something.

21
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,650
That's the way it is
on these Outer Rim armpits.

22
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,390
Nobody's here by choice,

23
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,250
which goes double for me.

24
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,650
I hope you have a plan

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,160
to get us off this armpit, Colonel.

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,590
Of course I do, Corporal.

27
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,260
All we need is a communications uplink

28
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
and some fuel.

29
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,060
Thank you for the reminder, C4,

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,470
but I'm well aware our shuttle's
lost in The Void.

31
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm talking about fuel for me.

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,070
You droids can putter along
on battery power

33
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,610
but I need food to survive.

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,410
My power cells are running low, too,

35
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,710
and an oil bath would be nice.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,220
All this dust is wreaking havoc
on my joints.

37
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,590
Forget it, BZ.

38
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,550
We're not on vacation here.

39
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,560
R2, is the encryption module safe?

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,860
Nothing short of death or dismemberment

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,060
will stop Colonel Meebur Gascon

42
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,230
from delivering
that module to Coruscant.

43
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,310
Well, I'll be.

44
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,810
A diner. A place of eating.

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,920
I'm saved.

46
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,680
R2, you and the other 'mechs
scout the perimeter.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,730
Find out if there
are any unfriendlies around.

48
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:40,060
Corporal, you and I will refuel
in this fine establishment.

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,170
Good day.

50
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,380
I am Colonel Gascon of
the Grand Army of the Republic.

51
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,350
And I am here
on very important business.

52
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,460
I don't have much time,
so if you'll be so kind

53
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,560
as to fix me your daily special
and let my droid recharge.

54
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,170
No droids.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,600
Fine.

56
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,000
Wait for me outside, Corporal.

57
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,040
We don't serve your type either.

58
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:35,110
What type are you referring to?

59
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,080
Conduit worms.

60
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,750
I beg your pardon.
I am a Zilkan.

61
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,590
You'll be begging for your life

62
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,390
if you don't beat it.

63
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,890
Beat it.

64
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,906
Uh-oh.

65
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,930
Ah!

66
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,830
Oh, ah!

67
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,230
This is an outrage.

68
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,670
That monstrosity will rue the day

69
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,670
he denied me a meal.

70
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,740
I would not push it, Colonel.

71
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,686
That monstrosity
might make a meal out of you.

72
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,040
I don't care.

73
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,650
I'm famished.

74
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,020
I think I can help.

75
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,240
Your meal awaits you, sir.

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,170
You short-circuiting
hydrospanner,

77
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,510
that's no meal.

78
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:43,510
That is garbage.

79
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,850
What is the difference?

80
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,340
It is edible, is it not?

81
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,470
Agh!

82
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

83
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,980
I didn't see you there.

84
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,680
Look, I could get you some food,

85
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,810
but normally people
come in the front door.

86
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,950
But there's no problem.

87
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,250
You do know that
you're eating garbage, right?

88
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,230
You're a clone.

89
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,560
Excuse me?

90
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,606
Uh, I...

91
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,676
I wouldn't know about that.

92
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,330
My... my name's Gregor.

93
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,870
Uh, wait, what's a clone?

94
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,170
You are a clone.

95
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,840
Are you working undercover?

96
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,810
I don't know what you're talking about.

97
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,350
Listen to me, soldier,
whatever your assignment is,

98
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
it can't be more important than mine.

99
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,150
It is his first real mission.

100
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,826
He is just a map reader.

101
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,350
Don't listen to that ignoramus.

102
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,990
You are a clone and a soldier
in the Republic Army,

103
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,630
and I order you to take me to your ship.

104
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,330
We need to get back to Coruscant
immediately.

105
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,300
Uh, look, friend,
I was just trying to help.

106
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,330
I'm sorry if you took it the wrong way.

107
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,670
I do not think that soldier

108
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,270
believes you are a colonel, uh, Colonel.

109
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,610
Gregor!

110
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,870
Get back to work.

111
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,180
Uh, excuse me. I got to go.

112
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,450
I don't wanna lose my job.

113
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,720
But I'm still hungry.

114
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,730
Well, what's the scouting report?

115
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,930
Separatist droids?

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,570
Hmm, well, that complicates matters.

117
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,750
So, uh, boss,

118
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,480
you know, I was just wondering...

119
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:14,580
No, you can't have a raise, Gregor.

120
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,720
Oh, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,750
I don't want a raise, sir.

122
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,620
I-I just wanted to know,
what's a clone?

123
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,400
Someone told me I was a clone today.

124
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,500
They insisted.

125
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,690
Heh. A clone?

126
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,130
Clones fight battles across the galaxy.

127
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,306
They are brave soldiers.

128
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,670
Does that sound like you?

129
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,170
You're a dishwasher, Gregor.

130
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,880
Forget about clones
or anything like that.

131
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,070
You have good life here,

132
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,980
a simple life.

133
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,540
More than you had when Borkus found you.

134
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,850
I know, sir.

135
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,256
And I appreciate everything
that you've done.

136
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,257
Believe me.

137
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:55,520
But I thought maybe you could...

138
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,920
could you tell me, how did I get here?

139
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,090
Where did you find me?

140
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,490
Enough questions.

141
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Go home. Sleep.

142
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:05,120
Come back tomorrow. Do your job.

143
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,430
And I don't ever want to hear
that word "clone" again,

144
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,860
understand?

145
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,280
I cannot help noticing

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,100
that we are already on our third plan.

147
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,510
Smart battle strategy requires
flexibility and improvisation,

148
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,580
something droids are not known for.

149
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,120
R2 is right.

150
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,590
Droids are not known for being flexible,

151
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,590
because we are programmed
to be right the first time.

152
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,660
Well, answer me this, Corporal,

153
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,490
if the Jedi Council
thought one of you droids

154
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,900
were better prepared
to lead this mission,

155
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,600
then why did they put me in charge?

156
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,530
'Cause you were the only one
who could fit inside BZ.

157
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
No, it is because my power
of deduction told me

158
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,520
that if there
are Separatist droids on Abafar,

159
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,256
then there must be a landing zone nearby

160
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,080
where there will be no doubt
a shuttle to take us home.

161
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,450
That, Corporal, is why <i>I</i> am in charge.

162
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,690
Now, we are going
to waltz down there, undetected,

163
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,700
just like we did on the dreadnought,

164
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,100
and commandeer that shuttle
without incident.

165
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,930
The mechs have a point, Colonel.

166
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,570
After what we did on the dreadnought,

167
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,710
those battle droids probably
have our identities scanned.

168
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,540
We will have to fight our way
onto the shuttle this time.

169
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,216
Hmm, you droids may have a point.

170
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,940
But there's no way in Malachor

171
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,810
that I'm going to lead
this pitiful squad

172
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,410
on an assault of that landing zone.

173
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,020
What is the plan now, Colonel?

174
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,090
We're going to wait
until our clone gets off work,

175
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,120
then enlist his help,
whether he wants to or not.

176
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,340
Captain Rex reporting for duty.

177
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,770
Agh! What?

178
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,750
I...

179
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,310
I don't understand.

180
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,580
That's me?

181
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,680
No, that's Captain Rex.

182
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,350
He's a clone in the Republic Army,

183
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,520
just like you, Gregor.

184
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,220
I can't believe it.

185
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,860
Okay, slow down. Slow down.

186
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:21,430
So you're telling me that there
are more of these clones?

187
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,376
Millions. A whole army's worth.

188
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,100
Uh-huh.

189
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,440
And they all look exactly like me?

190
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,940
No, those clones are warriors,

191
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,986
professional soldiers
created by the Republic,

192
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,250
trained to fight, and die if necessary,

193
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
in our war against the Separatists.

194
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,050
They're not dishwashers

195
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,450
living in
some vermin-infested hovel.

196
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,390
Look, I'm lucky to live in this place.

197
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,436
Mr. Borkus says my salary
doesn't even cover the rent,

198
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,330
so he pays the difference for me.

199
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,030
Don't you get it, Gregor?

200
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,540
You're his slave.

201
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:01,730
We need to figure out
who you really are,

202
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,330
how you got here.

203
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,440
Are you sure
you don't remember anything?

204
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:12,540
Well, all I remember is
waking up on a transport.

205
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,750
Somehow we crashed on Abafar.

206
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,020
And, well, Mr. Borkus says
I have amnesia.

207
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,280
Hmm.

208
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,820
Every clone has an
identifying code on their wrist.

209
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,496
Your military records
will be in the database.

210
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,920
Scan him, R2.

211
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,100
Impressive.

212
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,816
Gregor, your designation
is CC-5576-39.

213
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,340
You were a captain
and part of an elite squad.

214
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,650
A clone commando.

215
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,320
Your file says you were reported

216
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:55,850
missing in action during

217
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,690
the Battle of Sarrish.

218
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,490
Sarrish?

219
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,490
Sarrish.

220
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,590
Wait.

221
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,830
What was the Battle of Sarrish?

222
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,740
It was one of the Republic's
most devastating losses.

223
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,100
Sarrish.

224
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,770
Yes.

225
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:17,780
Yes, I remember now.

226
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,240
So many soldiers were dying.

227
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,650
Do... do you remember
how you escaped Sarrish?

228
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,750
No.

229
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:31,050
I just remember seeing all those bodies.

230
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,550
Bodies everywhere.

231
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,460
I knew I had to get help.

232
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,660
But that's where the memory stops.

233
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
Well, soldier,

234
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:43,300
there's nothing you can do
about that battle now,

235
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,430
but you can help us.

236
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,400
Our mission depends on it.

237
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,840
Uh, Colonel, Gregor said
to give him five minutes,

238
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,580
but it has been six.

239
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,890
What if he does not accept
your offer to join us?

240
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,380
Then I'll go back in there

241
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,090
and personally
knock some sense into him.

242
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,097
That won't be necessary.

243
00:14:07,121 --> 00:14:08,290
Whoa!

244
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:11,666
I figured
at least looking like a soldier

245
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,760
might bring back some more memories,

246
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,970
until we recover my equipment anyway.

247
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,160
I overheard you guys talking.

248
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,430
I think I know where my armor is.

249
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,870
Let's go check out the diner.

250
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,910
Step it up, soldiers.
This isn't a party.

251
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,880
We do not have all night.

252
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,780
Looking for this?

253
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,590
My uniform. My equipment.

254
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,660
All this time you knew who I was
and didn't tell me.

255
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,677
Why?

256
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:56,830
I don't care who you were.

257
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,730
You are dishwasher now.

258
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,840
And you owe me for saving you
from your crash.

259
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,440
Your life is mine, Gregor.

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,210
You didn't save me.

261
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
You turned me into a slave.

262
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,750
I've worked in this dump
taking orders from you

263
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,696
when I could have been fighting
for the Republic.

264
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,280
I want my life back.

265
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,650
You want your freedom, Gregor?

266
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,920
Take your gun from me.

267
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,290
Show me you are a soldier.

268
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,790
You see?

269
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,090
You are no soldier.

270
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,200
You are a dishwasher.

271
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,610
Why, you no-good droids.

272
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,840
Let go of me.

273
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,110
Agh! Oh.

274
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,580
Agh!

275
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:49,580
Take your things, Gregor.

276
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,990
We're getting out of here.

277
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,390
Don't leave, Gregor.

278
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,690
It's a big galaxy out there,

279
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,190
bigger than you know.

280
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:02,200
Stay here, where your life is simple.

281
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,800
Simple isn't good enough anymore.

282
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,460
Not for this clone.

283
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,477
Ha!

284
00:16:07,501 --> 00:16:10,030
You will never get off Abafar,

285
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,440
you and your little Republic friends,

286
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,810
not after your Jedi cruiser blows up.

287
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,980
What are you talking about?

288
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,280
Why do you think the
Separatists bother coming here?

289
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,280
They are mining our rhydonium

290
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,550
to load on the shuttle
and destroy your ride home.

291
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,796
You will see.

292
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:35,190
You will all be stuck here

293
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,970
begging Borkus for a job in his diner.

294
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,020
Okay, let's see what we're up against.

295
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,090
Gregor.

296
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,866
Wait. There.

297
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,090
There's a cruiser up there.

298
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:15,730
And that shuttle, I think...

299
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,560
Yes, it's being loaded up
with rhydonium canisters.

300
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:22,947
Huh.

301
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:24,100
I guess Mr. Borkus

302
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,740
was actually telling
the truth... for once.

303
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,040
What exactly is rhydonium?

304
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,470
It's a fuel.

305
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,740
Mostly been mined out on Abafar.

306
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,450
It's volatile and dangerous.

307
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:39,450
Yes, we do have a new mission:

308
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:43,180
Stop the Separatists
from blowing up that cruiser.

309
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,956
I'll cover you
and clear the way, Colonel.

310
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,480
You all head straight to the shuttle.

311
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,280
I'll take care of those clankers.

312
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,990
Hmm, sounds like a good plan.

313
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,720
You soldiers ready to get dangerous?

314
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,490
I'll meet you at the shuttle, sir.

315
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,460
Let's roll.

316
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,570
Hey!

317
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,480
You need authorization
to enter this area.

318
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,510
Agh!

319
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
Get them!

320
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,810
Agh!

321
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,360
Good job, Gregor.

322
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,610
Look, he's up there!

323
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,400
Just keep moving.

324
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,670
It is all under control.

325
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,310
I'm beginning to remember
how much I hate these guys.

326
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,550
Hey, I don't recognize those astromechs.

327
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,690
Blast them!

328
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,090
They are on to us.

329
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,070
Colonel, can you hear me?

330
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,230
Save yourselves!

331
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,060
Okay. Whoa!

332
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,077
Agh!

333
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:32,660
Whoa-oh-oh.

334
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,170
Did everybody make it?

335
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,710
No, BZ and the colonel
are still out there.

336
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,060
Get the shuttle ready to roll.

337
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,430
Agh!

338
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,420
Colonel, you all right?

339
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,990
I'll never make it back alive.

340
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,436
Yes, you will, sir.

341
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,960
This is what I was born to do.

342
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,740
Now, go before it's too late.

343
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,410
It's been an honor
serving with you, Colonel.

344
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,596
R2's right.

345
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,790
We can swing back around
and pick you up.

346
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,490
Don't worry about me.

347
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,420
You made me remember who I am.

348
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,260
I'll make my way home.
I promise.

349
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,440
Now go!

350
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,830
Where is Gregor?

351
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,830
Where is Gregor?

352
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,700
He's doing what a soldier does:

353
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,340
Sacrificing himself
for the lives of others.

354
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,830
You will be remembered, Captain Gregor.

355
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,700
We'll take your heroic story
back to the Republic,

356
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,770
and we will watch for your return.
