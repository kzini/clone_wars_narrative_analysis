1
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,900
<i>Secret weapons!</i>

2
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,510
<i>The Jedi Council deploys
a squad of droids</i>

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,610
<i>on a desperate mission
aboard a Separatist cruiser.</i>

4
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,920
<i>Under the guidance
of Colonel Meebur Gascon,</i>

5
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,050
<i>the droids succeed in stealing
a crucial encryption module.</i>

6
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,320
<i>Now the colonel and his droid squad</i>

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,030
<i>must return the module
to the Jedi Temple</i>

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>to crack a Separatist code</i>

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,730
<i>detailing an impending terror
plot against the Republic.</i>

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:49,040
How long until my command
center is operational again?

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,950
Okay, fine.

12
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:58,590
I meant how long until Beezee
is operational again?

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,730
Well, make it fast.

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,760
We must get this encryption
module back to the Republic

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,600
as soon as possible.

16
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,320
Uh-oh.

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,070
Oh, Beezee, you are all better.

18
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,646
WAC, what are you doing back here?

19
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,270
Who is flying this shuttle?

20
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,640
I have good news and bad news, Colonel.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,710
The bad news is, scans are
picking up giant ice formations,

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,620
commonly called comets,
heading straight for us.

23
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,720
What? Wha...

24
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,190
What in the world is the good news?

25
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,790
At least you have a good excuse

26
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,930
if your mission is a failure.

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,800
Get out of my...

28
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,650
Quick, drop us out of hyperspace.

29
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,560
Whoa!

30
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,770
Look out!

31
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,320
Whoa!

32
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,430
The shuttle's power system
has been knocked out.

33
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,360
I can see that.

34
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,570
He says he can fix it.

35
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,600
And swinging right.

36
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,450
Auxiliary power has been restored,

37
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,250
but it is not enough to get us moving.

38
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:29,190
We need the primary motivators
reestablished now.

39
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,230
Forget that.

40
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,700
We need the engines to come on.

41
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,800
That's what I'm saying.

42
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,590
Uh-oh. They just got bigger.

43
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,590
Come on, you lousy mechs.

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Uh, Colonel,
we are headed for that comet.

45
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,630
Brace yourself!

46
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:06,810
The engines are back online!

47
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,870
Ah!

48
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,820
Whoa! Whoa!

49
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,560
Whoa!

50
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,860
We have lost the stabilizers

51
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,830
and primary control of the engines.

52
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,010
We are going to have
to put her down on that planet.

53
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,910
What planet is it?

54
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,420
Is it Separatist-controlled?

55
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,427
Who cares?

56
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:24,520
I care.

57
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,620
We can't jeopardize the mission.

58
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,090
I think we are past that point, sir.

59
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,030
We're going down!

60
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,380
Ugh. Oh.

61
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,420
I think I ruptured my gizzard.

62
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,800
Well, this is a fine mess
you mechs got us into.

63
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,746
Look at this.

64
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,340
All the database says is,

65
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:57,880
"Abafar. Information void."

66
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,020
Don't be absurd.

67
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:03,290
We can't just go rushing off like fools

68
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,990
into this... this void.

69
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,500
We need to stay put,
consider all the facts,

70
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,430
and then I'll, uh... I'll draw up
a reconnaissance plan,

71
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,400
and we can... hey, hey!

72
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,370
Where are you going, soldier?

73
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
He says we have to finish our mission.

74
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,680
Hey! Where did you get that?

75
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,960
That is classified material.

76
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,060
I will not stand for insubordination.

77
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,360
Do not worry, Colonel.

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,130
I can lead the mission from here

79
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,740
and return the module.

80
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,970
Maybe they'll give <i>me</i> a promotion.

81
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,410
Over my dead body.

82
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,450
Beezee, pop your top.

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,020
I will not let you droids
commandeer my mission.

84
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:21,990
Ugh, so hot.

85
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,370
Ugh, I can't believe I came this close

86
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,540
to completing my first mission

87
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,440
only to get lost
in this detestable desert.

88
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,210
Look on the bright side, Colonel.

89
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,380
At least it is a sunny day.

90
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,390
What sun? I don't see any sun.

91
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,790
It's just hot and oppressive.

92
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,960
Wait a minute.

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
There's no sun.

94
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,900
How do we know
which direction we're going?

95
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,340
You set your directional
guidance to "straight"?

96
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,980
That's all we're going on,

97
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,810
some rudimentary programming directive

98
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,150
in a lousy astromech?

99
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,390
Yes, I know you're designed
for navigation,

100
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,430
but that requires map coordinates

101
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,230
and environmental input...

102
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:16,300
something we are sorely lacking here.

103
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,510
All right, we can't rely on technology.

104
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,880
We have to rely on my training,

105
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,250
something you droids don't have.

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,290
How do you know, Colonel?

107
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,690
Because droids don't get training.

108
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,900
You get programmed.

109
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,636
Clang!

110
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,030
That's your weakness.

111
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,446
So how is your training going
to lead us out of this void?

112
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,840
Well, uh, my, uh, training
as an officer tells me

113
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,980
to use all available resources
to, uh...

114
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,926
to stay alive until help comes.

115
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,050
So your officer training...

116
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,860
how exactly did you learn that?

117
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,460
It was drilled into me by my superiors.

118
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,836
Then you were programmed.

119
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,530
Just like us.

120
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:02,670
What?

121
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,500
No, I am not like you droids in any way.

122
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:08,570
I can think outside
my program...

123
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,140
I mean, my training.

124
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,480
And I can make decisions based
on a complex analysis

125
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,956
of a situation,

126
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,720
which is why I insist we return
to the ship.

127
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,896
Wait a minute.

128
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Why can't I find our tracks?

129
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,630
There are not any.

130
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,030
What?

131
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,300
I noticed it earlier.

132
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,870
This surface leaves no trace of us.

133
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,670
You noticed it earlier?

134
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,070
Why in the world
didn't you say anything?

135
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,340
I did not think we would want
to go backwards

136
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,650
when forwards seems to be
the only way out of this void.

137
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Why are you thinking?

138
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,490
I don't want you to think.

139
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,190
Thinking is my job.

140
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,190
I am the commanding officer.

141
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,490
You are just a pilot.

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,100
Oh, that hurt.

143
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,500
Ugh.

144
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,370
I have been thinking, Colonel.

145
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,710
I told you not to do that.

146
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:03,610
My programming keeps me
focused on the task at hand,

147
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,350
which means I do not have
to worry about my health.

148
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,096
I just have to worry about the mission.

149
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,190
Don't even go there.

150
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,560
So I think...

151
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,290
Don't do that!

152
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,630
When you die,
I should lead D-Squad.

153
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,530
Stop!

154
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,240
You are what's killing me!

155
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,720
I can't believe I am forced
to justify my existence

156
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,280
with a droid!

157
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,220
Ugh! I'm at the end!

158
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,550
I can feel it!

159
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,360
All I ask is that you
just let me die with dignity!

160
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,930
Is that possible?

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

162
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,980
Our ship?

163
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,120
You... you stupid lucky droids.

164
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,150
You have just taken us in a circle.

165
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,200
Wait a minute.

166
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,540
Is this really our ship?

167
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,010
How long have we been gone?

168
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,730
Ugh.

169
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
No, it is not our ship.

170
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,806
No, no, no!

171
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,300
No, no, no!

172
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,340
R2 is right.

173
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,850
This is what happens
when you stay at the ship.

174
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,220
Why is this happening to me?

175
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,670
Maybe he is going to jump

176
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,110
and put himself out of his misery.

177
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,120
Well, I vote for myself as
the new leader of this mission.

178
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,590
You cannot vote for R2.

179
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,320
He is just a mech.

180
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,930
He cannot lead a squadron.

181
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Help!

182
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,470
There has to be something out there!

183
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,110
Show me a sign.

184
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,920
A glimmer of hope!

185
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,830
I do not know who he is talking to.

186
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,830
Maybe whoever programmed him.

187
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,627
There!

188
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,780
I see something.

189
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,320
Ooh, a village!

190
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,300
What are you waiting for?

191
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,780
We're saved!

192
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:48,170
What exactly do you see, Colonel?

193
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,700
I don't know.

194
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,240
Hard to say.

195
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,570
An outpost.

196
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,910
Maybe a cantina.

197
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:58,720
Whatever it is, they can help us.

198
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,290
I do not see anything either, R2.

199
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,890
He should have jumped.

200
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,370
No.

201
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,910
We're going in circles again.

202
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,100
I agree.

203
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:00,600
We cannot trust his training anymore.

204
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,246
But I cannot trust your
programming either,

205
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,610
especially if you will not vote
for me to be the new leader.

206
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,010
Where are you going now?

207
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,420
Hey, that is not true.

208
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,390
I am more than just a pilot!

209
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:25,200
We need a new plan, Colonel.

210
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,770
I just realized:

211
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
What if I'm dead?

212
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,670
Ooh, what if I died
in that shuttle crash

213
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:35,710
and now... now I'm stuck here
in limbo?

214
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,220
Yes.

215
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,250
I should have gone with the mechs.

216
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,190
Think about it.

217
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,690
Life. Life is a void.

218
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,160
We search and search for answers,

219
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,700
but there are none.

220
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,170
Hope is just an illusion, WAC.

221
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,540
Death is the only certainty.

222
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,710
Giving up is not in my programming.

223
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,050
I am surprised that it
is in yours, Colonel.

224
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,060
Maybe...

225
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,230
maybe you're right.

226
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,240
I was taught to find a rational solution

227
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,940
to every problem.

228
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,880
But this void...

229
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,050
this proves that that's not
always possible.

230
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,820
Maybe I need to change how I see things,

231
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:28,760
and that will change my programming,

232
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:31,690
my training.

233
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:32,800
You know what?

234
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,870
You are more than just a pilot, WAC.

235
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,870
I knew it! I knew it!

236
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,110
All right, all right,
calm down, soldier.

237
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,780
Whoa! Whoa!

238
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,490
This is our way out of the void!

239
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,660
You have lost your mind, Colonel!

240
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:17,960
No!

241
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,890
This is our only hope!

242
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,600
We've got to stop following my training

243
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,370
or your programming

244
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,010
and follow the birds' instincts!

245
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,440
Grab hold!

246
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,580
Like this?

247
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,280
Whoa!

248
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,650
Look.

249
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,920
I can see a town from here.

250
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,290
You can see that, right?

251
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:13,130
I sure can.

252
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,670
How did you know, Colonel,

253
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,670
that these creatures would
get us out of the void?

254
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,580
You've got your programming.

255
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,550
I've got my training.

256
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,550
But these creatures,
they have their instinct.

257
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,290
They know how to survive out here.

258
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
If you say so.

259
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,010
I don't believe it.

260
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:14,950
Those mechs beat us here.

261
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,720
Stupid lucky droids.

262
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,590
Just like you said, Colonel.

263
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,930
Tell you what, WAC.

264
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,800
Why don't you get the squad
ready to roll?

265
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,780
I've got a second chance
to complete this mission,

266
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,480
and I intend to take advantage of it.

267
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,410
After I rehydrate myself.

268
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,920
That'll be all, Corporal.

269
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,490
Corporal?

270
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,800
Yes, sir.

271
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,460
The squad will be ready to roll.

272
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,000
Attention!

273
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,500
Front and center, soldiers!

274
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,480
I want us ready to roll pronto, pronto!

275
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,720
That is Corporal WAC to you, soldier.

276
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,520
And I will not tolerate insubordination!
